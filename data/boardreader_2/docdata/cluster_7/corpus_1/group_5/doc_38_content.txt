New jobless claims jumped to a 26-year high last week, and the trade deficit unexpectedly rose in October, according to separate reports on Thursday, a sign that the yearlong recession is deepening.  The number of workers filing first-time claims for unemployment aid surged 58,000 to 573,000 in the week ended Dec. 6, the most since November 1982, the Labor Department said. Wall Street expected 525,000.  The number of workers continuing to receive assistance rose by 338,000 to 4.43 million in the week ended Nov. 29, also a 26-year high.  Both measures were 16-year highs as a share of employment.  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC - News) said Thursday it will cut 30,000 to 35,000 jobs over the next three years.  Rising unemployment, tight credit and falling output have pushed the economy into its first recession since 2001, with conditions rapidly deteriorating in recent months. 'It's very worrisome, the speed at which the data are falling apart,' said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. 'You'll probably see a lot of people revising their GDP forecasts even lower.'The trade gap grew 1.1% to $57.2 billion in October, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Exports and imports fell for a third month, as global demand wilts.  Stocks sold off on the weak economic data, dim hopes for an auto industry bailout and surging oil prices. The Nasdaq fell 3.7%, the S&amp;amp;P 500 2.9% and the Dow 2.2%.  The trade and jobs data underscore that the U.S. can no longer count on exports and consumer spending to support growth. The economy shrank at a 0.5% annual rate in the third quarter, and many analysts say GDP may shrink at a 5% pace in the year-end quarter.  American households are focusing on repaying debt after losing more than $2.8 trillion in net wealth in the third quarter, the Federal Reserve said Thursday in its first flow of funds report. The 4.7% drop from April-June was the fourth straight quarterly decline.  Household debt shrank at an annualized 0.8% to $13.9 trillion during the quarter -- the first drop since records began in 1952.  With consumers retrenching, November retail sales outside autos fell 3.8%, the most since records began in 2003, according to MasterCard Advisors' SpendingPulse. Commerce releases its retail sales report Friday.  On a bright note, credit conditions seem to be easing. The London interbank offered rate on three-month dollar loans fell 10 basis points on Thursday to 2%, the lowest since September 2004, on sentiment that the Fed will cut interest rates next week.  The 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell six ticks this week to 5.77%, a 4-year low, Freddie Mac said. Home loan rates have dived since the Fed said it would buy $600 billion in certain mortgage debt.  Foreclosure filings fell 7% in November to 259,085, the lowest since June, RealtyTrac said. But that's due to government and lender efforts to curb defaults. Other reports show modified loans quickly go bad again and that seriously delinquent loans are surging.
