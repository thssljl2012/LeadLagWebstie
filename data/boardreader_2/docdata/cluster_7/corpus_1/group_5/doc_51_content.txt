Commonwealth Bank, the latest lender to test overseas markets, is launching a $1.25 billion issue of three and five-year bonds.  Several Australian banks, including ANZ and Westpac, are eyeing US and European funding markets, taking advantage of the Federal Government guarantee that effectively extends the Government's AAA-rating to their balance sheets.  While pressure has eased on short-term funding markets, long-term markets remain choked up, causing pricing to soar.  But Australian banks have been able to supplement funding from local investors as well as raising large quantities of deposits. 'They do not appear to have had much trouble raising capital from private markets when they wanted it,' Mr Stevens said in a speech to the Australian Business Economists annual dinner last night.  While credit conditions have tightened, Mr Stevens played down suggestions that banks might have engaged in the rationing of loans, particularly to business.  The pace of credit growth has slowed from a year ago  in the three months to October 31, lending growth to business was running at an annualised rate of 12 to 13 per cent.
