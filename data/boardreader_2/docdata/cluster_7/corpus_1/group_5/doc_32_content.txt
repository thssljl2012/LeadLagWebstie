The Australian dollar opened 1.74 per cent firmer as bleak jobs and trade reports indicate a deepening US recession and hitting the American currency.  At 0700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6708/11, up from Thursday's close of $US0.6591/95.  Overnight, the local unit traded between $US0.6570 and $US0.6801.  The domestic currency last touched 68 US cents in early November.  New claims for US unemployment benefits rose 58,000 to 573,000 in the week ending December 6, the US Department of Labour said.  It was the largest number of people applying for benefits since November 1982.  The US trade deficit widened against market forecasts, rising 1.1 per cent to $US57.2 billion ($A85.25 billion) in October from $US56.6 billion the month before, the US Department of Commerce said.  Market forecasts was for a trade deficit of $US53.5 billion.  Bank of America senior currency strategist John Rothfield said the weak reports for US trade and unemployment claims had possibly turned the market's sentiment against the US currency. 'Today, there has been a little bit of shift in sentiment overall about the US dollar,' he said from San Francisco. 'Up until now what has happened is weaker US data has tended to actually help the US dollar. 'The bid tone for the US dollar, which has been based on fear and risk aversion, is disappearing with a weak US economy.' Mr Rothfield said with no significant data in Australia on Friday, the Australian dollar's movements were linked to market sentiment on the US currency. 'A lot of it depends on whether we get any follow through in this weakening of US dollar,' he said. Mr Rothfield said there was scope for a weaker US dollar in the next few weeks, with the Australian unit being a beneficiary. 'We are in a year-end period where typically the US dollar weakens,' he said. 'That provides some upside potential for the Aussie dollar because most of the Australian data has been released.'
