SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- An index of consumer sentiment in Australia rose 7.5% in December from November. The index rose to 92.0 points in December in seasonally adjusted terms from 85.5 points in November, compilers Westpac Banking Corp. and the Melbourne Institute said in a statement Wednesday. In on-year terms, the consumer sentiment index fell a seasonally adjusted 18.2% in December. In trend terms, the index rose 5.9% in December from November, contributing to an 18.3% on-year decline. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said 'good news' on interest rates is finally gaining traction in the consumer space. 'Despite the announcement of a further 1% cut in the Reserve Bank's cash rate (in December), an 18.4% fall in petrol prices and a share market rally in recent weeks, it was not obvious that the Consumer Sentiment Index would have shown such a significant jump,' Evans said. 'The gloom surrounding the global economy and the associated threat to Australia could have easily overwhelmed all the positives.' However, the index is now up 16.4% from its low point this year and 3.3% above the average reading for 2008. The Reserve Bank of Australia has slashed interest rates three percentage points to 4.25% over its past four monthly policy meetings. This and the federal government's A$10.4 billion fiscal stimulus package have helped the number of people who say now is a good time to buy a major household item jump 28.2% in the month. 'It is sending a welcome message to beleaguered retailers as they move into the critical last few weeks before Christmas,' Evans said. 'Some restoration of confidence towards spending is the clear objective of the government's bold fiscal stimulus package.' The RBA is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting Feb. 3. Westpac expects the central bank will cut rates half a percentage point to 3.75% and says there is 'ample scope' for it to cut rates to below 3.0%. -By Sam Holmes, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2964; samuel.holmes@dowjones.com
