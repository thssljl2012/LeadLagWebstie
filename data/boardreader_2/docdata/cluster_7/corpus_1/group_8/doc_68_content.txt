Despite expectations that house prices will continue to fall in the near future, the majority of New Zealanders who took part in a recent survey by kiwi bank ASB are certain that now is a good time to buy The ASB housing confidence survey, which charted the three months to the beginning of February this year, found that 53 per cent of people think that now is a good time to be buying a property in New Zealand.  This result was an increase from the 45 per cent of respondents who thought it was the right time to buy in the previous quarter.  Lower interest rates and falling house prices lie behind this time to buy mentality, along with the hope that vendors may be more desperate to sell and thus more open to lower offers and bargaining tools.  First time buyers are also flocking back to the market, eager to get onto the first rung of the ladder in a market that was previously closed to them due to sky high prices. Whilst the lack of readily available mortgage finance is curtailing some buyers property dreams, the low consumer confidence seems to be starting to rise once more.  However, despite more than half thinking that now is the time to buy, there is little sign of property transactions rising, possibly due to the lack of urgency that buyers feel as they wait for prices to fall lower still.  The housing confidence survey also revealed that more than 60 per cent of people thought that house prices for New Zealand properties would continue to fall.  ASB Chief Economist Nick Tuffley said, The lower interest rates may have put a floor under turnover and could help some recovery in housing turnover during the year.
