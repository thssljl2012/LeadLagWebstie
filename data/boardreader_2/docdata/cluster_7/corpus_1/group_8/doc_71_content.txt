Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard is expected to cut the Official Cash Rate by between 50 - 100 basis points this week as the bank continues its attempts to revive the economy.  That could result in the Official Cash Rate going as low as 2.5%. It is currently 3.5%.  Last week, banks in Britain and Europe cut their benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point, but the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its rate on hold.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will also update its quarterly forecasts in its monetary policy statement due on Thursday.  ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley predicts that the bank will cut by a full percentage point, citing the speed at which the global economy continues to deteriorate.
