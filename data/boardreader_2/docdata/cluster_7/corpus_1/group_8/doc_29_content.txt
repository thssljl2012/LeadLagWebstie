(CEP News) - Markets will be watching Australian unemployment figures next week, as well as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's interest rate decision. In Japan, the Statistics Bureau will release final figures for fourth quarter GDP.  Economists expect Australia's unemployment rate to rise to 5.0% in February from 4.8%, and forecast a loss of 20,000 jobs in the month.  Riki Polygenis, an economist with ANZ Bank, said that so far the Australian labour market has held up well.  'While the unemployment rate has started to rise, the increase has been much more moderate than in other industrialized economies,' she said. She nevertheless expects the unemployment rate will climb amid the economic slowdown.  In New Zealand, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is set to release its cash rate. The RBNZ cut by 150 basis points at each of its last two meetings, and economists say the pace of rate cuts could slow down at the coming meeting.  Economists expect a 75 basis point cut to 2.75%.  Economists at Westpac are calling for a sharper 100 basis point cut. However, with the Reserve Bank of Australia decision last week to keep rate unchanged, it has placed 'a cat amongst the pigeons,' they noted. ...Continued  CEP Newswires - CEP News  2009.
