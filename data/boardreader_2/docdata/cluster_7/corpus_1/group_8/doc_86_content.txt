,  C ,  JPM (Cramer's Pick) ,  BAC  Interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have declined over the past few weeks, just as rates on fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) have trended upwards. But despite this shift, you still might want to think twice before applying for an ARM.  More from BankingMyWay.com  Market Activity  Bank of America Corporation  BAC  Citigroup Incorporated  C  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company  JPM  In mid-January, interest rates on five-year ARMs averaged 0.8 percentage points higher than the rates offered on 30-year FRMs, according to BankingMyWay.com's Rate Index. But since then, the gap has all but disappeared. Interest rates on five-year ARMs have dropped to 5.38% while rates on 30-year FRMs have risen to 5.36% -- a difference of just 0.02 percentage points.  The drop in the average rate on ARMs has caused a stir in activity among such mortgages, but homebuyers remain wary -- ARMs still account for only 2.3% of total mortgage applications, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The reluctance to embrace ARMs is well-founded: despite currently low interest rates, there are still significant long-term risks to applying for an ARM.  On a $200,000 mortgage, a five-year ARM with an initial rate of 5.38% might cost you $85,000 more in interest over the life of the loan as compared to a 30-year FRM at 5.36%. And that's provided your rate only adjusts upwards a maximum of 0.25% each year after the first five years of the initial rate.  If rates rise faster than that -- and some analysts predict that double-digit interest rates could go hand-in-hand with a recovering economy -- the extra cost of that ARM could easily reach $150,000 or more in added interest charges.
