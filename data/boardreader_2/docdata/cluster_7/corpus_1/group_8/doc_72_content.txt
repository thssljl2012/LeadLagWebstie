Economists say the levels of New Zealand house sales remain weak, despite an optimistic interpretation placed by real estate agents on figures they released.  Darren Gibbs, chief economist for Deutsche Bank in New Zealand, said that with valuations still 'stretched' house prices were likely to continue dropping before beginning to stabilise in 2010.  And Shamubeel Eaqub, director of research for Goldman Sachs JBWere has cast doubt on the Real Estate Institute (REINZ) calculation of a drop of just 2.2 per cent - to $NZ330,000 ($A257,591) - in the national median house price over the past year.  'We suspect house prices are instead falling at a more rapid pace,' said Mr Eaqub.  The warning came on the eve of the Reserve Bank making a further cut on Thursday in the official cash rate (OCR), predicted by many analysts to be a drop of 100 basis points, to 2.5 per cent.  Mr Eaqub said that median house prices were not the best measure of house prices over time, as they were not adjusted for changes in the composition of sales.  Quotable Value QV housing data - which was adjusted - showed house prices actually fell 8.9 per cent for the three months to February compared to year-ago levels.  'Housing demand remains weak and is likely to remain so as consumer confidence remains soft,' he said.  The 23.7 per cent lift in the number of days a property took to sell was actually 'indicating oversupply of homes for sale'.  Economic uncertainties and reduced job security will continue to curb interest in the housing market despite below-average mortgage rates. And agency data suggested there was a large overhang of listings on the market.  'With the large excess of supply, buyers will remain in a position to drive prices lower,' said Mr Eaqub.  ASB Bank economist Jane Turner said that after adjusting for the usual post-holiday period 'bounce' sales had recovered only 8.3 per cent - following from the previous month's 6.8 per cent fall.
