Australia's interest rate stands at 3.25 percent now. * Heightened expectations of rate cuts spurred investors to pile into shorter-term bond futures, extending earlier gains. * Three-year bond futures rose 0.07 points to 96.975, and the 10-year contract added 0.04 points to 95.73. * The RBA skipped a chance to cut rates at its monthly policy meeting last week, saying it preferred to wait and see the effects of its massive 400-basis-point easing since September. * The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) cut rates by 50 basis points on Thursday to a record low of 3 percent, although the move confounded expectations among some investors for a bigger cut. * RBNZ's rate cut pushed the Aussie lower against the Kiwi as investors pared expectations for bigger interest rate differentials between Australia and New Zealand. * Aussie dropped to NZ$1.2644, from Wednesday's NZ$1.2830. * Revised data showed on Thursday Japan's economy shrank 3.2 percent last quarter, confirming the Japanese economy is fighting its sharpest contraction since the oil crisis in 1974.
