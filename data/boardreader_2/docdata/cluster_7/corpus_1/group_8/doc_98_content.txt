 Market watch top headlines Australian reports Aust markets:  :  :  World reports World commodities:  World markets:   FCL, QAN, PBG, MGR, SUN, CBA, WBC, ANZ, NAB, AIA,   AAP 2009-03-04   Retailers are calling on consumers to come out of financial hibernation and spend, spend, spend to help save jobs.  Monthly retail sales were up 0.2 per cent in January, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  Australian Retailers Association director Richard Evans said low petrol prices, reductions in interest rates and the federal government's $10.4 billion stimulus package had contributed to the rise.  But Mr Evans said many people were still in financial hibernation. 'We're cashed up ... most Australians are doing quite well right now ... they are financially hibernating though,' Mr Evans told ABC Television. 'And what we're trying to say to them is now's the time to start coming out of that hibernation and start re-entering the market place. 'If they start spending the money again they are likely to save their job.' Mr Evans said the positive retail spending figures were likely to continue throughout the year. 'This is generally a slow time for retailers ... but we have rate reductions last year which are going to hit the market probably this month and ... April.' 'We have also got the Rudd stimulus package again hitting the market. 'We're anticipating (this) growth to start slowly coming back in May-June ... (and) good growth probably in the September quarter.'
