Mar 2009 The New Zealand dollar traded in a narrow range against the greenback as the kiwi failed to push higher despite surprisingly strong housing data in the United States whetting risk appetite.   By 8am today the NZ dollar was buying US53.03c having traded in a range between about US53.25c and US52.75c in the previous 24 hours. It was unable to regain the five-week high around US53.40c reached early yesterday.   ANZ bank said failed attempts to push through the barrier in the mid-US53c area had left the NZ dollar tentatively testing the downside.   The relatively positive US housing data managed to evolve some support for the US dollar overnight.   The US dollar rose against the yen on the back of an unexpected rise in February housing starts and plans by the Bank of Japan to buy subordinated loans which raised fears the central bank would flood the market with yen.   The euro also rose above 128 yen, just shy of its highest level this year, and gained against the greenback, lifted partly by data showing stronger-than-expected German investor sentiment.   The NZ dollar eased to 0.4076 euro at today's local open from 0.4085 at 5pm yesterday, and was barely changed against the Japanese currency at 52.21 yen at 8am.   The kiwi was also down against the Australian dollar to A80.21c at 8am from A80.40c at the local close. The trade weighted index was 53.99 at 8am from 54.09 at 5pm.
