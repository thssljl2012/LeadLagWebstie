The Australian dollar peaked at around the $US0.65 level on 11 March 2009, compared with $US0.635 previously. The currency was bolstered by strong gains on local and international sharemarkets. However, the ANZ Bank is bearish about the outlook for the dollar, and says it could test the $US0.50 level by the end of the year.
