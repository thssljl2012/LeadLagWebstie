The Australian dollar has opened lower as increased risk aversion prompted investors to sell higher-yielding currencies. At 0700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6313/18, down 1.26 per cent from Monday's close of $US0.6395/99. During the overnight session, the unit moved between $US0.6310 and $US0.6420. The Australian dollar hit its offshore session high in early London trade before being dragged lower as the British pound fell on reaction to the British government taking a majority stake in Lloyds Banking Group on the weekend. Shares in Lloyds fell by 14 per cent in early trade before closing 9.76 per cent lower on Monday. On Saturday, the British government announced an agreement to protect STG260 billion ($A571 billion) of the bank's riskiest assets. The deal will increase the government's ownership of the group from 43 per cent to 65 per cent. Commonwealth Bank vice-president of institutional banking and markets, Tim Kelleher, said the Australian dollar had struggled in an environment in which risk aversion strengthened. 'The sterling was hit very hard in London opening, so all risk aversion was off the table,' Mr Kelleher said from Auckland. 'This was just a flow-on from Lloyds being semi-nationalised on the weekend. 'It was a pretty easy drift for the Aussie and kiwi after that.' US equity markets closed weaker, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.21 per cent and the S&amp;P 500 index was 1.00 per cent lower. 'Once the sentiment turned on the sterling and UK banking stocks, the risk aversion trades took over,' he said. Local data due for release on Tuesday includes the National Australia Bank's business survey and the ANZ Banking Group's jobs ads survey, both for February. In January, the measure of business confidence in the monthly survey slumped to a new low in the 20 years of the series. Mr Kelleher expected the Australian dollar to trade between $US0.6270 to $US0.6330 during the local session.
