Figures released by the ANZ Bank show newspaper job advertisements in South Australia fell by just over 22 per cent in February.  The figures show it was the third lowest fall, with steeper declines in the Northern Territory, Western Australia , New South Wales and Queensland.  A spokesman for the ANZ says the trend suggests a national unemployment rate of 6.5 per cent by the end of 2009.
