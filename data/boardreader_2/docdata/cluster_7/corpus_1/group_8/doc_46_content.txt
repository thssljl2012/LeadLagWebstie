The number of job ads in newspapers and on the internet dropped more than 10 per cent last month - the biggest monthly fall in the series compiled by the ANZ Bank. There are now 40 per cent fewer positions advertised than a year ago. The trends suggest 'a substantial rise in the unemployment rate is likely', said ANZ's head of Australian economics, Warren Hogan.  A report on the retail sector by Access Economics, to be published today, points to a grim year on the shopping front.  Government cash bonuses will help maintain spending levels until the middle of the year. But in the 2009-10 financial year retail sales are expected to grow by an anaemic 0.2 per cent, adjusted for inflation, sparking more job losses in the sector.  NSW will be at the forefront of the downturn. Sales are dropping because of the state's rising jobless rate and relatively high levels of household debt.
