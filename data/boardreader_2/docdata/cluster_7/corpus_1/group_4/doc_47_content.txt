 jobs - or 10 per cent of its workforce - as the world financial crisis takes its toll.  An unnamed source, described as 'well placed', told Fairfax newspapers the bank was looking to aggressively cut costs in the face of the downturn, and planned to axe 3,000 to 3,500 workers and contractors.  The redundancies are expected at least two weeks before Christmas, the source said.  'They are moving through the entire organisation. They are trying to take as much cost pressure out as they can,' the source told Fairfax.  ANZ spokesman Paul Edwards would not commit to a figure but said a restructure would most affect middle management and would affect less than 10 per cent of the workforce.  'Although we have said we don't expect the new structure to impact frontline roles, inevitably there will be an impact on roles in middle management,' Mr Edwards said.  The job losses would follow the announcement of big job cuts at a range of firms including Qantas and Ford.  Meanwhile, the Finance Sector Union says that up to 10,000 jobs could go in the next 12 to 18 months if the big banks restructure their workforces.  FSU national secretary Leon Carter said speculation that ANZ Bank planned to cut 3,000 of its staff in the lead-up to Christmas could trigger mass sackings at the other big banks.  Already there is speculation that Westpac will shed 5,000 jobs when it merges with St George.  'We think that 10,000 jobs could disappear out of the banking sector over the next 12 to 18 months,' Mr Carter told reporters in Melbourne Friday.  He called on the federal government to pressure the banks to forgo sackings after it gave taxpayer-funded guarantees on all savings in Australian banks.
