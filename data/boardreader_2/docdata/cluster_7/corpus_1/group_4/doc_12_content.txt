There is more evidence the global financial turmoil has gripped the Australian economy, with a steep drop in the number of jobs being advertised.   ANZ bank's survey has found 5.9 per cent fewer jobs were advertised online and in newspapers in October than the month before.   Newspaper job ads also tumbled by 12.2 per cent.   ANZ's head of economics, Warren Hogan, says there has not been such a steep fall in newspaper ads since 1991 and 1982, when the economy was in recession.   He says the figures indicate a sharp slowdown from the latest 2.7 per cent annual economic growth rate. 'Certainly we're going to be seeing growth in this economy for the next few years of sub two per cent at the best,' he said.'He expects the unemployment rate to rise from four-point-three-per-cent to six-and-a-half-per-cent in 2010.'
