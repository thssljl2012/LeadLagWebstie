The Treasury has allowed two more financial companies to opt-in to the Government's $150 billion deposits guarantee scheme.  The PSIS and NZF Money are the latest to have their retail deposits in New Zealand guaranteed for the next two years.  They join ASB, Bank of New Zealand, Kiwibank, TSB, the Southland Building Society, HSBC and Rabobank.  The deposit guarantee was announced by the Government on 12 October.
