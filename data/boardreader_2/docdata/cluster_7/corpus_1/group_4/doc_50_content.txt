The Age newspaper in Australia is reporting that hundreds and possibly thousands of jobs will go from the ANZ within weeks.  The bank wants to aggressively reduce costs in the face of the economic slowdown.  The article does not mention whether the bank's New Zealand staff will be impacted.  It says a well-placed source who is aware of ANZ's plans said the bank will axe up to 3,500 staff and contractors, which is ten percent of its workforce.  The redundancies will occur at least two weeks before Christmas and will mostly affect middle management.  ------  An economist believes New Zealand's economic situation is likely to be worse than Treasury's latest predictions.  Treasury presents a gloomy picture for incoming Prime Minister John Key - predicting rising unemployment, growing government debt and shrinking growth.  But Deutsche Bank chief economist, Darren Gibbs, says Treasury's predictions are two months out of date and the global situation has worsened considerably since then.  Treasury is hoping to complete a more accurate picture today.  ------  October's real estate figures paint a better than expected picture.  Real Estate Institute vice-president Peter McDonald says a year ago, commentators were predicting a 30 percent fall in property values.  But he says the institute's figures show an overall decrease of just 4.28 percent.  Northland, Hawke's Bay, Taranaki, Wellington, and Southland recorded increases in the value of residential properties for sale.  ------  On the markets, the NZX50 is down 43 points to 2,730.
