 A senior executive at one of Britain's biggest high street banks has warned that it may not pass on the full effect of an interest rate cut to customers.  HSBC chief operating officer David Hodgkinson said there could be some 'stickiness' even if the Bank of England reduced rates as expected on Thursday.  Mr Hodgkinson, who is part of a business delegation accompanying Prime Minister Gordon Brown on a tour of the Gulf, said credit had been 'mispriced' over recent years.  He added: 'As an adjustment process that is taking place, clearly if interest rates are down significantly the rates for borrowing will go down but I am not going to say it is absolutely linear, because it depends on the particular (situation) and the risk.'  Asked if that meant there would be 'stickiness' in rates, Mr Hodgkinson replied: 'Yes.'  His remarks comes as Gordon Brown hinted at another emergency global interest cut yesterday amid warnings that UK unemployment is set to soar to almost 3million.  The Prime Minister promised 'co-ordinated action' across the world as pressure grew on the Bank of England to slash the cost of borrowing.  However, many experts warn that a rush to cut rates is 'too little, too late' because Britain is already in what is predicted to be a long and deep recession.  Mr Brown, speaking on a tour of Gulf states, gave another clear signal that he wants to see aggressive interest rate cuts.  'Now that inflation is brought under control we are going to see, as we have seen, two cuts in interest rates, and I believe that the trend around the world... is to respond to the falling oil price and the falling food prices that we're seeing at the moment,' the Prime Minister said.  Six central banks, including the Bank of England, cut interest rates by half a percentage point last month in an effort to shore up the stuttering global economy.  The unprecedented step failed to cheer world stock markets.  But Mr Brown signalled yesterday that further coordinated cuts could be negotiated at a summit of world leaders later this month.  'I think what we're seeing round the world is an ability also to come together,' he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme.  'We had a coordinated interest rate cut a few weeks ago. We've seen coordinated action on bringing the banks back into action by capitalising them.  'We've got coordinated action... that's what this November 15 meeting is about.'  As economic bad news continued to pile up, leading accountants Deloitte forecast that UK unemployment will soar to almost 3million over the next two years.  City economist Roger Bootle predicted that 2.9million Britons will be out of work by the end of 2010, up from the current total of 1.79million.  With the British economy now in reverse and small businesses collapsing under the pressure, the outlook for jobs is bleak.  Mr Bootle said he feared unemployment could prove to be worse than that experienced during the early-Nineties recession.  He echoed calls for a dramatic cut in interest rates to help resuscitate the economy, saying they should fall from the current 4.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent - their lowest level since 1951.  The Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets this week to decide on UK rates and a half percentage cut to 4 per cent is seen as inevitable.  But economists at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and HSBC believe rates will be slashed by a full one percentage point to 3.5 per cent, which would be the biggest reduction in the committee's 11-year history.  Mr Bootle said: 'Plummeting house prices, sluggish income growth and soaring inflation is already weighing down on consumer spending growth and will continue to do so.  'It is critical that the Government tries to stimulate the economy with low interest rates. It's crazy we have rates at 4.5 per cent when America has one per cent and Japan only 0.3 per cent.'   Pressure for further cuts was heightened yesterday by desperate news from the Institute of Directors, showing business confidence plummeting to a new record low.  Graham Leach, chief economist at the IoD, said: 'The falls in business confidence and investment intentions take us into completely uncharted territory.'  However, there were warnings that few mortgage lenders will pass on the full extent of this week's expected interest rate cut.  'Even fewer lenders than last time will pass on any rate cut that is made this week,' said Darren Cook of the financial information group Moneyfacts.  'They won't be able to pass on any of the base rate cuts until money market Libor rates [of inter-bank lending] decline.'  In the wake of the last rate cut by the Bank of England in October, most British mortgage lenders failed to pass on the full rate cut to customers, as the cost of obtaining funds in the money markets remained high.  Mr Brown confirmed yesterday the Government intends to bring forward housing and energy projects in an attempt to inject money into the economy.  'Every country is planning to invest more to help people come through these times,' he said.  Mr Brown failed to deny suggestions that his borrowing spree was storing up the equivalent of around 4p on income tax at a later stage.  'I think what every country is doing is recognising that you need to act to get the economy moving, so the first priority is to get the economy moving and that is the action that we are taking,' he said.  Here's what readers have had to say so far. Why not add your thoughts below?  The Bank of England can slash all it likes. If the mortgage lenders don't, it will all fall flat.   My Tracker morgage has a clause in it that says below 3.25% it is at the discretion of the lender as to wether or not it keeps tracking.   The Government should insist that any bank that recieves a taxpayer bailout must pass on rate cuts in full.   I bet a lot of the banks pleading poverty would turn around and say they didn't realy need the money if that was the case - look at Barclays, going for foriegn capital so it doesn't need d Govt money with Govt rules.  - John, UK, 03/11/2008 08:19  This fool Brown is causing the meltdown. Would any bank lend money to a householder in negative equity who cannot meet the repayments? Last year perhaps yes, now definitely No. So why do you lend to our unelected Prime Minister?  - Ralph, Swindon, England, 03/11/2008 07:55  More than one credit card should not be allowed.  - Mike Westwood, Brixham.
