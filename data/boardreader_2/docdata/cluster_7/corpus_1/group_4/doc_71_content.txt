rnal debt has touched Dh623.9 billion this year, according to a latest estimate.   Dubai's non-bank foreign-currency debt, at just under $70 billion (Dh257.46 billion), is much higher than the gross domestic product.  These figures could raise eyebrows among many analysts. Some might term the situation as 'overborrowing'. However, one should not underestimate the government's strengths and the banking sector's resilience.   After all, this country is bailing out Barclays and some other international institutions.   International Monetary Fund said the UAE's total government debt is expected to come down to 9.4 per cent of the GDP by the end of the year, compared to 10.6 per cent in 2007.   The UAE's current account balance is expected to jump 56 per cent to $60.9 billion by the end of 2008, up from $39.1 billion last year. These numbers clearly demonstrate the UAE's strengths.
