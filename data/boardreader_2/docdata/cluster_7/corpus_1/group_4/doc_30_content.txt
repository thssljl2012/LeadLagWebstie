Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan says he is disappointed the major banks have chosen not to pass on all of Tuesday's cut in official interest rates.  Australia's Reserve Bank cut official rates by three quarters of a percentage point.  However, ANZ, Westpac and the National Australia Bank have joined the Commonwealth Bank in witholding part of the cut.  Treasurer Swan says banks are facing higher borrowing costs, but it's important rate reductions are passed on. 'I do acknowledge they passed on in full previously, 125 basis points and that has been of considerable benefit to households and to businesses out there and I certainly call on the banks to pass on the rest of this cut as soon as possible,' he said.
