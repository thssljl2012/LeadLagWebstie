ASB has become the first of the big retail banks to gain protection under the Government's retail deposit guarantee scheme.  Westpac filed the paperwork with The Treasury on Monday, and the Bank of New Zealand followed yesterday.  Westpac and New Zealand's biggest bank, ANZ National, have said they were still preparing their applications.  The Government said on October 12 that it would stand behind all retail deposits for the next two years.  Revisions of the scheme have since capped the guarantee at $1 million for each bank customer. Wealthy investors with more than $1 million in deposits could spread their money across several banks and still have it all protected.  The guarantee followed a similar decision by Australia and ensures that retail customers would not lose their money if their bank failed.  In addition to ASB, six other registered banks have been approved for the scheme. They are state-owned Kiwibank, TSB Bank, Southland Building Society, Citibank's New Zealand branch, Rabobank New Zealand and its Dutch parent.  Finance companies and fund managers could also apply to have their deposits and some investment funds guaranteed. None had been approved by yesterday.  The Government has also offered to guarantee wholesale funding to New Zealand banks.
