Rams Home Loans (Rams) has dropped the interest rate on its standard variable home loan by 60 basis points.  The interest rate on Rams' standard variable home loan has dropped 0.6 percentage points to 7.59 per cent, while the interest rate on Rams' basic home loan is now 6.99 per cent.  Rams' move follows a 75 basis point cut to Australia's official cash rate made by the Reserve Bank of Australia last Tuesday that prompted other big lenders to cut their rates.  The official cash rate now stands at 5.25 per cent.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was the first to pass on the RBA's rate cut last Tuesday, with Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac), National Australia Bank (NAB) and St George Bank following suit since then.  The interest rates on standard variable home loans for Australia's major banks now stands at 7.23 per cent at CBA, 7.71 per cent at Westpac, 7.74 per cent at NAB and St George Bank, and 8.32 per cent at ANZ Banking Group.  Home lender Rams sold its brand-name and distribution business to Westpac earlier this year because it was unable to refinance its loans.
