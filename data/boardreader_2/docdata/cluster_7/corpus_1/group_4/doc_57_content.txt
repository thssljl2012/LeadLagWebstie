The National Bank, ANZ and ASB have cut interest rates on a range of loans, hot on the heels of cuts by Westpac and Kiwibank yesterday.  Meanwhile, economists at Deutsche Bank are now picking the Reserve Bank will cut 150 basis points off the official cash rate at its next review on December 4. Deutsche says the collapse in global commodity prices and easing inflationary pressures, mean the Reserve Bank could cut the OCR by 150 basis points to 5 percent from 6.5 percent.  The National Bank said today it has cut variable home loan rates from 9.45 percent to 8.70 percent, and reduced the rate on its Thoroughbred Flexible loans from 9.7 percent to 8.95 pc.  ANZ spokeswoman Jessamy Malcolm said the ANZ Standard Variable home loan rate would be cut from 9.45 pc to 8.7 pc, with the cuts taking effect on Monday 24 November 2008 for existing customers.  'For new and existing ANZ Flexiplus customers, the rate cut from 9.7 percent to 8.95 percent will come into effect on Wednesday 10 December 2008,' she said.  ASB is cutting variable rates to 8.7 percent from 9.45 percent, six month fixed rates to 7.35 percent from 7.99 percent, one year rates to 7.4 percent from 8.10 percent, 18 month rates to 7.5 percent from 8.1 percent, two year rates to 7.5 percent from 8.1 percent, three year rates to 7.75 percent from 8.3 percent, four year rates to 8 percent from 8.5 percent and five year rates to 8.25 percent from 8.75 percent.  Yesterday Westpac cut two year fixed interest home loans from 8.10 to 7.35 percent and the floating mortgage rate from 9.45 to 8.7 percent.  Kiwibank followed suit, chopping the rate by 0.75 percent from 8.70 to 7.95 percent. Its two year fixed mortgage rate is now 7.59 percent, down from 7.75 percent for those with 20 percent or more equity in their property.
