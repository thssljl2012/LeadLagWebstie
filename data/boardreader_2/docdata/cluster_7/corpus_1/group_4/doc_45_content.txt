 jobs could go in the next 12 to 18 months if the big banks restructure their workforces, the Finance Sector Union (FSU) says.  FSU national secretary Leon Carter said speculation that ANZ Bank planned to cut up to 3500 of its staff in the lead-up to Christmas could trigger mass sackings at the other big banks.  Already there is speculation that Westpac will shed 5000 jobs when it merges with St George.'We think that 10,000 jobs could disappear out of the banking sector over the next 12 to 18 months,' Mr Carter told reporters in Melbourne today.He ced on the Federal Government to pressure the banks to forgo sackings after it gave taxpayer-funded guarantees on  savings in Australian banks.  The union's claim followed a report in The Age today that the ANZ plans to cut up to 3500 jobs.  ANZ Bank denied it plans to lay off up to 10% of its workforce as a part of a restructuring of its middle management.'What we are undertaking is a significant belt tightening exercise over the coming weeks and months - the focus is on middle management roles - but at this stage its not possible to be more definitive on numbers,' a spokeswoman for the bank said.  A source familiar with the matter said the final number would be more than 500 jobs, with the cuts expected by February.  The FSU lamented the confusion surrounding the job cuts.  ''ANZ Bank staff going into work today face an uncertain future,' said Mr Carter said in a statement.  ''The bank must put an end to the smoke and mirrors talk of restructurings and give workers guarantees about their jobs.''The bank is being cold-hearted to start rumours of job cuts just six weeks before Christmas.'ANZ's profits fell 21% in 2007-08, as rising charges for bad debts and narrowing profits undermined earnings. The bank posted $3.3 billion in profits in the year to September 2008 from $4.2 billion last year.  AAP with Chris Zappone, BusinessDay
