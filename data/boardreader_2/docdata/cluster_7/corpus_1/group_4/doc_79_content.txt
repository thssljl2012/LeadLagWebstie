Unemployment Near Its Peak, Barclays Says  (RTTNews) - Initial jobless claims are likely to remain at a heightened level and reach 480,000 in the week ending November 1. Although hurricane distortions are no longer in effect, the level of claims has been unchanged for the past two periods. This suggests a troubling increase of 10,000 in the underlying trend for claims, suggest the analysts at Barclays Capital. Although the economic contraction persists, we see further distress in the labor market as employers affected by faltering demand continue to shed workers. We expect the level of claims to reach a peak of 500,000 in 2009.  Nonfarm productivity growth should decelerate to just 0.3 percent quarter-over-quarter ar in 3Q from 4.3 percent in 2Q. Nonfarm gross value added  a GDP-like measure counting only the output of the nonfarm business sectors  declined by 1.7 percent quarter-over-quarter ar during the quarter and we estimate that hours worked declined by 2 percent quarter-over-quarter ar. Compensation growth likely remained elevated, despite the emergence of significant slack in the labor market. We forecast that nonfarm compensation per hour increased to 5.0 percent quarter-over-quarter ar in 3Q. Our forecasts for productivity and compensation growth imply that unit labor costs increased by 4.6 percent quarter-over-quarter ar or 2.4 percent year-over-year.
