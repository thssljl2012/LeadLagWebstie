All four of Australia's big banks have now moved to reduce their variable home loan interest rates.  With the Commonwealth banks announcing the cut on Tuesday, Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank followed yesterday.  However, none of the banks passed on the full 75 basis point cut by the Reserve Bank, citing substantially higher funding costs.  Westpac says it'll cut its standard variable mortgage rate by 65 basis points to 7.71 per cent, effective from November 10.  NAB cut its variable mortgage interest rate by 62 basis points to 7.74 per cent per annum.  ANZ has also lowered its rate to 7.74 per cent per annum, while the Commonwealth reduced its variable rates by 58 basis points.
