 d in September, as consumer spending eased over fears of an economic slowdown.  Retail sales for September gained 0.2%, from 0.3% in August, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show. Analysts were expecting a rise of 0.2%.  The Reserve Bank, which meets to discuss a rate cut tomorrow, had focused on retail sales six months ago when it raised rates to a decade-high, said Moody's Economy.com Matt Robinson.  'You've now got the double-downward pressure of the tight monetary policy of six months ago as well as the global financial market turmoil. And the global economic slowdown is going to doubly weigh on household consumption.'  Other signs of weakness are filtering through the economy, as well.  Jobs advertised online and in newspapers tumbled 5.9% in October to an average of 231,135 per week, bringing it 9.8% lower than a year ago at this time, according to ANZ Bank, which prepared the monthly survey.  That's the biggest monthly drop since February of 2001. In trend terms, total job ads dropped 2.6% in October.
