WELLINGTON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - New Zealand's jobless rate rose to its highest level in nearly five years in the third quarter, as the recession started to be felt, easing the tight labour market and likely paving the way to further interest rate cuts. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2 percent -- its highest since December 2003 -- from 3.9 percent in the previous quarter as the growth in the labour force outstripped the growth in jobs. **************************************************************** KEY POINTS: - Employment grew 0.1 percent s/adj (forecast 0.6 percent fall), as growth in full-time employment offset loss of part time jobs. - Participation rate up 0.1 percent to 68.7 percent (forecast 68.3 percent). - Click on for a table of the main figures. COMMENTARY: DARREN GIBBS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK 'There was always the risk the market was too early in looking for employment to be weak, the anecdotes have only really become weak late in the quarter, through to October. The bottom line is that the unemployment rate is rising, its on an upward trend, and over the next 12 months we're going to see that deterioration accelerate. From next quarter onwards we're going to see quite chunky employment declines. There's nothing from the report to advance the case for a 100 basis point cut, but I certainly think the case does exist.' PHILIP BORKIN, ECONOMIST, ANZ-NATIONAL BANK 'The unemployment rate is better than expected and employment growth has effectively been flat, which is a bit of a surprise given the state of the domestic economy, and the anecdotes from recent business surveys. It does suggest the labour market is not as weak as initially feared. I don't think there's too many implications to take from this. The unemployment rate is the one to watch and it does show the labour market is turning, which will give the Reserve Bank confidence wage pressures will start to subside. Our expectations of a 75 basis point cut in December are maintained.' JOSHUA WILLIAMSON, SENIOR STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES 'It is better than expected and shows some resilience in the New Zealand economy. But in the next quarter we could see the numbers deteriorate as there is a systemic recession on there and the economy is feeling the impact of the global credit crunch. This won't alter expectations that the Reserve Bank will continue to cut interest rates.' STEPHEN HALMARICK, CO-HEAD MARKET ECONOMICS, CITI 'It's slightly stronger than expected, but with the economy in recession it's fairly safe to assume the labour market will weaken going forward. It does nothing to change the outlook for more policy easing from the RBNZ.' MARKET REACTION: - The New Zealand dollar rose to $0.5984/91 from $0.5964/71 before the data. The December bank bill contract was unchanged for a yield of 6.17 percent compared with the official cash rate of 6.5 percent.

The credit crunch, global turmoil and a previously elevated NZ currency have also hit export industries. - The Reserve Bank of New Zealand last month cut its official cash rate by a record 1 percentage point to 6.5 percent, its third rate cut since July. It has said further rate cuts are likely given the deteriorating economic outlook will constrain still stubbornly high inflation pressures. - Fifteen of 16 economists surveyed by Reuters expect the central bank to cut the cash rate by at least 50 basis points at its Dec. 4 monetary policy statement. - The NZ Institute of Economic Research's third quarter business opinion survey showed a net 11 percent of respondents shed staff in the past three months, and a net 7 percent planned to cut staff over the next three months. - The labour cost index released on Monday showed private sector wages rose a record 3.7 percent in the year to Sept. 30. The accompanying quarterly employment survey showed a fall of 0.3 percent in the number of total paid hours and a fall of 0.6 percent in the number of total filled jobs on the previous quarter.
