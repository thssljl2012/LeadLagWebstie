Over half of investors (58 per cent) believe interest rates should fall by one per cent this week  Ahead of the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) decision on interest rates this week, research* from Barclays Stockbrokers reveals over half (58 per cent) of investors believe interest rates should fall by a full percentage point. More than a quarter of investors (27 per cent) believe interest rates should fall by half a percentage point.  The survey reveals only a minority of those polled (five per cent) think interest rates are in line for a 0.25 per cent cut. A tenth of those surveyed think interest rates should stay the same this week.  Barbara-Ann King, Head of Proposition at Barclays Stockbrokers, says: 'With the decision on interest rates looming this week, the majority of the respondents to this poll believe decisive action needs to be taken by the MPC to help the economy. With only a small amount of respondents believing rates will hold at 4.5%, even a fall of half a percentage point won't be enough for most people.'
