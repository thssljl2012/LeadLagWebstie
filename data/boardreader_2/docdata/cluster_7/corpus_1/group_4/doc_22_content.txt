New Zealands Reserve Bank may follow its Australian counterpart and slash the official cash rate by 75 basis points at its next meeting, ANZ Bank economists predict.  Yesterday the Reserve Bank of Australia announced a cut in Australias official cash rate from 6% to 5.25%, the third reduction in three months.  And according to an ANZ Bank economic forecast, New Zealands Reserve Bank governor Alan Bollard may mimic the move.  We now expect the Reserve Bank to follow suit with a 75 basis point cut in December, mindful that the same forces shaping the growth and inflation outlook are also at play in New Zealand.  This is a more aggressive cut than others are predicting, with economists from several other banks indicating a 50-point cut when the Reserve Bank next meets on December 4.  And Australias official cash rate may be even lower by then.  The Reserve Bank of Australia meets monthly, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets every six weeks.  This means the Reserve Bank of Australia meets again two days before the Reserve Bank, and it is expected to announce a further cut of 50 points after that meeting.  New Zealands official cash rate is currently 6.5% after Dr Bollard last month cut the rate by 100 basis points.
