Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE mass job cuts announced by Citigroup overnight will affect its Australian workforce, the company says.  The US banking giant said it would slash 50,000 jobs worldwide as it tightens its belt further to cope with a global financial crisis and heavy losses. It is the second largest job-cut announcement on record.  'There will be a small reduction in our workforce for Citi Australia,' a spokesperson told news.com.au.  Citigroup has 2500 employees in Australia, primarily in Sydney and Melbourne.  Earlier this month, a banking executive said up to 10,000 jobs would be lost from the local industry next year, as the major financial institutions cut costs.  KPMG head of banking Andrew Dickinson said he expected about 2000 jobs to be cut from each of the five major banks over the coming year.  Thousands of jobs are expected to be lost from the merger of Westpac and St George, which was approved by shareholders last week.  The Australianreported 2000 jobs will be cut, mostly from the technology and back-office operations. But the Finance Sector Union warned the job losses could be higher, with up to 5000 positions under threat.  NAB cut 179 technology staff last week, on top of the 264 revealed earlier this year. Suncorp last week said it would cut 350 staff, on top of the 200 it has already lost by merging its retail and banking businesses.  And more than 40 senior bankers have been sacked from ANZ in the past few weeks, as the bank reduces management layers.
