Westpac has cut its standard variable home loan rate by 65 basis points, falling short of yesterday's 0.75 percentage point reduction by the Reserve Bank.  The reduction, to come into effect on Monday, will lower Westpac's rate to 7.71%.  Westpac joins the Commonwealth Bank in failing to pass on the full rate cut by the RBA. The CBA yesterday cuts its standard mortgage rate by 58 basis points to 7.74%, also taking effect on Monday.  Westpac said it will also reduce interest rates on consumer credit cards and business credit cards by up to 80 basis points, from 14 November.  ''Westpac is sensitive to the challenges being faced by many working families, however, we are still having to meet substantially higher funding costs,'' Westpac group executive, retail and business banking, Peter Hanlon said.  The bank said that small business owners in particular would benefit from reduced credit card interest rates.  The RBA lowered its key cash rate to 5.25%, its lowest in five years, and warned that the global economic turmoil would hurt Australia.  In October, the RBA slashed its lending rate by a full percentage point, which the big banks eventually passed on -- in two batches of cuts.  The ANZ Bank and the National Australia Bank are expected to announce cuts in interests shortly.  More to come  BusinessDay with AAP
