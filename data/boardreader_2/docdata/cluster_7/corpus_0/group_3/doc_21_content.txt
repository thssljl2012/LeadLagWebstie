Two High Street mortgage lenders have increased their tracker rates, despite last weeks 0.5% cut in the base rate. Lloyds TSB is hiking its mainstream tracker rates by between 0.3% and 0.5% and Woolwich, the mortgage lending unit of Barclays, is increasing rates on its lifetime and offset tracker deals by 0.2%. Woolwich actually reduced some rates last week on news of the 0.5% fall in the base rate, to 4.5%.
