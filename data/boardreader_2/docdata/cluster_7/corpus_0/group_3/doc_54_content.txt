       Hypermarkets saw their market share drop as supermarkets expanded in the first half of 2008, reports market research institute GfG Hungria. The market share of supermarkets in the daily consumer goods sector grew by 1.8% to 16.6% while hypermarkets shrunk from 24.7% to 23.3%. Meanwhile, the market share of discount chains has not shown considerable change since last year, Hungarian-owned chains such as CBA have seen slight growth, and small, independent stores continued to lose market share.       According to Jnos Kui at GfK, the growth in supermarkets is the result of a large number of new stores opening in Hungary. This is likely to be offset by a fresh round of expansion in the hypermarket segment, which Kui expects to bring a mid-term increase in market share of up to 6%.
