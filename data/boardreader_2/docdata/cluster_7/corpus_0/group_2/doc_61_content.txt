When I added Bank of America (bac) to my long-term portfolio last quarter I had the full intention of holding onto the stock for a long time. However when AIG started to fall hard in the past week I viewed Bank of America as a source of funds. So I booked a solid gain of 45% on BAC and averaged down my position in AIG, which now stands @ $23.92. I continue to believe AIG share price does not fully reflect its true value. Additionally I view AIG as another example of over zealous selling on the part of short-sellers. Even though AIG is going through pain with their mortgage holdings, its current stock price is a steal at current prices.I view AIG as a core long-term hold and with my recent averaging down its it my 3rd largest position in my portfolio.
