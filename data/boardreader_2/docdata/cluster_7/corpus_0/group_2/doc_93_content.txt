 Remember Napster? The file-sharing software developed in a Northeastern University dorm room by Shawn Fanning that once upon a time struck fear in the hearts and minds (and wallets) of record label executives everywhere -- back when record labels actually had money. Although the labels attempted to kill it through litigation -- rather than partnering with it -- like a cat with nine lives, Napster is still in business -- albeit in a very different business model. The company has undergone many transformations since then, eventually going public in January 2005. Now it is looking for a "strategic alternative" (read owner) and has hired UBS to assist in the process. It's the second time UBS has been hired for the identical task; the Swiss bank started an auction in September 2006 that went ultimately nowhere. Will this time be any different? Time will tell, but Napster's brand -- once its chief asset -- has clearly lost a lot of its allure as new rivals (most notably Apple Inc.'s iTunes) entered the market in the decade since its launch. On the other hand, the company appears to have developed a solid (paid) subscription model and last year had over $100 million in revenues.With the hire, UBS keeps pace with J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. in the Auction Block league table. Since our last update, the two firms move into a third place tie with Morgan Stanley. Additionally, Jefferies &amp; Co. moves up as well, into a tie for sixth with Lehman Brothers Inc., which has been in the news for completely different reasons. From what we're hearing, Lehman did not hire anybody to shop its asset management business but is relying on its own bankers to drum up interest -- reportedly from private equity -- so the table does not reflect Lehman's self-run auction. - Nathaniel Baker         Auction Advisers League Table           This Week     Last Week     Firm     Total YTD hires     New clients since last update (target, if different from client)           1     1     Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.     20     &amp;nbsp;           2     2     Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.     11     &amp;nbsp;           3     3     Morgan Stanley     8     &amp;nbsp;           &amp;nbsp;     4     J.P.

Sometimes the phrase "including a sale" or "including a possible sale" is tacked on at the end of the statement. Other times the company is less obvious about its want/need to unload assets. In merger arbitrage land, the news triggers a set of Pavlovian responses, usually taking the form of a series of questions: What company did this? Why? Was it due to activist pressure? Earnings disappointments? A combination? More importantly, should we long this stock? If not, do we get in now? Who might buy? How likely is this to happen? Do we short them? Poor arbs. It is said their lives are nothing but long stretches of boredom interspersed with moments of stark panic. (Or maybe that was pilots?) Private equity firms flush with cash will of course take interest for a different reason -- as a potential bidder for some of the companies' assets, or perhaps even for the companies themselves. Lost in all this is the business done by the advisory firm that was hired to conduct the review. Just who are these guys, and how much business are they doing? This blog series was born of an attempt to answer this question and shed some light on this niche of the investment banking world. The below chart is a stab at putting it all into context. To narrow the scope somewhat, we have limited the data to new auctions announced during the 2008 calendar year. Unlike "traditional" league tables, which usually attempt to track revenues, this table is ordered by the number of new clients signed year-to-date by a particular firm. (Not all companies identify the firm they hired to conduct their review, though The Deal reporters are often able to dig this information up through sources. Still, the table will by definition be incomplete for this reason.)
