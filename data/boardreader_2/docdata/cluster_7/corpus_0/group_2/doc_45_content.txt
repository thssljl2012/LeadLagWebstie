Ten large banks have committed $7 bln each to a loan fund to help struggling financial institutions (WSJ).  One of the contributing financial institutions could apply for a loan of up to one third of the total amount of the pool.The problem with this initiative is that the member banks are unlikely to want to lose money.  They will only lend to borrowers that look like they will be able to repay the loans.  These are unlikely to be the institutions that need capital...Participants include Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS.
