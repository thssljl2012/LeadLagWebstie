The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut its key interest rate for the third month in a row as it attempts to prevent Australia&amp;#8217;s economy stalling. The central bank trimmed three-quarters of a percentage point - or 75 basis points - off its key cash rate, reducing it to 5.25%, the lowest level since December 2003.  For a typical 25-year, $250,000 home loan, today&amp;#8217;s cut if passed on in full by lenders will save the borrower $112.63 a month in payments or some $33,791 over the life of the loan.The move, announced after today&amp;#8217;s monthly board meeting by the RBA, exceeded economists&amp;#8217; predictions of a 50 basis-points cut. Today&amp;#8217;s cut brings the RBA&amp;#8217;s cuts to 2 percentage points since the central bank reversed course in September, retreating from a 12-year high rate of 7.25%.  The RBA will be hoping that the big commercial banks will repeat last month&amp;#8217;s feat of passing on the entire official rate cut to borrowers. Lower lending costs help spur the economy by encouraging more individuals and businesses to purchase houses or make other investments, stoking demand that in turn prompts more orders.  Almost all the latest economic figures point to a sharp slowdown in demand as the effects of the global financial crisis spread to Australia. Falling commodity prices are already dimming the outlook for the mining and export sectors. Retail sales shrank 1.1% last month from September, the largest drop since April 2005, as consumers start to pull back on spending.  House prices, another measure of the economy&amp;#8217;s health, fell 1.8% in the September quarter, the sharpest slowdown since the 1970s, according to some reports.  Housing is becoming more and more attractive as an asset class as the year progresses. Opportunistic investors are in for a feast  especially those from abroad in countries with exchange rate advantages (United States, United Kingdom and the countries of the European Union using the Euro) - exciting times!
