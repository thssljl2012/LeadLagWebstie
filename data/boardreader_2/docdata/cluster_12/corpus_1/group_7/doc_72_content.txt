'Current property market conditions may generate some opportunities for the trust to acquire quality earnings-accretive assets in the near term, as current owners sell assets to manage their capital requirements,' it said.  'However, acquisition opportunities will be considered in the context of prudent capital management, including maintaining an appropriate gearing level.'  The trust's gearing ratio - debt to total assets - at the end of December was 35.5 per cent, within the preferred range of 20 to 40 per cent.  The trust posted a distributable profit of $20.5 million for the six months to December 31, up 3.7 per cent on the previous corresponding period.  Income increased by 10 per cent to $35.1 million due to additional income from investment properties in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland that were acquired last year.  An interim distribution of 6.7 cents per ordinary unit has been declared, up 2.3 per cent on the first half of 2007/08.  Talks are continuing with Commonwealth Bank of Australia to extend a $100 million cash advance facility beyond the current expiry date of January 2010 by one year.  The trust has a total of $380 million in debt facilities with four major Australian banks.  Its total liabilities stood at $393.5 million at the end of December.  Finance costs of $10.7 million were 24.7 per cent higher in the period than prior corresponding period due to an 18 per cent increase in the average level of debt to $312.8 million.  The value of its investment property portfolio fell by $6 million to $956.3 million during the half year.  Total capital expenditure on the portfolio amounted to $37.9 million including the construction of a Bunnings Warehouse at Hawthorn, Victoria at a cost of $24.1 million.  Shares in Bunnings Warehouse Property Trust were up four cents, at $1.59 at 1608 AEDT.
