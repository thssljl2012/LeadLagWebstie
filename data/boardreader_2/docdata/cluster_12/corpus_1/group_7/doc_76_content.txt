SYDNEY, Feb 13 (Reuters) - AMP Ltd, Australia's third-biggest retail fund manager, will cut its final dividend for 2008, citing a need to maintain balance sheet strength in a challenging environment. Ahead of its 2008 results next week, Australia's biggest pension administrator said on Friday it would cut its final dividend to A$0.16 from A$0.24 last year. It expects 2008 profit in line with market expectations. 'We understand the impact a lower-than-expected dividend has on our large shareholder base, particularly when times are tough,' said Craig Dunn, AMP's chief executive, in a statement. 'But as a board we recognise the need to make some tough calls in the short term to ensure the best long term outcomes for the company and our shareholders,' said Dunn. AMP becomes the latest Australian financial firm to warn over dividends, a worry for many investors who have traditionally bought financial companies' shares because of steady, high dividend income. Earlier in the week, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country's third-largest bank, warned that it may cut future dividends due to tough market conditions. AMP said total net cashflows in its AMP Financial Services business for the three months to Dec. 31 were A$252 million ($164.2 million), down from A$524 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. 'The fall reflected much lower discretionary superannuation contributions, in the wake of volatile investment markets and subdued investor sentiment,' the statement said. The company said it expected an underlying profit of about A$800 million, in line with market expectations, down from A$882 million in the previous year when Australian fund managers enjoyed strong inflows and buoyant equity markets. Underlying profit is the earnings base on which the company bases its decisions on dividends. AMP said the company remained strongly capitalised, with excess capital above minimum regulatory requirements at Dec. 31. ($1=1.535 Australian Dollar)
