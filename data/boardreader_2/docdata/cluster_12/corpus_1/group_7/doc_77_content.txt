Fletcher Building turned in net earnings of $172 million profit for the December half, down 27%, on ebit down 23% to $303 million, and the outlook is for an even lower return on the second half.  Chief executive Jonathan Ling said yesterday the company had cut the top of the profit range for the year  forecast at the annual meeting in November - by $18 million to $336 million, but retained $289 million as the bottom of the range. He now expects full-year earnings to come in at the bottom of the range.  The interim result was an odd one  group sales were actually 6% higher, reflecting higher steel prices &amp; volumes, growth in the metal roof tile business, strong demand for concrete pipe products in Australia and record construction activity levels associated with infrastructure projects in New Zealand.  Fletcher Building began paring back staff numbers well before others spotted a recession coming and got numbers down by 1700 in the past year (1100 in the second half of 2008), but still faced lower earnings in most segments of its business through fixed costs, plus the effects of currency changes.  The building products division increased sales from $376 million to $412 million (9.6%), but saw earnings fall $19 million to $55 million (down 25.7%). Distribution (Placemakers) sales fell from $565 million to $481 million (down 14.9%), and earnings fell from $42 million to $18 million (down 57%). Infrastructure sales rose 10.5%, from $921 million to $1.018 billion, but earnings fell 29%, from $145 million to $103 million. Laminates &amp; panels sales were down $5 million to $1.069 billion, while earnings fell 57%, from $91 million to $39 million. Steel was the best performer, riding on the back of a tight international market, increasing sales by 27.2%, from $611 million to $777 million, and doubling earnings from $47 million to $95 million.  Earnings/share fell 27%, from 47c to 34c but the dividend was held at 24c.  The return on average equity peaked at 29.5% in 2005 and had fallen to 19% last year. In the latest half-year it was down to 12.4%. Likewise, the return on average funds peaked at 29.3% in 2005, falling to 19% last year and to 13.1% in the December half. The companys debt ratio was stable, rising from 40.1% in June to 41.3% in December. Interest cover is down from 5.9 times a year ago to 3.8.  The big issue for many Fletcher Building observers is Formica, the $960 million US purchase made in 2007. Buyer &amp; seller are now at each others throats in a US court over non-performance, and the results for Fletcher have certainly been dismal. The ratio of ebitda:sales fell from 7% a year ago to 4.4% in June, 4% in December, and earnings from the US-based business were negligible.  But Mr Ling saw a long-term future for Formica within Fletcher Building. The timing of the acquisition, with the benefit of hindsight, could have been better. But, he said, it fits beautifully with Laminex.  Overall, the outlook is a mixture. Housing &amp; commercial property markets are in decline but Government spending on infrastructure will partly offset that. Nevertheless, Mr Ling said, I have no doubt that trading, through 2009 and possibly into 2010, will remain tough.  He expects significant further declines in market demand: New Zealand is at low levels but it seems to have stabilised. Australia  not sure at the moment. The US is a dramatic fall, probably towards the bottom.  In capital terms, the group has negotiated an extra $A100 million 2-year bilateral facility with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, it raised $131 million in its New Zealand capital notes issue, sold its head office on a sale &amp; leaseback for $36 million, has unutilised facilities of $615 million and needs to refinance $211 million in the next year, including $93 million of notes for resetting &amp; $64 million of expiring undrawn facilities. The average maturity of the $2 billion net debt is 5.4 years.  Mr Lings summary of its financial state: With strong operating cashflow, gearing at 41.3% &amp; interest cover at 3.8 times, the group remains in a sound financial position.  It had a $1.2 billion construction backlog in December, down from $1.3 billion in June, and Mr Ling said the company expected it to stay above $1 billion for some time to come. Provided that backlog is above $600 million, Fletcher Building is in very good space.  Want to comment? Email bobdey@propbd.co.nz.
