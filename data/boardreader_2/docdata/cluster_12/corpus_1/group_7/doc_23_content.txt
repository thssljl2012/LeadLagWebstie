MELBOURNE -(Dow Jones)- Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ.AU) said Thursday that its provisions for bad and doubtful debts for the year to Sept. 30 is likely to rise to A$2.4 billion-A$2.5 billion, in line with current market estimates.  In its first quarter trading update, Australia's fourth largest bank by market captialization said credit provisions for the first four months of the financial year are around A$800 million.  It also said that volatitility in global credit markets continues to impact its credit intermediation trades, with a further mark to market charge of A$370 million taken in the year to date.  ANZ also expects that its dividend this fiscal year will be around 25% lower on the previous year.  Cash earnings in the first four months of the financial year are up 18% on year, excluding provisions and the credit intermediation trades, ANZ said. 'In this environment, our underlying business is travelling well. We are continuing to deal with legacy issues, managing the impact of the financial crisis and implementing our super regional strategy,' Chief Executive Mike Smith said. -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9650-0637; lyndal.mcfarland@ dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-25-091634ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
