A new report by Bank of America and Merril Lynch estimates that the UAE's total debt obligations are $142bn, of which $24bn is due for repayment this year, reported Khaleej Times. The report said UAE's overall level of redemption for 2009, including $15bn for Dubai, 'seemed manageable'. While the national debt dynamics for the UAE and GCC are strong, the report cautioned that lack of clarity on the exact balance sheet positions was a cause of concern.
