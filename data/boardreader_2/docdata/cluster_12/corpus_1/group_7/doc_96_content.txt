Citibank N.A. is hiring more people as they expand Philippine operations this year, country manager Mark Jones said.  Jones, in a statement, said Citibank is hiring at least 1,000 more after increasing their staff by 500 last year. This is in contrast to Citigroup's worldwide laying off of its employees in 2008.  'Citi is repositioning in the Asia Pacific but we remain focused on growth,' Jones said.
