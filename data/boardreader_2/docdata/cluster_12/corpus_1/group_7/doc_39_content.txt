The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has indicated that it will take steps to acquire a new Asian asset. The recent acquisition of BankWest contributed to the CBA's $A2.6bn interim profit for 2008-09. An estimated $A547m of the profit was attributed to the revised value of BankWest as a non-cash gain. CBA CEO, Ralph Norris, has not commented on speculation that his group may buy Suncorp-Metway assets
