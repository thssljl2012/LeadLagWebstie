 local millionaires saw their individual net worth fall below the HK$1 million mark last year as plummeting stock markets took a heavy toll on Hong Kong's wealthy, a Citibank survey has found.  With global financial markets in disarray, the total number of people with more than HK$1 million in liquid assets fell to about 348,000 last year from some 414,000 in 2007.  Significantly, the average wealth of each millionaire dropped by more than a quarter to HK$3.4 million, from HK$4.6 million.  This means their combined wealth shrunk an estimated HK$721.2 billion to more than HK$1.18 trillion last year, from just over HK$1.9 trillion in 2007.  The figures refer to liquid assets like investments and deposits and do not include property.  'Investment performance was the key reason why people's millionaire status changed last year,' Citibank's (Hong Kong) deputy country business manager Simon Chow said.  'Investment gains and losses were cited as the reason [for change of wealth status] by 72 per cent last year compared to 63 per cent in 2007. Nineteen per cent said it was because they bought or sold property last year, up from 15 per cent in 2007.'  Given the emphasis on investments, the survey findings indicated that 60.3 per cent of millionaires suffered stock market losses averaging HK$427,000 each while one-third lost on mutual funds, averaging HK$158,000 each.  Foreign currency losses averaging HK$75,000 were recorded by 18.8 per cent of millionaires.  The number of wealthier millionaires, or those worth HK$5 million or more, suffered a much larger drop than those with HK$1 million or HK$2 million or less, Mr Chow said.  Year on year, the number of people with HK$5 million or more shrunk about 36 cent to about 43,000 from 67,000. Those worth between HK$2 million and HK$5 million fell 10 per cent to 86,000 from 96,000.  Slight increases were recorded for people with less than HK$100,000 and between HK$100,000 and HK$500,000 in liquid assets.  The distribution of millionaires showed that one out of nine people on Hong Kong Island were Hong Kong dollar millionaires last year. This compared to one out of 17 people in Kowloon, and one out of 19 people in the New Territories and outlying islands.  Although three-quarters of the millionaires are not salary earners and are mostly retirees, housewives and business owners, those with jobs expressed confidence in their job situation in the coming six months.
