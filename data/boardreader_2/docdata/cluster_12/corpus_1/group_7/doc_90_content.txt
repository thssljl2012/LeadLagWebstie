ANZ last night ruled out a capital-raising in the near term, declaring its balance sheet was among the strongest of the major Australian banks. Speculation had mounted that ANZ would tap shareholders for extra funds to boost capital ratios.  Commonwealth Bank raised $2 billion before Christmas, while NAB raised $3 billion through a share placement last year. ANZ issued more than $1 billion in convertible preference shares in September, shortly before global market dislocation took hold.  ANZ said its tier-one capital ratio  a measure of balance sheet strength  stood at 8.35 per cent, above regulatory requirements. The tier-one levels of major Australian banks now range between 8 and 8.75 per cent. ANZ will issue a first-quarter trading update for investors on February 26.
