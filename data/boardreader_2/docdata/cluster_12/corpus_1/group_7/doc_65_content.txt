Investors set to learn just how healthy Canada's big banks are        From the beginning, this crisis has been about the health of the banks.  America's biggest institutions left themselves vulnerable to the rot of subprime financial products no one could value or understand. In sharp contrast, Canada's more tightly regulated commercial banks protected themselves by keeping plenty of core capital on hand to mop up losses.  The result has been an astonishing shift in relative financial power across the border.  Consider the scale of the transformation since October 2006, when Bank of America and Citigroup -- then the premier commercial banks in the U.S. -- each enjoyed a market value of roughly $250 billion U.S.  That was more than the combined market capitalization of Canada's six largest banks.  Today, the Royal Bank of Canada alone is worth more than Bank of America. And the shares of TD Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia each carry more value than those of Citigroup.  This stunning turn of fortune raises two questions. Is it real? And should Canada's bankers take advantage?  We'll likely have the answer to the first question this week as four of Canada's six largest banks -- beginning today with TD Bank -- unveil financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31.  The Royal Bank, CIBC and National Bank report on Feb. 26.  It's the first complete snapshot we'll have of how the wider economic crisis has affected the banks' balance sheets. The previous quarter ended just six weeks after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. This was the event that ignited the most virulent phase of the credit crisis.  Last September, there was hope the hurt would be confined to the financial sector but, by December, it was clear the subprime contagion was infecting the the rest of the economy.  Canada's banks revealed a sharp rise in the number of loans giving customers trouble in the fourth quarter. However, the biggest chunk of the lending involved U.S.-based clients.  For instance, Royal Bank reported a near tripling of its impaired loans to $2.9 billion from October 31, 2007 to the end of fiscal 2008.  Not quite $1 billion of this amount was accounted for by Canadian individuals and businesses.  This was up 37 per cent year over year.  The shocker was the near quadrupling of impaired loans among Royal Bank's U.S. customers -- to $1.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2008 compared to $349 million at the start.  Most of the deterioration involved real estate clients.  In all, Royal Bank's impaired loan portfolio represented just one per cent of all loans on its books, but this was up from 0.45 per cent at the end of fiscal 2007.  Royal Bank last quarter set aside about $1.6 billion to cover the loans it thinks it won't be able to make good.  Royal Bank and other members of the group of six established loan loss provisions of $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter.  Michael Goldberg, a Toronto-based analyst with Desjardins Securities reckons the six banks will have to increase this amount by nearly 50 per cent in the current fiscal year as the weaker economy hits home.  Goldberg predicts TD today will report a loan loss provision of $400 million, up nearly 40 per cent from the fourth quarter.
