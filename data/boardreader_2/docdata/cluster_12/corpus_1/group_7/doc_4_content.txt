Of our loan portfolio, greater than 95% of the         investments are in senior secured loans.     --  Received approximately $69.0 million of principal repayments, including         early repayments of approximately $41.0 million; $38.3 million of the         proceeds were used to pay down existing Citibank and Deutsche Bank         borrowings to a balance of $89.6 million at December 31, 2008.     --  Recorded net realized loss of $2.3 million, primarily attributable to         one loan, and net unrealized depreciation of $19.4 million on loans,         warrants and equity investments. Of the unrealized depreciation         approximately $17.0 million was primarily attributable to FAS 157         valuation adjustments to the Company's warrant and equity investments.         Hercules held warrant positions in 92 portfolio companies at the end of         the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to warrants in 82 companies at the         end of the fourth quarter of 2007.     --  Commitments for the fourth quarter were comprised of approximately $57.0         million in debt commitments.     --  Debt funded in the quarter totaled approximately $34.0 million and there         were no equity fundings.     --  Announced a $0.32 dividend per share, our fourteenth consecutive         dividend. This dividend will be paid on March 30, 2009 to shareholders         of record as of February 23, 2009, an increase of 7% over the comparable         period in 2008. The dividend will be payable up to 90% per share in         common stock of Hercules and 10% per share in cash, based on shareholder         elections.   'I am very pleased to report our solid achievements and results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2008, despite the difficult economic times and deteriorating general business and credit environment,' said Manuel A. Henriquez, CEO of Hercules. 'Early in 2008, we announced our 'slow and steady' investment strategy and the shift in our investment focus to more mature later stage companies. These changes were made to manage our credit performance, maintain adequate liquidity and manage our operating expenses in this extremely challenging and unprecedented credit environment. We have also added a Senior Credit Officer who is focused on both the life science and technology portfolio to further assist in mitigating credit loss.' 'Today, we also announced that our Board of Directors declared our fourteenth dividend which will be paid 10% in cash and 90% in stock. The first quarter dividend reflects our continued strong performance and commitment to shareholder value despite current market conditions. We believe the decision to pay the first quarter dividend primarily in stock is a prudent and cautious decision to assist with the preservation of capital and ensure ample liquidity to satisfy our April 30, 2009 maturing Citibank and Deutsche Bank facility. We have been taking, and will continue to take, a conservative approach to strengthen our liquidity position and balance sheet in these unprecedented economic times.' 'Given the increasingly challenging times and the high volatility we witnessed during the fourth quarter, we anticipate that the current macro-economic conditions will likely continue to adversely affect venture capital fundraising activities. We expect a slower rate of new venture capital investments or deployments, which may, accordingly, cause the venture debt market to contract. Even with this anticipated contraction, we estimate venture capital investments for 2009 of approximately $20.0 billion to $22.0 billion. Our addressable market represents 20% to 40% of the annual venture capital deployments, or $4.0 billion to $8.0 billion in 2009. We believe that by continuing to operate conservatively, Hercules will emerge in a favorable market position.' 2008 Highlights:      --  Record revenues of $75.8 million, a 41% increase from $53.9 million in         2007.     --  Record net investment income before taxes of $40.0 million, or $1.23 per         share. In 2007, net investment income for the Company was $32.5 million,         or $1.15 per share, representing an increase of 23% year over year.     --  Net income for 2008 was $21.0 million, or $0.64 per share which includes         approximately $21.4 million in unrealized depreciation in 2008,         primarily attributable to FAS 157 valuation accounting. This compares to         $42.4 million or $1.50 per share in 2007.     --  Taxable income for the year was approximately $40.0 million, or $1.23         per share, based upon 32.6 million weighted average shares outstanding.         This compares to taxable income of approximately $34.0 million, or $1.21         per share, based on 28.3 million weighted shares outstanding in 2007.     --  Total debt commitments were approximately $406.0 million, as compared to         approximately $481.0 million in the year 2007. The decrease in         commitments reflects the slower investment pace we established in the         second half of 2008.     --  Total fundings were approximately $331.0 million for 2008, of which debt         fundings totaled approximately $325.0 million and equity investments         totaled approximately $6.0 million, as compared to approximately $367.0         million of fundings in the prior year, of which, approximately $12.0         million was in equity investments.     --  Total unfunded debt commitments were approximately $82.0 million as of         December 31, 2008.     --  Overall weighted average yield to maturity on the company's loan         portfolio increased to 12.87%, compared to 12.70% in 2007.   Fourth Quarter Review and Operating Results   During the quarter, Hercules entered into commitments to provide debt financing of approximately $57.0 million and funded a total of approximately $34.0 million in debt investments. Hercules made no equity commitments or investments during the fourth quarter of 2008.   Proceeds from principal repayments were $69.0 million, comprised of normal principal repayments, early repayments and pay downs on working capital lines of credit. As a result of the normal and early principal repayments, Hercules decreased its Citibank and Deutsche Bank debt facility by approximately $38.3 million during the quarter to an outstanding balance of $89.6 million at December 31, 2008. This debt facility will continue to amortize until April 30, 2009, when all outstanding principal and interest are due.   During the fourth quarter, Hercules recognized $19.4 million of net unrealized depreciation from its loans, warrant and equity investments. This depreciation consisted of approximately $2.4 million in loan values, $7.3 million in warrant values and $9.7 million in equity values, primarily attributed to the valuation accounting required under FAS 157.   As of December 31, 2008, Hercules had unfunded debt commitments of approximately $82.0 million to 28 portfolio companies. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. In addition, the Company executed a non-binding term sheet for $7.0 million for a proposed future commitment. This proposed investment is subject to completion of the Company's due diligence and final approval process, as well as the negotiation of definitive documentation with the prospective portfolio company. Not all non-binding term sheets are expected to close and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Investment Portfolio   The fair value of Hercules' investment portfolio at quarter-end was $581.3 million as compared to $530.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007.   The fair value of the loan portfolio was $540.1 million compared to a fair value of $482.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2007. The fair value of the equity portfolio was $23.3 million compared to a fair value of $26.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007.   Hercules held warrant positions in 92 portfolio companies, with a fair value of $17.9 million at December 31, 2008, as compared to warrants in 82 portfolio companies with a fair value of $21.6 million at December 31, 2007. If exercised, these warrant holdings at December 31, 2008, would allow Hercules to invest approximately $55.0 million in equity in these portfolio companies. However, t...
