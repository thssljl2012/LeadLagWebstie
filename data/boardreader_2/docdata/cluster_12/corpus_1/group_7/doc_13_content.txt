ANZ says it has no current plans to follow its peers and tap shareholders for money. 'ANZ been made aware of market speculation about a potential capital raising,' the bank said in a statement to the stock exchange last night. 'In response, ANZ can advise its pro-forma 2008 Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 8.35 per cent, substantially above regulatory requirements and among the strongest of the major banks in Australia and globally. There are no current plans for a capital raising.' ANZ is the one major bank not to have carried out an direct institutional placement, but it did raise $1 billion through an underwritten dividend reinvestment plan last year.   The bank has also taken advantage of the government guarantee over its borrowings to raise money in international credit markets.   This week it raised a record Y=180 billion ($3.05 billion) in so-called samuri bonds marketed in Japan. The company said it had now raised 75 per cent of the $21 billion it required by September.   NAB has raised $3 billion from shareholders, Westpac has raised $2.5 billion and the Commonwealth Bank has raised $2 billion.   The troubled Queensland institution Suncorp last week raised $900 million at a 35 per cent discount to its share price.
