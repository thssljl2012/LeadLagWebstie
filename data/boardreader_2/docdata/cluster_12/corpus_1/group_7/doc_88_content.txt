AMP says it is expecting to declare a shareholder dividend below market forecasts and is predicting a fall in its net profit for 2008.  The fund manager will announce its annual results next week and is warning it will cut its final dividend to 16 cents, compared to 24 cents last year.  AMP is the latest Australian financial company to issue a warning about dividends.  Earlier this week the Commonwealth Bank said it may cut future dividends because of tough market conditions.
