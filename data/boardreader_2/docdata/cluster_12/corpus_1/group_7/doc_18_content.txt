SYDNEY, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Macquarie Bank, (News)   Australia's top investment bank, has sold A$1.1 billion ($710.1   million) of five-year bonds backed by the Australian government   to 41 investors, a market source said.   Australian buyers took up 93 percent of the offer, with   Asian investors taking 4 percent and Europeans 3 percent.   More than half landed with banks, with most of the balance   in the hands of fund managers. A small portion was bought by   governments.   Macquarie paid 100 basis points over swap, a fund manager   said, having initiated discussions with investors at a margin of   90 basis points. He said the final price looked fair based on   similar government-backed bonds sold by other local banks.   It was Macquarie's first public foray in Australia under the   guarantee, having previously raised A$10.9 billion, mostly in   U.S. dollars.   Overall, Australia banks have this year sold more than A$58   billion equivalent of funds under a government guarantee put in   place in November to help banks weather the crisis. Most of the   bonds were sold in U.S. and Australian dollars and all rated   triple A by S&amp;P and Moody's.
