ANZ Bank chief executive Mike Smith warned investors today that the group's 2009 dividend could be slashed by as much as 25 per cent even though earnings momentum continued to be strong in its Australian businesses. 'The dividend for 2009 is expected to be reduced by around 25 per cent,'' told an analysts briefing. 'Although this hasn't been an easy decision, because of the importance investors attach to dividends, it is a measured step.''   Mr Smith said ANZ was growing underlying earnings but the bottom-line result this year would be undermined by bad debt charges of up to $2.5 billion.   The bank will book a $130 million provision to cover losses in New Zealand relating to its funds management joint venture with ING. 'In Australia, as anticipated, the slowing economic conditions are flowing through to considerably higher individual and collective provisions principally in consumer finance and Esanda,'' he said. 'Mortgage arrears are tracking up slightly but within expectations.''   The ANZ boss refused to rule out acquisitions in Asia and Australia this year.   Asked whether the bank would lob another bid to buy out beleaguered Queensland financial services company Suncorp Metway, Mr Smith said: 'I'm still very positive about opportunities in Asia. ''In terms of possible opportunities in Australia we will continue to watch and see.''   ANZ scrip opened down 9 cents to $12.41.
