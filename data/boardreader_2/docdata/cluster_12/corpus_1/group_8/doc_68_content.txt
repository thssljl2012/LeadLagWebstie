The bank said that all four hires join from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and will work from Paris.  The three senior corporate finance hires joining the bank are Bruno Hallak and Julien Fabre, who will be senior members in corporate finance client coverage, and Emmanuel Hasbanian, who will be head of mergers and acquisitions for France.  Mr Pandraud will report to Jurgen Fitschen, head of regional management, and he will take over from Jacques-Henri David, the bank's current chief country officer of France, once he arrives in the second quarter of 2009.  Mr Pandraud most recently served as chairman of France at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He joined Merrill Lynch in 1998 from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell where he was co-head of corporate finance in France for three years.  Germany-based Deutsche Bank has appointed Marc Pandraud as the new chief country officer of France. The bank also appointed three senior executives in its corporate finance group within its global banking business.
