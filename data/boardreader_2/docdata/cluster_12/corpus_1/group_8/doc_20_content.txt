The corporate regulator has announced a potential settlement for investors burned in last year's collapse of the Melbourne stock lending firm Opes Prime. The  (ASIC) says it will provide the necessary releases which could deliver $253 million to investors, which represents a return of 40 cents in the dollar.  The proposed settlement is the result of mediation between ASIC, ANZ Bank, Merrill Lynch and the liquidators of Opes Prime.  The potential return, which is based on the value of Opes Prime and potential creditor claims on March 27 last year when the firm went into administration, is subject to credit and court approval.  About 1,200 clients of Opes Prime lost most of their investments when the ANZ called in $650 million in loans after the lending firm went broke at the height of the credit crisis.  In a statement issued today, ASIC said the proposed settlement was to avoid years of costly legal action. 'ASIC's major objective in encouraging the mediation was to recover compensation for investors without the need for costly litigation and multiple actions,' the statement said.  Under the terms of the mediated settlement, ASIC has agreed not to pursue these actions against ANZ and Merrill Lynch relating to breaches of corporations law.  ASIC has also announced it has received an enforceable undertaking from the ANZ in relation to ASIC's investigation into ANZ Custodial Services.  ASIC says the ANZ will be required to 'remedy deficiencies in operational procedures' across the ANZ Custodian Services business, including its securities lending operations.
