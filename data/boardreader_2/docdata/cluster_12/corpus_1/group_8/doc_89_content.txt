BEIJING -(Dow Jones)-  (BAC) said Tuesday it has no plan for now to further reduce its holding in China Construction Bank Corp. (0939.HK) , but can't rule out the possibility of doing so in the future.  The comment came after Guo Shuqing, chairman of CCB, said earlier Tuesday that Bank of America may further reduce its stake in the Chinese lender as a lockup period on part of its holding has expired, but a sale is unlikely to happen ' soon.' Asked to comment on this,   Robert Stickler  , a spokesman for the U.S. bank, said in a statement emailed to Dow Jones Newswires that his bank has no current plans to sell further CCB shares but he 'cannot predict whether or when that stance could change'. Stickle said: 'Even were we to sell some shares in the future, Bank of America intends to continue to be a major shareholder and strategic partner of CCB going forward.' CCB's Guo said earlier Bank of America could sell a stake of up to 5.78% in CCB, based on the shares owned by the U.S. lender that aren't now covered by a lock-up period.  In January, Bank of America sold 5.6 billion of the Chinese bank's Hong Kong- listed shares for $2.8 billion, cutting its stake to 16.6% from 19.1%. -Victoria Ruan  and Liu Li contributed to this story, Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588 5848; victoria.ruan@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 03-10-091002ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
