- 12:34PM ANZ Bank and investment bank Merrill Lynch are nearing a $253 million settlement over the collapse of broker Opes Prime.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a statement today that it was holding fire on taking action against ANZ and Merrill Lynch pending the approval of the proposed settlement with other Opes Prime creditors.  Based on estimates provided by Opes Prime's liquidator, the settlement is expected to deliver a sum of $253 million and a return of about 40 cents in the dollar to creditors of Opes Prime, which includes investors, ASIC said.  The return is based on the value of potential creditors claims as at March 27, 2008 when Opes Prime went into administration, it said.  Opes Prime collapsed in 2008 as the global credit crunch pressured banks to recoup their loans, which the brokerage used to fund its margin lending operation.  Lenders ANZ and Merrill were hit with a class-action suit by Opes Prime clients alleging that they knowingly were involved in misleading conduct by Opes.  ANZ and Merrill deny the claims.  The settlement require approval by creditors and the court. Day, with wires Source:  Story Tools         Feed  Got news tips for us?
