CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 5 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- FairPoint Communications, Inc. ('FairPoint' or the 'Company'), a leading provider of communications services to communities across the country, today announced its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2008. FairPoint completed its acquisition of Verizon Communication's wireline and related operations in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont (the 'Northern New England business') on March 31, 2008. As a result of that transaction, which was treated as a 'reverse acquisition' for accounting purposes, the financial statements for all periods prior to March 31, 2008 reflect the operating results and assets and liabilities of the Northern New England business only. For purposes of analysis, certain financial information for periods prior to March 31, 2008 is presented on a pro forma basis, assuming the acquisition and related transactions had occurred on January 1, 2007.  Highlights  'Last year was truly a year of historic change for FairPoint,' stated Gene Johnson, Chairman and CEO of FairPoint. 'We increased in size by fivefold with the completion of the acquisition of the Northern New England business; we enhanced and strengthened our leadership team for the opportunities that lie ahead; we made great strides in integrating and stabilizing the northern New England operations and we completed the development of a new fully integrated, state-of-the-art platform of systems which became operational on February 9th,' Johnson continued. 'Our cutover to the FairPoint systems was another tremendous milestone and our new systems represent a unique and valuable asset which will enable us to grow the business and improve our operating efficiency.'  'Looking ahead, we remain extremely confident in the growth potential for the Company. Given the very difficult economic and financial market conditions, the Board's dividend action represents a prudent step to preserve capital and improve our leverage profile. We will consider an appropriate dividend payout once the financial markets and the economy improve and our leverage has been reduced. We are extremely excited about the prospects for the Company and we look forward to 2009 and the opportunities that lie ahead,' concluded Johnson.  Fourth Quarter Results  Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $319.3 million, compared with $328.3 million for the third quarter of 2008 and pro forma revenue of $360.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Revenue declined 2.7% compared to the third quarter of 2008 or 3.5% after normalizing for certain prior period adjustments. This decline was driven primarily by a decrease in access line equivalents of 2.7% during the quarter, the effects of seasonality in our northern New England properties, and the rapidly weakening economy.  Adjusted EBITDA was $137.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008, compared with $148.6 million for the third quarter of 2008 and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of $108.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2008 primarily reflects the reduced level of revenue.  The Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 45.3% in the third quarter of 2008 and 31.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in the Adjusted EBITDA margin compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 reflects primarily the elimination of the Verizon cost structure supporting the Northern New England business following the closing of the acquisition on March 31, 2008. These cost savings have offset declining revenue, resulting in an overall margin improvement.  Operating Metrics  During the fourth quarter of 2008, the northern New England operations experienced a 2.7% decline in access line equivalents compared with a 3.1% decline in the third quarter, while Legacy FairPoint access line equivalents declined by 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared with a decrease of 1.5% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by the weaker economic environment and seasonal disconnects which affected both the northern New England and Legacy FairPoint operations.  Total access line equivalents were 1,721,709 at December 31, 2008 compared with 1,906,748 at December 31, 2007, a decline of 9.7%. During the fourth quarter, total access line equivalents declined by 2.7% compared with a decline of 2.8% during the third quarter of this year.  During the fourth quarter of 2008, HSD subscribers in the northern New England operations increased by 0.7% compared with a decline of 0.8% during the third quarter of this year. The northern New England operations continued to experience modest increases in HSD subscribers in Maine and Vermont during the fourth quarter, while HSD subscribers in Legacy FairPoint remained essentially flat during the quarter.  Total combined HSD subscribers increased during the fourth quarter, the first net quarterly increase since the closing of the acquisition in March of 2008. HSD subscribers totaled 295,360 as of December 31, 2008, an increase of 0.4% compared with 294,134 at September 30, 2008 and 1.6% compared with 290,577 at December 31, 2007. HSD penetration was 20.7% as of December 31, 2008, compared with 19.9% at September 30, 2008 and 18.0% at December 31, 2007.  Long distance subscribers totaled 631,458 at the end of December 2008, down 1.9% from 643,844 as of September 30, 2008 and 8.5% below the prior year. Long distance penetration was 44.3% at December 31, 2008, compared with 43.7% as of September 30, 2008 and 42.7% a year ago.

The cutover process extended for nine days and FairPoint began to independently operate its new systems on February 9, 2009. The Company is now working in the post-cutover stage, processing both current orders as well as those that were received during the nine day cutover process. FairPoint, together with Capgemini U.S. LLC, are working diligently to reduce the customer service representatives' average handle time for orders, increase order flow through to provisioning, and return bill cycles to the pre-cutover schedules. We anticipate that all operations will be returned to a normal schedule by the end of the second quarter.  The new systems will enable FairPoint to offer new products and services, including customized bundles, as well as business services that leverage the Company's new MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) data network which is under construction.  Cash Flow and Liquidity  Cash flow from operations totaled $57.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, while capital expenditures, including approximately $100 million associated with the continued development of the Company's new platform of fully integrated, state-of-the-art systems in the northern New England states, totaled $297.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008.  In the fourth quarter of 2008, operating cash flow of $21.3 million was reduced by payments totaling $49.6 million related to the Transition Services Agreement with Verizon and costs related to the systems cutover activities totaling $26.9 million. Normalizing for these non-recurring payments, net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2008 would have been $97.8 million.  On January 21, 2009, FairPoint executed an amendment to its Credit Agreement pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A. was appointed as administrative agent replacing Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. In addition, among other things, the amendment clarifies that FairPoint may increase the annual dividend back to $1.03 per share, subject to certain conditions. The amendment also permits the repurchase of FairPoint's 13-1/8% senior notes due 2018, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with its tax sharing agreement with Verizon Communications Inc.  On January 30, 2009, the Company entered into an agreement (the 'Transition Agreement') with Verizon providing for the acceleration of $30.0 million of payments that could have been owed to FairPoint, pursuant to regulatory orders, based on access line losses during the first two years following the March 31, 2008 acquisition ($15 million of which would have been due on March 31, 2009 with the remaining $15 million potentially due on March 31, 2010). Verizon also waived any potential refund of these amounts and agreed to provide credits totaling $7.7 million against amounts owed by FairPoin...
