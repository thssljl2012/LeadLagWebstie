Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is pressuring banks to lower their fees after a report found Australians are being overcharged in the midst of the global economic crisis.  The report by Fujistu Consulting, first reported yesterday on ABC Radio's AM and ABC News Online, found Australian bank fees were 22 per cent higher than those in Britain and 11 per cent more than US banks.  Speaking this morning, Mr Rudd confirmed he had highlighted his concerns about high fees in recent talks with banking executives.  'The Treasurer and I have met again with the banks in recent weeks and we have raised expressly the question of bank fees and charges,' Mr Rudd said in a radio interview.  'We will continue on this because everyone out there... is facing a really tough time and we don't want to see anyone adding to this burden by unnecessary charges.'  The Fujitsu report said Australian banks were charging higher than average fees due to weaker competition in the sector as smaller banks fell victim to the global economic crisis.  The report claimed the big four banks - Westpac, National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank and ANZ - will charge more than $5 billion in fees this year.  Mr Rudd's concerns come after the Federal Government last year guaranteed deposits and underwrote the wholesale funding of banks.
