GUERNSEY, Channel Islands--(Business Wire)-- Conversus Capital, L.P. (Euronext Amsterdam: CCAP) ('Conversus'), a permanent capital vehicle providing its unit holders long-term capital appreciation through a high-quality, seasoned portfolio of private equity interests, today reported its estimated net asset value ('NAV') as of February 28, 2009.   As of February 28, 2009, Conversus had an estimated NAV per unit of $21.42 reflecting a decrease of 1.6% since January 31, 2009. In evaluating financial performance, Conversus also calculates an 'adjusted NAV' which represents the NAV from operations. The adjusted NAV adds back unit holder distributions and net share repurchases since inception. On an adjusted basis, estimated NAV per unit was $21.85 as of February 28 representing a decrease of 1.7% from the January 31 adjusted NAV per unit of $22.22. Funded assets were $1,779.5 million while unfunded commitments were $812.0 million as of February 28.   As reported on January 12, 2009, in calculating the December 31, 2008 estimated NAV, Conversus applied discretionary write-downs to the private holdings in its portfolio. These write-downs were taken to reflect Conversus' best estimate of the portfolio company valuations as of December 31 based upon the most current information available to Conversus.   The discretionary adjustments taken at the fund level are being replaced with updated valuations as they are received from the general partners of the underlying funds. A final December 31, 2008 estimated NAV will be issued in Conversus' annual financial report to be filed on or before April 30, 2009. The updated NAV estimate will reflect the financial information provided by the general partners for the period ended December 31, to the extent available, as well as other information deemed reliable and relevant to the valuations. Conversus expects the revised NAV to be a more current and accurate reflection of the estimated portfolio value as of December 31, and the updated NAV could vary significantly from the amount previously reported.   'Overall activity levels in both capital calls and distributions continued to slow in February, although Conversus' mature, diversified portfolio was slightly cash flow positive during the month,' commented Bob Long, President and CEO of Conversus Asset Management, LLC. 'In this increasingly difficult environment, we are focused on maintaining our financial flexibility to navigate through any further downturn. We look forward to discussing our thoughts on the market and our investment strategy in more detail in April when we announce our final results as of and through December 31, 2008.'   Realized gains were $0.8 million in February while unrealized losses in Conversus' private holdings totaled $11.4 million. The unrealized losses reflected the replacement of a portion of the discretionary adjustments taken in December with valuations supplied by general partners as of December 31.   The public equity securities in Conversus' portfolio experienced unrealized losses of $14.8 million. In addition, Conversus recorded an unrealized gain of $5.1 million relating to the $75.0 million notional swap which hedges a portion of the public equity exposure in its portfolio. The total unrealized gain on the swap was $32.4 million as of the end of February.   Unrealized currency losses totaled $0.9 million in Conversus' private holdings and $0.6 million in its public equity securities.   As of February 28, 2009, 66% of the investment NAV was comprised of private holdings valued as of December 31 based upon Conversus' estimates and 17% was comprised of private holdings valued based on general partner statements as of December 31. A further 13% of the investment NAV was comprised of public equity securities which were marked to market as of February 28 as further described below in Valuation and Reporting Policies. The remaining 4% of the investment NAV represented cash and other net assets held by the funds in which Conversus is invested.
