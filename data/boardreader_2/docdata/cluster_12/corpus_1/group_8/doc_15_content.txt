SYDNEY, March 6 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group , and investment bank Merrill Lynch are nearing a A$253 million ($162 million) settlement over the collapse of Australian broker Opes Prime, a regulator mediating in the matter said on Friday.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a statement that it was holding fire on taking action against ANZ and Merrill Lynch pending the approval of the proposed settlement with other Opes Prime creditors. Opes Prime collapsed in 2008 as the global credit crunch pressured banks to recoup their loans, which the brokerage used to fund its margin lending operation.  Lenders ANZ and Merrill were hit with a class-action suit by Opes Prime clients alleging that they knowingly were involved in misleading conduct by Opes.  ANZ and Merrill deny the claims.
