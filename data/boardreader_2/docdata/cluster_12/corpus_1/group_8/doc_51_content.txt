Bank investors would take alot of heart from the strong showing by bank stocks today, following on Friday's strong close. Better news from the US from Citi and Bank America reverberated to the local big four bank stocks. ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac posted strong gains. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto had off days, following the price of oil down.   Strength and investor interest in bank stocks was despite recent news that ANZ and NAB would cut interim dividends by 25 per cent. In perspective, even with cuts in bank dividends, yields from bank stocks are far greater for investors than in bank deposit bearing accounts, allowing for a risk factor.   Investors will be watching Wall Street intently again overnight to see whether the US mart can follow the best week's gains in the US stockmarket since November.
