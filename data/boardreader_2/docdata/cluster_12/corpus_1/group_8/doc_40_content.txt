, Australia's largest lender, on Thursday became the second Australian bank to announce a dividend cut, saying it would reduce its first-half payout by about 25 percent.   NAB revealed the news in a strategy update, which put as its top priority the need to maintain a strong capital base amid the challenges of a domestic economic slowdown and global recession.   The bank also said its main focus would continue to be the domestic market but it remained committed to its UK businesses. 'The environment we are in is changing fast,' Chief Executive Cameron Clyne said in the strategy update. 'The world is moving into a recessionary cycle at a speed that was not anticipated six months ago. There is great uncertainty around the timing and speed of an eventual recovery.' NAB's dividend cut follows a move in February by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, the fourth-largest Australian lender, to cut its payout.  That was the first major dividend cut by a major Australian bank since the early 1990s.   There has also been speculation that NAB could be looking to sell its British banks amid investor unhappiness about lower returns from the businesses, Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks.
