MELBOURNE -(Dow Jones)- Australian &amp; New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said Wednesday that its Esanda finance unit will be absorbed into the lender's general company structure in the next three months.  Esanda's earnings and balance sheet are already consolidated with the Sydney- based lender's for reporting purposes, it said in a statement.  The transition will involve the launch of a term deposit, supported by a government guarantee, and Esanda will cease issuing new debentures.  Esanda's existing debentures aren't affected and their existing terms and conditions will continue until maturity, when investors will be offered the opportunity to rollover their investments into term deposit, ANZ said.   -By   Andrew Harrison  , Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4323; andrew.harrison@ dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires 03-17-091823ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
