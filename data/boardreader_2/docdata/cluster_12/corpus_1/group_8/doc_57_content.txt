Fagg is currently deputy CEO at the New Zealand unit and head of retail distribution, the bank said in a statement today. Her previous roles include Managing director for consumer finance at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group across the Tasman.   Hodges, who has led ANZ National since late 2005, will be responsible for the wider groups operational performance and managing key client relationships in his new role in Melbourne, the bank said. Fagg will become a member of ANZ Nationals management board. The changes will take effect on May 1, ANZ National chairman, Sir Dryden Spring, said.  He said Hodges will leave ANZ National in a profitable and well-capitalised position with a strong balance sheet, and well placed to navigate through todays difficult economic environment. Earlier this month, the lender forecast profit will fall this year as the prolonged recession squeezes borrowers and boosts credit provisions.   Earnings declined 32% to NZ$210 million for the three months ended Dec. 31 as it took a credit impairment charge of NZ$94 million, up from NZ$32 million a year earlier. Full-year provisions may double to NZ$572 million, it said.
