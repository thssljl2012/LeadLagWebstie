Papua New Guinea police have arrested 104 illegal Chinese workers after immigration and labour raids at the controversial Ramu nickel mine.  The swoop at the mine in Madang Province, on the PNG north-western coast, resulted in 41 Chinese nationals being held Wednesday on top of 63 charged earlier this week.  China's state-owned Metallurgical Construction Company has repeatedly denied using illegal workers amid allegations that hundreds of their workers don't have appropriate documents.  PNG's Post-Courier newspaper says the country's deputy prime minister and mining minister Puka Temu and Madang governor Arnold Amet have asked the mine project's boss for an explanation.  In August, three Chinese mine workers were attacked by 100 armed local landowners.  There are also environmental concerns as it is feared the mine will pump 100-million tonnes of waste slurry into the province's pristine Astrolabe Bay over the next 20 years.  The PNG government has been accused of breaking the country's own laws by allowing mining construction to go ahead, despite ongoing disputes between landowners about who has traditional ownership of the site.  Locals claim they were never consulted about the project and have been left out of royalty deals.   2008 AAP  Brought to you by  When news happens:send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us.  10:20AM African, Asian join library of genomics  10:20AM Fijians look for quick recovery  10:05AM CBA confirms $170m exposure to Allco
