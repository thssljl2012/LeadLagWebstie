Two property trusts associated with failed financier Allco Finance Group Ltd say they remain 'going concerns' despite the troubles of their parent and manager.  But the two trusts, Rubicon America Trust (RAML) and Rubicon Japan Trust (RJT), have outlined how they see the decision by AFG to go into voluntary administration affecting their operations.  Rubicon America Trust said on Friday that the AFG administration, and a subsequent decision by its direct parent, AFG subsidiary Rubicon Holdings Australia Ltd (RHAL) that it was no longer a going concern, could give rise to a default under two of debt facilities totalling $US84 million.  The issue was arguable, however, and Rubicon America was taking steps to clarify the situation, including seeking waivers from its lenders.  Rubicon Japan Trust said the receivership amounted to a 'review event' which would spark a 30 day discussion period with its banker, National Australia Bank.  Both Rubicon America and Rubicon Japan also said they could be affected if AFG's administrators decided to cut staff, because the trusts are managed by an AFG team.  In this case, the trusts said it was 'possible' that key AFG executives could be re-employed by certain Rubicon entities to provide services to Rubicon America and Rubicon Japan.
