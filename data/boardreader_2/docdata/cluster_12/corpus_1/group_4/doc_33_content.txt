Developer and investor Mirvac Group has completed a $417 million institutional capital raising, with another $83 million to come through a retail offering.  Mirvac said on Thursday it had raised $72 million through an institutional placement and approximately $345 million through the institutional component of an accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer.  With a subsequent retail offer worth $83 million still to come, the developer said it planned to raise $500 million through the exercise.  The Institutional Entitlement Offer and Retail Entitlement Offer are being conducted on a 0.417 for 1 basis at $A0.90 per stapled security at a record date of 1900 AEDT Wednesday, November 5.  Mirvac says the proceeds will be used to strengthen its balance sheet and 'position the Group to flexibly respond to changing market conditions'.  Mirvac managing director, Nicholas Collishaw, described the response to the offer from both existing and new investors as 'very strong'.  'The support of investors demonstrates the continued confidence in Mirvac's stated focus on investing in Australian investment grade properties and delivering pre-eminent Australian residential developments,' he said.  The retail component of the offer opens on Thursday.  The capital raising was announced on Wednesday.  Mirvac said it expected its securities, placed in a trading halt Wednesday, to resume trading Thursday.   2008 AAP  Brought to you by  When news happens:send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us.  10:20AM African, Asian join library of genomics  10:20AM Fijians look for quick recovery  10:05AM CBA confirms $170m exposure to Allco
