THE receivers of ABC Learning Centres are still trying to work out how much cash will need to be injected into the business to ensure the doors of centres remain open, and the figure is likely to reach into the hundreds of millions.  The syndicate of banks that has lent the company an estimated $1.1billion is likely to be tapped for further funds in the short term, to increase the hundreds of millions of dollars pledged by the Federal Government yesterday.  The banks, which include the big four as well as a handful of international banks, were yesterday keen to ensure they were not seen as putting their financial interests ahead of those young families who remain totally dependent on ABC's services.  ABC's board called in the Ferrier Hodgson partner Peter Walker yesterday to take over the reins of the empire, which was once worth more than $4billion, after deciding that the business was either already insolvent or was likely to become insolvent if it continued trading.  Chris Honey of the receivers McGrathNicol, who was also appointed yesterday, refused to rule out closing some centres that had been trading at a loss, and declined to comment on suggestions that his firm had threatened to close some centres if the government did not contribute enough cash.  'At this stage I'm not speculating as to the numbers,' he said, asked how much was needed to keep them operating.  The most likely outcome for the 1200 centres in Australia and New Zealand is their sale to rival operators, but this will not be possible until a wide-ranging review of the business is completed, which could take a year.  The sale process will also take longer than hoped because the centres will have to be sold off in small parcels as there are no buyers with the financial muscle to buy all centres in one line, given the current economic climate.  While McGrathNicol will run the business day-to-day, the first task of the administrators Ferrier Hodgson will be to see if the company can be saved and then to examine whether former or current directors can be sued.  Creditors can expect to hear Mr Walker's preliminary view of the state of the company at a meeting expected to be held on November 18.  Shareholders are unlikely to receive any payment for their holdings in the company.  Mr Honey said his firm had received several inquiries from buyers interested in ABC's assets, but he was not yet prepared to consider offers.  The banks are first in line to claw back their loans. The largest lender, Commonwealth Bank, is owed $630million.  ANZ said yesterday that it was owed $182million, Westpac said it was owed $200million, and National Australia Bank said it was owed $140million.  Mr Honey said he did not know where the ABC chairman, David Ryan, was yesterday, but Mr Ryan said in a statement that he was 'disappointed to be in this position'.  ABC shares have been in freefall since new accounting methods revealed just how badly their core Australian childcare centres were performing.  The banks have been supporting the company since it plunged into crisis in February when it announced its half-year earnings had fallen 42 per cent after hefty property developer payments were stripped out of its accounts on the orders of its new auditors.
