ST GEORGE shareholders have approved the takeover of the bank by Westpac.  The vote was carried out at an extraordinary general meeting held in Sydney today. The offer was already recommended by St George directors.  More than 94 per cent of St George shareholders voted in favour of the deal, Sky Business reported. 'The Westpac proposal was about bringing together two very successful businesses with iconic brands and complementary cultures and therefore it made great strategic sense,' St George chairman John Curtis said.  Westpac is offering 1.31 of its shares for every St George share. St George shareholders will also receive a special dividend payment.  More to come
