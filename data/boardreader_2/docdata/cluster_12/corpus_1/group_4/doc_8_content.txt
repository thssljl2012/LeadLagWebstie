(AsiaPulse via COMTEX) -- NAB   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- CFK Childcare Centres Ltd (ASX:CFK) was placed in receivership on Wednesday after going into voluntary administration the day before due to a failed asset sell-off to ABC Learning Centres Ltd.  Ferrier Hodgson partners Max Donnelly and Steve Sherman were appointed receivers and managers of CFK's assets by the secured creditor, which is understood to either Macquarie Group or National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX:NAB).  CFK's board appointed BDO Kendalls as voluntary administrators on Tuesday and revealed the company was losing more than $A400,000 ($US260,840) a month.  CFK said it had been unable to complete an $8.5 million sale of childcare centres to the debt-laden ABC Learning.  The failure of the deal with ABC Learning (ASX:ABS), which is in administration and receivership, meant CFK had not met one of the preconditions to any standstill arrangement with its banker NAB, and therefore could not complete its 2008 financial report.  'The operations of CFK are continuing and the receivers will be working with key stakeholders to ensure as best as possible that the CFK centres remain open,' Ferrier Hodgson said in a statement on Wednesday.  'With the ongoing assistance of everybody involved with these centres, the receivers are endeavouring to ensure all CFK centres remain open.  'The receivers will be working to provide employees, creditors, families and all other stakeholders with some degree of certainty about the company's future as soon as they have had an opportunity to properly assess its financial situation.'  There are 43 childcare centres in the CFK group, all in New South Wales.  (AAP)  More News:  Market Updates   Stock Alerts   All Trading News   Stock Index
