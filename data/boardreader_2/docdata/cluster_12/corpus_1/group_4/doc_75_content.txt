 National Australia Bank Limited (NAB) today announced further details of its Share Purchase Plan (SPP). The SPP will provide eligible shareholders with the opportunity to subscribe for up to A$10,000 of new fully paid ordinary shares in NAB (NAB Shares) without incurring brokerage or other transaction costs.  The offer price for each NAB Share under the SPP will be the lower of:  - A$20.00, being the price at which NAB Shares were issued to institutional investors under the recent institutional placement; and  - the volume-weighted average price of NAB Shares traded in the ordinary course on ASX during the 5 trading days up to, and including, the day on which the SPP offer is scheduled to close (Friday, 12 December 2008), rounded down to the nearest cent.  Therefore, the maximum price that shareholders eligible to participate in the SPP will pay is A$20.00 per NAB Share.  The offer will be open to eligible shareholders, that is shareholders who were registered holders of NAB shares (or persons expressly recorded on the NAB share register as a beneficiary where shares are held by a trustee or nominee) at 7.00 pm (AEDT) on Thursday, 13 November 2008 (the Record Date) with a registered address in Australia or New Zealand and who are not acting for the account or benefit of U.S. persons. It is not possible for holders of NAB Shares with registered addresses in other jurisdictions to participate in the SPP.
