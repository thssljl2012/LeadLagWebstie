Commonwealth Bank of Australia plans to raise up to A$750 million (US$493 million) in new shares to bolster its balance sheet, its second call on shareholders in as many months as the global downturn hits home.   Wednesday's move by Australia's third-largest bank brings the total raised by the three biggest local lenders to around $5.4 billion, including Commonwealth's $1.3 billion issue in October.   CBA, which followed a $1.6 billion share issue by Westpac on Tuesday, said it would use the new proceeds to buy back a form of low-ranking debt, known as hybrid debt, which is no longer in demand by fixed-interest investors.   More From CNBC.com ... 'Given uncertain equity market conditions we consider it prudent to do this now,' said CBA Chief Financial Officer David Craig in a statement.   CBA is placing the latest new share issue with investment bank Merrill Lynch and will use the proceeds to redeem its hybrid PERLS II securities in March 2009.   On Tuesday, Westpac, Australia's second-largest lender, seized on a recent rally in financial stocks to beef up its balance sheet following its takeover of St George Bank. It too noted difficulties in raising funds through hybrid debt.   Last month, top lender National Australia Bank raised about $1.97 billion in a share placement, and in October CBA issued new shares to fund its acquisition of BankWest from struggling British bank HBOS.   At CBA's annual meeting last month, the bank said it expected higher bad loan provisions in the first half and remained cautious on the economic outlook for at least 18 months.
