Westpac Banking Corporation said it was launching a $2.5 billion underwritten share placement to boost its balance sheet following the acquisition of St George Bank.  The bank said the placement would be fully underwritten by JP Morgan, UBS, and Morgan Stanley and would be in the form of an offer to institutions.  The bank said its shares would be on a tarding halt, which was likely to remain until December 10.
