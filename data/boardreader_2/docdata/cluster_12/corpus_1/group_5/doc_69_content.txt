- 1:23 pm TORONTO - There were no big surprises from The Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) Friday as Canada's biggest bank reported quarterly profits fell 15 per cent from a year ago to $1.12 billion on expected charges related to the downturn in global markets.  Royal's earnings amounted to 81 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, and compared with earnings of $1.32 billion or $1.01 per share in the year-earlier period.  The quarter's results included writedowns of $605 million, or $257 million after tax, from its capital markets division, which the bank had warned about last month.  Revenue fell 10 per cent to $5.07 billion from $5.62 billion.  Canadian banking division profits were $676 million, down 15 per cent from $797 million in the year-ago period, while its revenues slid five per cent to $2.4 billion from $2.6 billion.  The international banking unit was hardest hit during the quarter, posting a net loss of $206 million versus a profit of $21 million in the same period last year, as revenues rose four per cent to $17 million. The decline was primarily due to a loss of $244 million in investment portfolios and significantly higher provisions for credit losses.  Wealth management results fell 36 per cent to $116 million from $180 million, as revenues rose four per cent to $39 million. 'I thought the Canadian banking results - of no surprise - were healthy,' said Craig Fehr, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. 'That's going to be a core foundation for earnings for RBC' in the future. Full-year profit was $4.56 billion or $3.38 per share. That was down 17 per cent from $5.49 billion or $4.19 per share in 2007. Annual revenue declined four per cent to $21.58 billion from $22.46 billion.  The year's return on equity was 18 per cent, compared with 2007's bonanza level of 24.6 per cent. The Royal said it ended the financial year with a Tier 1 capital ratio of nine per cent.  The full-year included writedowns totalling $2.79 billion, or $1.42 billion after tax and compensation adjustments, and higher provisions for credit losses primarily in the Royal's U.S. banking business.  This was partly offset by after-tax gains of $533 million on adjustments of debt values, and a $252-million after-tax reduction of provisions set aside for Enron-related litigation.  RBC chief executive Gordon Nixon observed that volatility in financial markets and a weakening global economy resulted in a challenging year for banks worldwide. 'Never has it been more important for us to focus on the fundmentals of our business,' he said during a conference call. 'I am firmly convinced that our relative strength in earnings performance is a direct result of us following a disciplined strategy, adhering to sound risk management practices, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and ensuring our business mix is well diversified.' Shares in the bank were down 52 cents to $36.65 Friday afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
