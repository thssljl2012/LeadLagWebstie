SYDNEY, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd   (CBA), will buy up to A$4 billion ($2.7 billion) of   mortgages from local finance firm Wizard, CBA said on Wednesday,   further boosting its market share in a consolidating Australian   home loan market.   CBA, the nation's third-biggest lender, pipped rival National   Australia Bank Ltd to buy Wizard's loans. Wizard's brand   and distribution business will be bought by mortgage broker   Aussie Home Loans, one-third owned by CBA, for an undisclosed   amount, Aussie Home Loans said in a statement on Wednesday.   Wizard, owned by General Electric Co, becomes the   latest non-bank lender to exit Australia's A$985 billion ($670   billion) home loan market as the global credit crisis pushes up   funding costs.   The changes have concentrated the market in the hands of top   banks.   CBA did not disclose the acquisition price. It said the   purchase of the prime mortgages will have little impact on its   Tier 1 capital ratio.   NAB said in separate release on Wednesday that it had ended   talks to buy Wizard after its offer was not accepted.   Wizard Home Loans was acquired by General Electric in 2004   for about A$500 million.   The Wizard loans are all insured by mortgage insurance   companies and have a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90 percent.   Last year, Westpac Banking Corp acquired the   struggling non-bank lender RHG Group Ltd's brand and   distribution network.
