NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - New York state on Monday said it simplified the forms it uses for bond underwriters as a way to encourage more women- and minority-owned companies to serve on syndicates that sell state debt.   The global credit crunch already has opened the door to regional and women- and minority owned brokerages by claiming several top underwriters, including Merrill Lynch, which merged with Bank of America. And other companies, such as UBS, have curtailed underwriting. 'Of the $22 billion in state bonds sold since 2004, only four percent of the transactions were managed or co-senior managed by Minority/Women Business Enterprise firms,' the state said in a statement.   By cutting the number of tiers, or levels of underwriters in syndicates, the state aims to help more companies 'grow' into the senior, and most lucrative spots.   New York, one of the country's biggest issuers of muni bonds, adopted the forms at the recommendation of the Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Task Force. Five authorities will use the new forms -- the Dormitory Authority, the Environmental Facilities Corp, the Housing Finance Agency, Empire State Development Corp and the Thruway Authority.   New underwriters also will be chosen more swiftly, as the three- to four-year period now used was shortened to two years.
