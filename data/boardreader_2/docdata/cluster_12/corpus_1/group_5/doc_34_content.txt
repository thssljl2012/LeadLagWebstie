SYDNEY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the nation's third-largest lender by assets, has   launched an issue of A$1.25 billion ($828 million) of three- and   five-year bonds, the bank said on Tuesday.   The issue includes bonds that would be covered by a   government guarantee that came into effect last week.   There will be at least A$750 million of fixed and floating   rate notes due in 2013 at a margin of around 120 basis points   over BBSW and swap, to be issued with the guarantee.   There will also be A$500 million minimum of fixed and   floating rate notes due in 2011 at a margin of around 150 to 160   basis points over BBSW and swap, CBA said. Those bonds will not   be covered by the guarantee.   The bonds are rated AA by S&amp;amp;P and Aa1 by Moody's and triple A by S&amp;amp;P and Moody's. Pricing is expected on Wednesday.   Commonwealth Bank of Australia is also the sole lead manager.   A raft of Australian banks are queuing up to raise funds in   the United States and Europe under the government guarantee,   which is aimed at helping banks raise capital amid the global   financial crisis. Australian &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group, Westpac   Banking Group and Macquarie Bank are each   eyeing the U.S. bond market this week, according to sources,   while National Australia Bank was looking at the euro   market last week.   No Australian bank has yet completed a bond issue guaranteed   by the Australian government. For more, see:.
