Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) will place $750 million of shares with Merrill Lynch and use the proceeds to redeem its PERLS II securities in March 2009.  CBA said the PERLS II hybrid securities may be redeemed for cash on the rollover date of March 16, 2009, and reset terms will not be offered.  The number and price of new shares issued to Merrill Lynch will be based on the daily volume weighted average prices of CBA's shares over a period up to 10 trading days, CBA said in a statement on Tuesday.   The new shares will be issued before the end of January 2009.   The bank may adjust the size of the placement or reduce the pricing period depending on market conditions.  CBA's group chief financial officer David Craig said that given the uncertain equity market conditions the bank considered it prudent to finance the hybrid securities' exchange now.'The upfront financing of the PERLS II exchange provides a simple and efficient redemption process for our PERLS II investors.'CBA flagged the conversion of the hybrids to analysts at a market update on November 13.
