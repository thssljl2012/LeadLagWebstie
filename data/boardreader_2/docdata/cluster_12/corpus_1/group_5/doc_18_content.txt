The line-up of possible buyers includes the CommBank itself which, nonetheless, has been allowed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to proceed with its takeover of the West Australian regional bank because of the dire financial troubles faced by its parent, HBOS.  Both the Commonwealth and ANZ lodged statements of interest with Suncorp about acquiring its retail, business banking and wealth management operations after the Brisbane-based bancassurance group encountered increased difficulties in funding those divisions as a result of the global credit crisis.  ANZ, though, is understood to have been the only one of the big four banks to have submitted a formal bid to Suncorp, although the offer was considered too low by the board. Suncorp subsequently aborted the planned sale after the Federal Government moved to temporarily guarantee the wholesale funding needs of the banking sector.  That has alleviated part of the banks' high financing costs, in particular those smaller institutions such as Suncorp which are able to use the Government's triple-A credit rating to raise money to meet their lending requirements in return for the payment of a multimillion-dollar fee. But such help came too late to maintain the independence of BankWest, which has been controlled by Britain's HBOS for 12 years.
