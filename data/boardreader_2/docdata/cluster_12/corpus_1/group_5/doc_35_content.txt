SYDNEY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the nation's third-largest lender by assets, is eyeing a domestic five-year bond that would be guaranteed by the Australian government, two investors said on Tuesday. Preliminary pricing is seen at 120 basis points over bank bill swap rate, they said. The issue could launch as early as Wednesday. CBA was not immediately available to comment. A raft of Australian banks are queuing up to raise funds in the United States and Europe under a government guarantee programme which came into effect last week aimed at helping banks raise capital amid the global financial crisis. Australian &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group, Westpac Banking Group and Macquarie Bank are each eyeing the U.S. bond market this week, according to sources, while National Australia Bank was looking at the euro market last week. No Australian bank has completed a bond issue guaranteed by the Australian government. For more, see:.
