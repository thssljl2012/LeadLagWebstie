MELBOURNE -(Dow Jones)- Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AU) said Wednesday it will raise up to A$750 million through a placement of shares to Merrill Lynch's Australian office to redeem its PERLS II hybrid securities. 'The upfront financing of the PERLS II exchange provides a simple and efficient redemption process for our PERLS II investors,' Chief Financial Officer David Craig said. 'Given uncertain equity market conditions, we consider it prudent to do this now.' The bank said the new shares will be issued before the end of January, but it will retain the ability to adjust the size of the placement or to reduce the pricing period depending on market conditions. The bank also said it plans to offer a share purchase plan to all shareholders, with final details to be provided at the group's interim result in February. -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9650-0637; lyndal.mcfarland@dowjones.com
