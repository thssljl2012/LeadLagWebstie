MUMBAI/BANGALORE: Satyams precarious liquidity position came under further stress on Thursday with its bankers beginning to freeze the company accounts, following erstwhile chairman B Ramalinga Raju startling admission of fraud.  The banks have also stopped fresh disbursements to Maytas Properties and Maytas Infrastructure  the two other companies controlled by Mr Raju and his family.  Citibank has frozen over 30 operational accounts of Satyam. These are trade receivable accounts, and the aim may be to protect the banks $70-million exposure to the troubled IT major, sources said. Satyams other bankers include ICICI Bank, HSBC, Bank of Baroda and BNP Paribas. Banks now fear similar accounting irregularities by the other group firms too.  While Citibanks exposure was mainly to meet Satyams working capital requirements, sources said the banks move to freeze trade receivable accounts would worsen the companys liquidity situation.  Addressing the media on Thursday evening at Hyderabad, Satyams interim CEO Ram Mynampati said the companys liquidity position was not encouraging and it was looking at trade receivabes as one of the options to ease the crunch.  When contacted, a Citibank official said: We are unable to comment due to client confidentiality. But even as Citi is trying to avert a possible hit, the bank, along with JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch, may have to defend itself against a charge of presenting misleading information to investors during the sponsored ADR in 2005.
