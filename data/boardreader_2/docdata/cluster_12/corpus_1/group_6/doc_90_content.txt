The former chairman, managing director and chief financial officer of embattled Satyam Computer Services were yesterday taken into custody on the orders of an Indian court in southern Hyderabad city.  'They will be taken into police custody for 96 hours,' said VSK Kaumudi, inspector general of police in Hyderabad, citing the court order that ruled on a petition filed by the Andhra Pradesh state police.  Bharat Kumar, a lawyer for the founding Raju brothers and CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, said he would file an appeal.  Satyam, India's No4 software services exporter, has been battling for survival since Ramalinga Raju resigned as chairman earlier this month, revealing profits had been falsified and that US$1 billion (HK$7.8 billion) of cash on the books did not exist.  Yesterday, The Economic Times reported that the new board of Satyam has asked Citigroup and BNP Paribas to help with immediate funding needs.  'We talked to Citibank and BNP Paribas and asked them to understand the situation, provide additional funding and give them [Satyam] more time to repay loans,' Deepak Parekh, a senior banker and newly appointed board member, was quoted as saying.
