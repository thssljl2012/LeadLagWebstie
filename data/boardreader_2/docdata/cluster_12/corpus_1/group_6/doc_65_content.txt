AUSTRALIA'S major banks could have their full-year earnings cut by as much as 10 per cent and bad debts are expected to rise by 76 per cent.  Earnings per share for the Big Four banks could drop by up to 10 per cent this financial year and as much as 11 per cent in fiscal 2010,  said in a client note.   The broker said credit card and other personal lending-related losses, as well as more corporate failures and losses in commercial real estate would affect bank earnings.   The broker, now co-branded after BoA's acquisition of Merrill Lynch last year, predicts ANZ Banking Group's earnings will plunge by 10 per cent in its fiscal 2009 to $1.62 a share.   The ANZ's earnings will fall another 7 per cent in fiscal 2010 because of its heavy exposure to the personal banking sector amid unemployment rising to an expected 7.5 per cent by that time, according to the broker.   National Australia Bank will experience an 8 per cent drop in its fiscal 2009 earnings to $2.32 per share.   Westpac's earnings per share were expected to decline by 6 per cent to $1.77 and Commonwealth Bank of Australia earnings would ease by 1 per cent to $2.88 a share.   The broker's Matthew Davison, Andrew Lyons, and Nicole Mehalski said in a client note that NAB would experience a 9 per cent fall in earnings a share in 2010, Westpac an 11 per cent drop, and CBA a 5 per cent decline.   The analysts predict dividend cuts of 11 per cent for ANZ, 8 per cent for CBA, 5 per cent for NAB and no cut for Westpac for fiscal 2009.   The broker says consumer losses are forecast to rise by 76 per cent in fiscal 2009 and by another 63 per cent in 2010 as bad debts from credit card and personal lending peak and become the key driver of banks' non-housing related bad debts.   A growing list of 167 companies that may not pay back their debt - up from 130 last October - means the banks may take more hits on their aggregate $40 billion exposure to this sector.   BoA Securities-Merrill Lynch says Westpac is its preferred stock, followed by NAB, ANZ and CBA. All four stocks advanced on the local bourse.      said in a client note.
