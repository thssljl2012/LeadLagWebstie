Count said in a statement that earnings per share (EPS) for the 12 months to June 30 would fall 20 per cent because of mark-to-market losses on its holding in Mortgage Choice and other investments.  At the annual general meeting in November, the Sydney-based firm said EPS would fall less than 10 per cent.  At the time, Count was basing its profit forecast on a Mortgage Choice share price of 90 cents. Mortgage Choice shares closed at 76 cents on December 31 and had fallen two cents to 80 cents as of 1121 AEDT on Monday.  Shares in Count fell 3.5 cents, or 3.38 per cent, to $1 as the All Ordinaries index gained 0.64 per cent.  Count is aiming to increase its interest in Mortgage Choice, currently a 15 per cent stake, and aims to takeover the mortgage broker to gain greater access to the home-loan market, and create a more diversified financial advice firm.  Count also said its funds under advice (FUA) fell by 27 per cent during 2008, as clients' investments were hurt by the financial crisis.  Still, the value of the funds, and particularly those directly managed by Count, outdid the 43 per cent slump in the All Ordinaries in 2008.  Count's FUA in preferred platforms declined 24.6 per cent.  Total funds under advise fell to $10.75 billion as of December 31, compared with $14.79 billion a year earlier, the Sydney-based company said in a statement.  That dragged down the total amount count manages, including loans, by 21.6 per cent to $14.44 billion. Loans managed by Count rose 1.7 per cent over 2008 to $3.69 billion.  David McIntyre
