This years ranking was published in the July '07 issue  Research by Terry Baker-Self, Beata Ghavimi &amp; Valentina Lorenzon.  Banks around the world continued to produce record profits and increased profitability for the fourth successive year in 2006, which proved to be a good year for the world economy and a bumper year for banks, with significantly improved growth in all key banking indicators.  The banking bonanza continues as The Bankers Top 1000 World Banks ranking for 2007 shows the overall aggregate level of bank profitability (pre-tax profits to Tier 1 capital) continuing its upward march, reaching a record 23.4%, ahead of last years 22.7% and 2005s 19.9%.  Banks have continued to achieve increasing growth and profitability on the back of a very positive economic environment in both the major advanced economies and key emerging markets, such as China. Fitch Ratings noted that growth in the main developed economies reached 2.9% in 2006, compared with 2.3% in 2005, and the euro area experienced its fastest growth rate for six years as Germanys recovery flourished and US consumer spending continued.  Strong growth  The Bankers 2007 ranking registered strong growth in all areas, particularly profits. Aggregate pre-tax profits for the 2007 Top 1000 rose a stunning 21.9% to reach a mammoth $786.3bn, more than 3.5 times the $222.8bn aggregate profits in our 2002 ranking. This latest surge in profits contrasts with results in last years ranking, which had shown a slower profit growth of 18.6% compared with the two previous boom years, and indicated that the banking party may have been drawing to a close.  But the slowdown did not continue and banks seized the opportunities available in the benign conditions of 2006 and pushed ahead on all fronts, particularly in retail banking. Unlike the previous year, the 2007 ranking represents a rapid resurgence for the banks and, just as profits showed strong growth of 21.9%, there was also substantial expansion in aggregate Tier 1 capital and aggregate total assets.  Capital boost  To accommodate rapidly expanding balance sheets, banks boosted capital: aggregate Tier 1 capital increased by a sizeable 18.4% to $3365.1bn in the 2007 ranking. This represents a marked change from the modest 3.7% growth last year and a return to the kind of growth rates seen in the first two years of this four-year banking boom (15.2% and 20.5%).  Aggregate total assets followed the same expansion pattern with banks building their loan books across all product areas. Overall assets grew by a solid 16.3%, almost three times the previous years growth rate, to reach $74,232.2bn. While EU27 banks produced 20.5% asset growth and the US banks 12.5% in the 2007 listing, emerging markets, such as China, are achieving extremely high lending growth. The total assets of the four huge state-owned Chinese banks grew by 27.4% in 2006, and further similar growth is expected.  Fears of a US meltdown and problems in the US sub-prime mortgage sector did not impact materially on 2006 performances, and banks took advantage of lower oil prices and vibrant consumer expenditure. However, as gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the major economies is expected to decline to 2.3% this year and interest rates are tightening, the banks may be moving into a slower expansion period.  Record growth  Have the worlds banks reached their peak after four successive record years? If the record run is to continue, from where will the growth come? Key economies, such as Japan and Germany, now have their banking sectors back in the black after taking some severe losses in recent years. Japans 101 banks produced $52.9bn in profits in this Top 1000 and Germanys 88 banks totalled $34.6bn, with only four loss-making banks between them. But can they expand yet again? Japans banks account for 10% of the Top 1000 Tier 1 capital and total assets but just 7% of overall profits; and the return on capital of the Japanese banks remains weak, at 16.2%, and well below the global average. German banks profitability is also weak at 13.6%. Without major structural change, neither country is likely to provide above average profitability or growth.  US banks remain the bulwark of the Top 1000 as they have done for years but US dominance of the ranking nevertheless appears to be in slow decline in some respects. The 185 US banks in the 2007 listing account for 19.1% of aggregate Tier 1 capital, at $642.1bn, and 13.2% of aggregate assets, at $49,826.4bn, which through good efficiencies account for a large 23.6% of aggregate profits, at $185.5bn. And, with a return on capital this year of 28.9%, US banks are well above the 23.4% global average and remain some of the most profitable in the world.  Even so, US banks as a group are losing their grip on the rankings. The number of US banks has slipped from 211 in 2004 to 197 in 2005 and 2006, to 185 in 2007. The US proportion of aggregate totals is also slipping. From 22%, 15% and 37% of Tier 1 capital, total assets and total profits, respectively, in the 2004 Top 1000, the US banks declined to 20.7%, 13.7% and 26.5% in the 2006 Top 1000, and to 19.1%, 13.2%, and 23.6%, respectively, of the 2007 ranking. Although the changes are not large, the US banks role in global banking is certainly less than it was.  EU role expands  The EU role, in contrast, is picking up slightly. The EU provides the largest grouping of banks in the ranking  286 in 2006 and 279 this year  and all key indicators show that the overall EU proportion is growing. From 40.7% of capital, 50.7% of assets and 37.4% of profits in 2006, the proportions have increased to 42%, 52.5% and 40.7%, respectively, in 2007, making the expanded EU27 banks by far the largest grouping. Profitability is also improving, increasing from 20.9% in 2006 to 22.7% in our latest ranking.  Among the EU27 banks, the 18 UK banks in the 2007 Top 1000 listing remain the most profitable country group, providing an aggregate $81.5bn in pre-tax profits with a return on capital of 27.3%, well ahead of the EU27 average of 22.7% but behind the US. The UK has four banks in the Top 25 world banks, and remains well ahead of the other Europeans in key aggregate indicators. However, in terms of profitability (return on capital), Belgium leads the Europeans with a 32% return on capital , ahead of Sweden (29.5%), the UK, Spain (25.3%), France (23%) and Germany at the bottom with 13.6%.  Better performance  Other areas have continued to provide healthy growth. The 174 Asian banks (excluding Japan) in the Top 1000 (up from 163 previously) showed a 20.2% growth in profits as the Chinese, Australian, South Korean and Indian banks all boosted performances. Aggregate Asian capital increased by 26.8%, preparing the way for the future as aggregate assets expanded by 16.2%. These Asian banks are expected to expand considerably in the future and account for much more than this years 14.5% of aggregate Tier 1 capital and 12.2% of overall profits.  The Middle East banks have increased their presence in the ranking from 83 last year to 94 this year, with Bahrains Awal Bank leading the new arrivals list. With oil prices strong and Middle East banks awash with liquidity, they have boosted profits by 30.5% to reach $26.5bn and achieved a 23% return on capital, slightly lower than last years 24.5% aggregate return. Despite this growth and the huge wealth in the region, however, the 94 Middle East banks are still relatively small players on the global scene, accounting for just 3.4% of aggregate Tier 1 capital, 1.7% of total assets and 3.3% of aggregate profits.  The 42 Latin American banks had a relatively sluggish year: aggregate profits were up just 4.9% to $18.2bn, overall lending or total assets increased by a significant 26.2%, and Tier 1 capital moved up by just 7.3%.  Big regional movers  Regionally, the major movers in profit terms are the EU27 and Middle East banks, achieving growth of 32.4% and 30.5% respectively. These are well ahead of the Asians (20.2%), the US (8.5%), the Latin Americans (4.9%) and the Japanese (3%).  Although mergers and acquisitions and the consolidation trend will continue to have an impact on the rankings, there were relatively fewer big deals in calendar year 2006 than seem likely this year  the current acquisition of ABN AMRO is expected to herald a number of big deals in 2007. BNP Paribass acquisition of Italys BNL and Bank of Americas purchase of MBNA in 2006 were significant moves, the latter catapulting Bank of America to the top of the current rankings.  For the first time since our 1999 ranking, a new bank heads The Banker Top 1000. Citigroups eight-year reign at the top has come to an end as it was narrowly overtaken by Bank of America Corp (BoA) following its purchase of MBNA Corp, among other acquisitions, which lifted BoAs Tier 1 capital at the end of 2006 by 23% to $91.1bn, just slightly ahead of Citigroups at $90.9bn.  Rule of the titans  Although the top six banks, or six titans, were the same as last year, their positions shifted markedly. HSBC Holdings, despite an 18.1% increase in Tier 1 capital, slipped from second to third place with $87.8bn and Crdit Agricole jumped up to fourth from sixth with a 40.1% rise in Tier 1 capital to $84.9bn. With JP Morgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, these six titans, like...
