HONG KONG (Reuters) - Top U.S. lender Bank of America (BAC.N: Quote), raising cash to weather a dismal market at home, sold a $2.83 billion chunk of its holding in China Construction Bank (0939.HK: Quote) on Wednesday, dragging the Chinese bank's stock 6 percent lower.  China's three largest banks attracted big strategic investments from western financial giants at the time of their initial public offerings. Those investors are now under pressure to shed their stakes as the global financial crisis ravages the banking industry, and further sales are expected.  Bank of America sold more than 5.62 billion shares, or nearly 13 percent of its holding in Construction Bank, at HK$3.92 apiece, according to a term sheet obtained by Reuters and a person familiar with the matter, in a deal that had been widely anticipated by the market. 'The news has been expected but investors will still take it hard because BoA will most definitely sell more. They need the money,' said Francis Lun, general manager with Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong.  Bank of America realizes a profit of about $1.13 billion on the stake sale, based on Construction Bank's IPO price. It sold  the stake at a 12 percent discount to the stock's Tuesday close.  Bank of America had planned and then canceled a similar sale last month, sources familiar with the situation said.  The stake sold represents about 2.5 percent in Construction Bank, and will leave Bank of America with a 16.6 percent holding in the Beijing-controlled lender.
