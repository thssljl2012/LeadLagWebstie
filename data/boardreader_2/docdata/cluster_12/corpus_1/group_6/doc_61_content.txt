Company says insufficient earnings will lead to violation of credit agreement  OSHKOSH  Oshkosh Corp. said today insufficient earnings will violate the firms credit agreement with its lead banks and require it to seek a costly amendment in the second quarter.  We have some very compelling strengths, Robert Bohn, chairman and chief executive officer, said during a Web conference call. Amending the credit agreement (will) obtain the relief needed to weather the recessionary storm.  The company reported fiscal 2009 first quarter sales down 7 percent, to $1.4 billion, and a net loss of $20.6 million, or 28 cents per share. The results compare with earnings of 50 cents per share on net sales of $1.5 billion and net income of $37.3 million for the same quarter of 2008.  Bohn said earnings wont be sufficient the balance of the year to avoid violating the financial covenant in the companys credit agreement, prompting the need to seek an amendment with its lead banks, the Bank of America and JP Morgan.  While the companys access equipment subsidiary, JLG, is struggling, prompting the firm to impose workforce reductions and one-to two-week unpaid furloughs for staff, its defense, fire apparatus and domestic refuse collection vehicle businesses continue to post solid results.  Our Pierce (fire apparatus) business continues to outperform the competition, said Charlie Szews, president and chief operating officer. Pierce market share grew by 5 percentage points in the most recently published rolling 12-month data.  Pierce Manufacturing employs 1,900 people at its plants in the Town of Menasha and Grand Chute.
