Chairman and CEO Lewis Gould said in the companys third quarter SEC filing that QEP was taking significant actions to reduce expenses and adjust its operating plans.  The company is trying to cut costs and conserve cash by cutting its workforce and employee hours, and tightening purchasing and inventory, Gould said in the Jan. 23 filing.  The Boca Raton-based marketer and distributor of 3,000 flooring tools and accessories ran into a collapsing construction market, dwindling market demand and liquidity problems.  QEP (NASDAQ: QEPC) had a loss of $8.4 million, or $2.48 a share, on revenue of $48.6 million for the quarter ended Nov. 30. For the prior-year period, it reported a profit of $794,000, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $54.6 million.  For the first nine months of fiscal 2009, the company had a loss of $6.3 million, or $1.86 per share, on revenue of $162.5 million. For the first nine months of fiscal 2008, it had a profit of $1.7 million, or 47 cents a share, on revenue of $168.8 million.  Much of the third quarters declared loss was a goodwill write-down of $7.9 million, leaving a goodwill balance sheet asset of just $839,000 for QEPs Canadian business segment.  As of Nov. 30, the company said it had breached its financial covenants as a result of the quarters loss and was in default under its domestic credit facilities and Canadian mortgage.  Bank of America and HSBC Bank USA entered into a forbearance agreement with QEP for continuance of the default until March 16.  Its main credit revolver was cut from $35 million to $30 million, and the interest rates were raised on virtually all its domestic and foreign credit lines, most of which were near their maximum draws.  Shares of QEP closed down 25 cents to $1.70. The 52-week high was $10 on Feb. 15. The stock reached a new 52-week low $1.60 in Tuesday trading.
