Coles owner Wesfarmers Ltd has refused to confirm reports it is close to refinancing debt of more than $7 billion that is due in the next two years.  The report in Monday's The Australian Financial Review claimed Wesfarmers had negotiated fresh terms with about two-thirds of its lenders.  The diversified retail and resources conglomerate is seeking to pay down debt related to its $20 billion acquisition of the Coles group in 2007 - the largest completed takeover in Australian corporate history.  A Wesfarmers spokeswoman told AAP that the Perth-headquartered company would not comment on the report.  She said the company 'continues to consider a range of options on refinancing', quoting its update to the Australian Securities Exchange last week.  The newspaper report speculated that some of Wesfarmers' financiers, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank, had agreed to roll over their existing loans to Wesfarmers for at least another 12 months.  The report said Wesfarmers' key relationship banks, including Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp, were understood to also be in the process of signing to new refinancing terms.
