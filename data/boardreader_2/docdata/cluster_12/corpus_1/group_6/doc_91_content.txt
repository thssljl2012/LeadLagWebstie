This refers to your edit Citibank going bust? (ET, Jan 19). Citi is a strong, highly rated, and well-capitalised institution. At the end of the fourth quarter, Citis Tier-1 capital ratio was approximately 11.8%, which is well in excess of the well capitalised regulatory minimums and among the highest in the industry.   Citi continues to boast a strong deposit base that is diversified across products and regions. This diversification, including deep access to international deposits, provides us with an important stable and low-cost source of funding. Our capacity to make commitments to our clients around the world is as strong as ever. The strength of Citis balance sheet and our ability to deliver for clients in tough conditions are some of the key reasons why the largest corporates, institutions and sponsors do business with us. We are focused on delivering the services that our clients have come to expect of a relationship-focused global bank.   In India, profits from Citibanks operations doubled to Rs 1,804 crore by March 31, 2008, making it the most profitable foreign bank in India. The banks balance sheet grew 24% to stand at Rs 104,363 crore at September 30, 2008, versus March 31, 2008. Capital adequacy at 12% at September 2008 (Tier-1 Capital being 11.2%) is more than what is required to be maintained by banks in India under regulations. This compares very favourably with peer banks. The bank has a robust balance sheet and enjoys a strong presence in all customer segments.   Sanjay Nayar   CEO   Citi South Asia, January 23
