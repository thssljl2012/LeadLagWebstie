The Mid Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce is offering practical support to firms to protect jobs through grants and expertise.And those involved in the housing sector are looking to join forces to ensure people keep a roof over their heads and are sheltered from the worst excesses of the economic downturn.At a specially convened housing summit, they looked to set up new schemes to help builders and buyers, possibly by reintroducing council mortgages and guarantees.Phil Jenks, chief operating officer at the Halifax, said the problems affecting the economy were largely dependent on what happened in America.Despite the dramatic slump in property sales, the situation was nowhere near as bad as many believed and the impending takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB could bring benefits.The new company would provide 29 per cent of all mortgages and become the country's second largest insurer.Calderdale Council's head of housing and community support, Mark Thompson, said the inability of people to borrow money was leading to burgeoning demand for rented properties and housing assistance.'We might have to consider introducing council schemes for financial assistance in the same way we used to provide mortgages,' he said.The latest survey by the chamber of commerce underlines the problems and brought a plea by executive director Andrew Choi for action not words.The record 127 businesses responding to the survey show confidence at rock bottom and have prompted demands for a cut in interest rates and Corporation Tax as well as the restoration of rate relief on empty properties.'We are doing all we can, with the invaluable backing of the council and Yorkshire Forward, to help Calderdale businesses at the time it's needed most, which is now and not when the crisis is over,' said Mr Choi.The chamber has three loan funds " Halifax Business, Phoenix and Rural " which can provide thousands of pounds in top-up grants and loans.
