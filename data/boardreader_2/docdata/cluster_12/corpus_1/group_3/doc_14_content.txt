Like many individuals over the last decade, Leeds has revelled in the boom years. The city has developed its reputation as a serious international player in the financial services market and has grown to become largest UK centre outside of London for financial and business services with some 124,000 employees.But the credit crunch has meant that the boom , for many, is now over. On a personal level, people are feeling the pinch and on a professional level, the evidence of the downturn in the city centre is obvious.Where a shining monument to the growth of Leeds  the Lumiere towers  should have been rising upwards from Wellington Street there now stands a deserted building site.In the financial services sector, the credit crunch has yet to claim a high-profile victim in the city itself but the whiff of impending gloom hangs in the air.Observers and MPs have suggested the demise of HBOS and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley, on the fringe of the city itself but part of what politicians like to describe as the Leeds city region, are expected to lead to the culling of high street branches and back office duplication and, with it, significant numbers of jobs.But the message from industry leaders in Leeds to workers in the sector is a simple two words, long associated with Lance Corporal Jones of Dad's Army fame: 'Don't panic'.While these mixed messages fuel the current debate, they will do little to calm the fears of many workers in the city.Gary Lumby, head of retail and small business banking at the Leeds-based Yorkshire Bank, has just taken over the presidency of Leeds Chamber of Commerce.He said that, while not wanting to make light of the current situation, he didn't believe there was a reason to panic.'It would be wrong to say we are not concerned when two brands which are well represented in this city are going through a period of momentous change and we shouldn't try to diminish the situation and say it's not going to affect us.'But neither should we jump to any conclusions until we see exactly what is being proposed (with regard to the Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley and HBOS/Lloyds TSB deals).'This is not the time to panic. The Chamber will be talking to senior management of these organisations and the Regional Development Authority (Yorkshire Forward) and we will make sure we do what we can.'There is a great deal of diversity in the financial services sector in Leeds and that is its strength.'We have the people and the skills and the low cost base. I don't believe there will be any short-term fall out but if people are concerned, organisations like the Chamber will be there to support them.'But his qualified optimism is not necessarily shared in the city.Tim Whitehead, investment manager at Leeds-based stockbroker Redmayne-Bentley, said the Government's decision to nationalise Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley and immediately dispose of the branch and deposit business to Banco Santander would 'undoubtedly result in significant job reductions in the region'.He said Santander's UK operation  Abbey National  was already faced with the task of integrating Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester, which it acquired earlier in the year.The most obvious source of cost savings would be the closure of multiple high street branches and an integration of head office administration.He added: 'When taken in conjunction with the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyd's TSB, West Yorkshire would certainly seem to be in line for considerable rationalisation. The effects will undoubtedly spread to support sectors, such as the legal profession.'And he warned that integrating banks of such magnitude could not be completed overnight, adding that the full effects might not be felt for some time.But there was some good news.'These unprecedented developments are a consequence of wider financial pressures and do not, necessarily, undermine Leeds position as a financial centre,' he added.'The rationale for the city's prominence in this area remains intact; with a deep pool of educated staff and strong ancillary professions. In the long term, the city will continue to prosper, but, regrettably, there will be considerable hardship in the interim.'The body which represents the financial services sector in Leeds  the Leeds Financial Services Initiative  today repeated the 'don't panic' mantra.John Ansbro, chief executive of the organisation, told the YEP: 'The current turmoil in the financial markets is unprecedented and we are in unchartered territory  so it is not possible to say we are past the worst or not.'But steps taken in the USA, in the UK and Europe, and generally globally, show that there is the resolve and the will to stop things getting worse. The banking sector and national governments are working closely to maintain stability.'It is a question of holding one's nerve.'
