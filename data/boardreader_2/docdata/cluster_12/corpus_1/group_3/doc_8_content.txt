 BLUE BELL, Pa. --(Business Wire)-- Corporate Call Center, Inc. (CCC), a privately held teleservices and call center company, today announced that Guardian Capital Partners (GCP), a private equity firm that invests in middle market manufacturing and service companies, has acquired a controlling interest in the company. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.        Claudia Timbo, founder, president and CEO of CCC, remains in her current role, as does CFO and CTO Adel Sidky. Both Timbo and Sidky have retained their minority ownership positions with the company. GCP's investment in and partnership with CCC will augment the company's ability to address growing demand for its differentiated service offerings. CCC specializes in providing highly trained, licensed and credentialed customer service representatives to insurance, healthcare and other consumer markets for membership enrollment, customer service, lead generation, and other inbound and outbound communications. Its unique staffing model, coupled with superior information technology, and applied expertise in Medicaid and Medicare services positions CCC to capitalize on favorable industry trends.        An increasing number of companies today are moving away from in-house customer service operations, and engaging outsourced providers to enhance customer support, reduce costs, leverage advanced technologies, and reach out to customers across a variety of channels. The rapidly growing senior population in the U.S. and increasingly complex insurance landscape requires higher skilled and more specialized customer services representatives - often requiring specific licenses and permits. By recruiting and training retired professionals and transitional executives who are naturally 'in touch' with the needs of seniors, and providing one of the highest percentages of licensed and credentialed representatives in the industry, CCC is able to staff its call centers with personnel whose backgrounds and experiences are closely linked to its clients' customers and targets. 'CCC's mission remains the same,' noted GCP Managing Partner Hugh Kenworthy. 'The company will continue leveraging its hiring, training and technology to become the premier provider of licensed and credentialed - and experienced - customer service representatives for the insurance and healthcare markets. Analyst firm International Data Corp predicts the outsourced call center industry to grow an average of 12 percent per year, and we believe CCC's unique, high-touch model will allow the company to extend its Medicaid service offerings to more insurance providers nationwide.' 'CCC's success is rooted in our ability to strike the optimal balance of credentialed people and advanced technology to address our clients' specific needs,' said CCC Founder, President and CEO Claudia Timbo. 'Our alliance with GCP will help fuel the organic growth we've experienced so far, and enhance our ability to attract and retain larger clients in the insurance, healthcare/wellness and financial services industries.' CCC employs approximately 400 and operates out of offices and call centers in Blue Bell, PA (suburban Philadelphia). About Corporate Call Center, Inc.
