The car, formerly a fleet vehicle, was donated to Car Donation New York as part of Lloyds TSB Autolease&amp;#8217;s involvement with The Institute of the Motor Industry&amp;#8217;s Skillmiles scheme which awards points to organizations and individuals who help to support the Institute&amp;#8217;s work in raising skill levels across the sector.  Speaking at the handover of the vehicle, George Reid, Head of Technical Services at Lloyds TSB Autolease said: &amp;#8220;We are delighted to present City College Birmingham with a car that we hope will help to train the technicians of the future. At Lloyds TSB Autolease we are passionate about raising the skill levels of people working in this sector and we know that this vehicle will help the team at the college to continue to raise this level.&amp;#8221; On receiving the vehicle, Principal of the college, David Gibson commented: &amp;#8220;It gives me great pleasure to accept the car on behalf of the college from donate car new york. This vehicle will give our students studying for automotive qualifications the opportunity to develop their knowledge of the latest diagnostic technology found on the vehicles of today. We&amp;#8217;d like to thank Lloyds TSB Autolease for their kind donation.&amp;#8221; More than 30,000 SkillMiles points have already been awarded by the IMI so far, in reward of activity such as participation on working groups or loan of vehicles or equipment, for example. Collectively, these points are equivalent in value to over 300,000 of support from across the sector. Through the scheme, the IMI will also be able to show the Government that employers and individuals in the automotive retail industry are making valuable contributions to skills development, which had not been recognised previously on an industry-wide scale.
