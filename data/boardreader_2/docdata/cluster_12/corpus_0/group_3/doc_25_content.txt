So was it just me, or was anyone else gob-smacked on their commute to find that today's Metro came wrapped in a 4 page advertising spread for the Lloyds TSB mobile banking service, whilst the main headline inside was &amp;quot;&amp;pound;50bn buy-up to save banks&amp;quot; including, of course, Lloyds TSB?          Did nobody at Lloyds TSB think this may not be a good time to use the slogan &amp;quot;It's for you&amp;quot;, when the only thing the average taxpayer is getting from the bank this week is a whopping great bill?
