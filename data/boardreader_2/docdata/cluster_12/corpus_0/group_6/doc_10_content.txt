Sent this bit of wank to MONEY mag today. bet they don't publish it, fuckwits!Supporting your own companies i.e. ones that you own shares in, can add a rewarding dimension to your investing activities.For example, I have shares in a range of companies that provide goods and services to consumers eg Commonwealth Bank, David Jones, Qantas etc.  Whilst the old shareholder discount scheme pioneered by Coles, is dead and buried (one of the last hold-outs, David Jones, will close down its scheme in February), I still find it immensely satisfying to shop or utilise the services of my own companies  its like putting money back into my own pocket. So if I need a new TV, its off to DJs I go. If Im planning a holiday and I can fly Qantas or Jetstar, Ill make every effort to do that. When it comes to banking, I stick to the majors, the ones I own shares in. If you need some hardware or new plants for the garden and you own shares in Wesfarmers, then try Bunnings, a Wesfarmers subsidiary. And who doesnt own a tiny slice of Telstra? So next time youre considering a new telephone service or a new mobile phone plan, try them first. As a Westfield shareholder, I make sure to do my shopping at their centres. And Ill never go past Coles or Woollies without stopping to buy something!It doesnt always work because sometimes you just cant get what you want at the best price at your favoured company, but I always give it a try.  And of course, normal prudent investment considerations should always apply. (ABC Learning anyone? Luckily my kids are grown up!)
