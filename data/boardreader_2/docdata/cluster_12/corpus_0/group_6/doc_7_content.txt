ABI Research is projecting that the number of people banking through a mobile device could hit half a billion worldwide by 2013, according to MediaPost. The report said that this, combined with increasing customer familiarity and growing ease of use, could make mobile banking the next "killer app" for cell phones.  "Mobile financial services have the potential to be bigger than mobile TV and premium mobile content in terms of numbers of subscribers," said Mark Beccue, ABI Research senior analyst of consumer mobility in the article. "Everybody's trying to do it, and they're all scrambling."  Beccue said in the report that online customers in particular feel comfortable banking on cell phones. "That's one of the only barriers to mobile banking; if you don't trust online, you won't trust mobile." He added that Bank of America currently leads in mobile banking; it launched its service in May 2007 and reported having 1.5 million customers using it actively by the end of 2008.
