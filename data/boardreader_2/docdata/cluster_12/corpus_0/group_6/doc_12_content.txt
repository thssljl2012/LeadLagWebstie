From Institutional Investor: Turkeys Military Pension Fund Reaps Windfall Jonathan Kandell 08 Jan 2009 Despite tensions between Turkeys generals and the moderate Islamic government, OYAK, the military pension fund, has made the most of the countrys pro-business policies. For emerging-markets economies, it&#8217;s a sign of maturity to develop truly world-class enterprises. Mexico can boast of cement producer Cemex, Brazil of aircraft maker Embraer, South Korea of electronics giant Samsung or automaker Hyundai. In Turkey arguably the best claim to such lofty status belongs not to an industrial company but to a pension fund - and the military&#8217;s at that. Ordu Yardimlasma Kurumu, or OYAK, as it is known, operates like a private equity fund rather than a portfolio investor, is more profitable than any of Turkey&#8217;s family-run conglomerates and enjoys a higher credit rating than the government. The man responsible for that success, Coskun Ulusoy, is a military history buff who approaches the art of the deal like a general preparing for battle. Since taking over as CEO in 2000, his investing acumen has helped OYAK deliver a sixfold increase in retirement benefits to the country&#8217;s military brass - and earned him a reputation as Turkey&#8217;s Warren Buffett. He describes his strategy bluntly: &#8220;We buy companies, manage them, turn them around and sell them for big profits.&#8221; After a run of stellar returns, however, Ulusoy today finds his 22.41 billion Turkish lira ($14.4 billion) fund threatened on two fronts. Rising political tensions between Turkey&#8217;s military and the moderate Islamic government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose pro-business policies have contributed to OYAK&#8217;s stunning success, are threatening to undermine the country&#8217;s economic gains. At the same time, a deepening global recession is thrashing stock markets around the world, slowing capital inflows into Turkey and provoking a sharp slide in the lira. The sudden deterioration in the investment climate threatens to dent the pension fund&#8217;s returns and stall Ulusoy&#8217;s plans to expand internationally. Notwithstanding those challenges, OYAK&#8217;s bold commander remains remarkably upbeat about the outlook. The pension fund has amassed an acquisition war chest of $3.2 billion, thanks to astutely timed divestments of some of its banking and insurance holdings in the past 18 months - at virtually the peak of the market. Although he put his shopping plans on hold late in 2008 because of the global market turmoil, Ulusoy hopes to find attractive assets at even cheaper prices in the upcoming year. &#8220;We have plenty of cash on hand for future investments,&#8221; the blunt, 58-year-old executive tells Institutional Investor in an interview at OYAK&#8217;s spartan offices overlooking the Bosporus in central Istanbul. He says potential targets include construction, energy and mining projects in Europe and North America. &#8220;We definitely want to go abroad, and this is the time to diversify,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We can&#8217;t keep all our investments in Turkey for risk reasons.&#8221; Those risks have ratcheted up sharply in recent months. Weakening global demand has taken a huge bite out of Turkey&#8217;s exports. In the third quarter of 2008, GDP expanded by an anemic 0.5 percent compared with the same period in 2007 - the slowest rate since 2002. Yarkin Cebeci, an Istanbul-based economist for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., predicts growth will slow to 2.5 percent in 2009 from 3.5 percent in 2008. The lira plunged by 26 percent against the dollar in October alone and was trading just below 66 U.S. cents in late December, down 24 percent for the year. The Istanbul Stock Exchange&#8217;s 100 index was off nearly 53 percent since the beginning of the year. And according to Cebeci, foreign direct investment into Turkey will likely have fallen to less than $15 billion by year-end 2008 from $22 billion a year earlier. With the global credit crisis reducing inflows of foreign loans and investments upon which Turkey has depended for its high economic growth, the government has been forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for the fourth time in ten years. Negotiations were under way in December for an IMF loan that could reach $40 billion. (The Turkish government hopes to announce a deal in January when an IMF delegation is scheduled to visit the country.) Still, given the tough environment, Ulusoy plans to go ahead with his international expansion plans, says OYAK chief investment officer Caner ner. He acknowledges that OYAK companies are vulnerable to the sliding stock market, and &#8220;returns may be affected as a result of decreasing dividends,&#8221; but notes that the $3.2 billion the pension fund has set aside for acquisitions is distributed between lira, dollars and euros - and is mostly liquid. As markets and growth projections have tumbled, political friction has mounted between Turkey&#8217;s secular establishment, which enjoys strong backing from the military, and Erdogan&#8217;s ruling Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials AKP. The government earlier this year passed a law to allow women to wear headscarves at Turkish universities. Opponents promptly challenged the move in the constitutional court, arguing that the change violated the secular traditions established by Mustafa Kemal Atatrk, who founded modern Turkey in 1923. The court overturned the headscarf law in June, but one month later it narrowly rejected a request by the country&#8217;s top prosecutor to ban the AKP, which would have provoked a political crisis and forced early elections. The court decided instead to cut state funding to the party in half. The ruling sparked a brief rally in Turkish markets, but tensions between the military and the government flared anew in October when 86 people, including several retired generals, went on trial on charges of carrying out assassinations and bomb attacks in a bid to sow chaos and provoke a coup to overthrow the government. The case is not expected to end for at least several months. The infighting between the military and the government is no small irony - retired army officers, after all, have benefited economically as much as anyone in Turkish society from the Erdogan government. The AKP took power in 2001 when the country was struggling to recover from a severe economic crisis that had forced it into the arms of the IMF. Erdogan&#8217;s government implemented IMF-endorsed reforms that slashed inflation to single digits, fostered robust growth of 6 percent a year and attracted unprecedented inflows of foreign investment. OYAK took advantage of that turnaround to generate average annual returns of 47 percent from 2000 to 2007, compared with an average annual rise of 14 percent on the Istanbul stock market during the period. The fund generated net income of TL3.2 billion in 2007 alone, up 54.2 percent from a year earlier. Ulusoy, a former banker whose father was a military doctor, likes to point out that OYAK&#8217;s 2007 profits easily outdistanced those of the Ko Group (TL2.29 billion) and Sabanci Holding (TL969.5 million), two giant Turkish business conglomerates. OYAK has steered clear of politics, preferring instead to focus on performance. The fund avoids investments in defense-related activities, pays taxes like any other business and is not subsidized by the government. At the end of 2007, OYAK had 235,818 members, of whom 36,390 were retirees. Besides a lump sum for retirement - a brigadier general who put in 30 years of service received TL270,910 in 2008 - members can buy homes at a price just above construction cost and take out personal loans from the pension fund&#8217;s credit union. OYAK&#8217;s stellar performance has won it a reputation of near-infallibility among Istanbul&#8217;s financial elite. &#8220;They are Turkey&#8217;s only real institutional investor,&#8221; says Mehmet Sami, an executive board member at ATA Invest, an Istanbul-based brokerage, who has sometimes found himself on the losing side of business battles with the pension fund. In 2005 he advised Luxembourg-based Arcelor (acquired by India&#8217;s Mittal Steel the following year) as it competed with OYAK to acquire steelmaker Erdemir. &#8220;Their cash flows and returns are fantastic, more like a successful private equity fund than a pension fund.&#8221; OYAK&#8217;s private equity strategy was born of necessity. The fund was founded in 1961, one year after a military coup brought to power a government that sought to ingratiate itself with the electorate by broadening social security coverage to include blue-collar civil servants and creating independent, private pension funds for groups such as the military and the police. Only OYAK, with its unique approach to investing, survived. When it began collecting 10 percent of its members&#8217; monthly base salaries, it soon faced the problem of what to do with the capital - it was the 1960s, and there were no money-market accounts or local stock exchange listings. It appeared that OYAK&#8217;s only investment option was to put the money into savings accounts, but individuals could do that on their own. Instead OYAK opted to buy companies and use their dividends to finance its members&#8217; pensions. That led to a private equity approach to investment decades before it was popularized in the U.S. and Europe. &#8220;Because there was no effective corporate governance in Turkey - no transparency or clear accounting rules - the only way to know that you were doing the right thing with members&#8217; money was to acquire enough of a stake in a company to join management and see how well it was being run,&#8221; explains Ulusoy. OYAK took majority stakes in domestic companies that operated in iron and steel products, cement and concrete, food processing and distribution and financial services and also formed a fe...
