The position of personal guarantees when borrowing via a SMSF continues to attract mixed comment.      It's interesting to note that the CBA recently released their SMSF product called SuperGear. In their documentation they provide a taxation letter from Greenwoods &amp; Freehills (dated 3 Nov 2008) providing a general outline of the tax implications of the SuperGear product.      In particular under the heading of "Non-arm's length income" Greenwoods &amp; Freehills state;      "Provided that all dealings between parties are at arm's length (including the acquistion of the Asset and the leasing of the Asset), SuperGear, including any indemnity given by a SMSF member to CBA, should not cause the non-arms length provisions, which can cause income to be taxed at 45%, to apply to a SMSF Trustee".      Anybody got any comment/thoughts on the above?
