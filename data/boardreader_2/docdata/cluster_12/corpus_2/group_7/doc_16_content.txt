ONDON (SHARECAST) - US bank JP Morgan has been assessing the implications of President Obama&#146;s bail-out plans for UK banks with major US interests, and suggests more rights issues could be on the way if they want to take advantage of US aid.    Though full details of the plan are not yet available, banks will be &#147;required to have a buffer to absorb the potential losses that could be experienced in the stress test. If they do not currently meet this criteria, they will have to raise capital,&#148; warns JP Morgan (JPM) analyst Carla Antunes da Silva.     Barclays has $112bn of direct US customer loans. &#147;At a group level, there is a significantly higher proportion of US assets and it is unclear whether the scheme would cover these. Note they have been able to participate in other US schemes to date,&#148; JPM notes.    JPM has retained its underweight ratings on UK bank stocks and believes the UK will introduce similar measures to the US later on this month which will remove &#147;some of the recent optimism following the hand-out to ING.&#148;
