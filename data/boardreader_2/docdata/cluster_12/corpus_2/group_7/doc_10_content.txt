         Hello Pat  It's not jsut British banks Harmy.  Deutsche Bank is in trouble, as are the other two misfits, Commerz and Dresdner. Take a sideways glance at France, and you have Socgen,BNP in deep trouble as well as Calyon. Belgium, Holland, Spain aren't much better either.   Point taken but it was in reference to Australian and British banks.     I'm interested in seeing how the likes of CBA, NAB , St George fare as well. Westpac I'm sure has it's fingers in the cds/cdo pie.  *******  There are simply too many banking institutions all making a play for the same pie such that, to get the business the lucky institution concerned has had to pare margins to such an infintesimally small slither that it is hardly worth doing the business at all. Take away some of the players and business becomes more profitable for those that remain.   This makes far more sense. One of my previous posts referred to the part that the developing countries financial services sectors were likely to chisel away at the profit margins of Western institutions. Given that the financial services sector is one of the mainstays of the UK economy it should be a worrying trend. Harmy     Agree as long as its the UK instutions that lose out. Rbs is doomed for a long time. As is Commerzbank/Dresdner. Socgen in miserable shape. Italian and Belgian banks up the swannie. And spanish ones - noone has seen the full fallout of the collapse of spanish property on banco Santander.At least the latter is isolated from the cds/cdo debacle.   What is needed is for 20-30% of the banking institutions to disappear permanently.
