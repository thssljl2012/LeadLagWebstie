 BAK Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Australia to hold enquiry on China buying Oz resources         Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Australias Senate may hold an  inquiry as early as next week to scrutinize investments by  Chinese state-owned companies after  Aluminum Corp.  of Chinas bid  for a stake in Rio Tinto Group.         This is an economic question about giving another  government a stake in Australian resources, our biggest wealth  generator, Opposition Nationals Senator  Barnaby Joyce  said in a  phone interview from St. George in Queensland state. This is  not being parochial about foreign investment, it is about the  ownership of Australian resources being handed to another  government.         Joyce called for an inquiry to consider tightening Foreign  Investment Review Board rules and Chinese sovereign investment in  Australian resources. The committee has the power to summon  executives from companies and to block investments.         Chinalco, as the state-owned company is known, last week  agreed to buy $7.2 billion of convertible bonds and acquire  stakes in  Rio  projects for $12.3 billion.  China Minmetals  Corp.  has made a takeover bid for OZ  Minerals  Ltd. The proposals have  to be lodged with the review board, which will make a  recommendation to Treasurer  Wayne Swan , who has the power to  reject both deals.         Swan, 54, last week moved to change the Foreign Acquisitions  and Takeovers Act to allow for greater government oversight of  such investments. Former Austrian treasurer  Peter Costello   blocked Royal Dutch  Shell  Plcs bid for  Woodside  Petroleum Ltd.  in 2001.         Needs Support         Joyce needs support from his Liberal-National coalitions  other 35 senators and from five Greens to begin the inquiry.  Coalition treasury spokesman  Joe Hockey  and the Greens support  the inquiry, the Australian Financial Review cited them as saying  today.         Minerals demand has helped extend 17 years of economic   growth  in Australia, the largest shipper of coal, iron ore and  alumina. Waning demand from its biggest trading partners of China,  Japan and the U.S. may cut income from exports by 20 percent this  year, the Reserve Bank of Australia said Feb. 6.         China was the biggest buyer of Australian minerals in 2007,  purchasing one-fifth of the A$68.5 billion ($44 billion) worth of  exports. China said on Feb. 11  exports  fell last month by the  most in 13 years as demand dried up in the U.S. and Europe.         Hurting Mining Companies         The global financial crisis is hurting mining companies  and we need to know the ramifications of an increase in overseas  sovereign ownership in Australian mines, said Joyce, 41, who  also sits on the Senate Economics Committee, which would conduct  the inquiry. No one is against foreign ownership, but if you  have a dispute with a company it is very different from having a  dispute with a government.         Some 78 percent of Australians oppose investment in  Australia by Chinese government-controlled businesses, according  to a poll of 1,001 people by the Lowy Institute in September.         The Senate is a master of its own destiny, said Labor  Senator  Doug Cameron , who was formerly national secretary of the  Australian Manufacturing  Workers  Union. There are complex  issues negotiated with these state funds.         Chinas  Hunan Valin  Iron &amp; Steel Group is in talks to invest  in  Fortescue  Metals Group Ltd., Australias third-biggest iron  ore company.         Chinalcos investment in Rio will bolster Chinas bargaining  power to set iron ore prices, the China Iron and Steel  Association said last week. Chinalco would take 15 percent of  Rios Hamersley iron ore unit and jointly sell 30 percent of  output in China.         Export Licenses         Unions today called for the reinstatement of export licenses,  Australian Workers  Union  spokesman Andrew Casey said. The  licenses were abandoned 12 years ago to restrict Australian  government intervention in markets.         This will stop the Chinese government being able to force  the price of exports down, Casey said in a phone interview from  Sydney. The government has to act to help prevent job losses in  Australian mines.         Trade Minister  Simon Crean  called on China today to  reciprocate by allowing for greater investment by Australian  companies.         Australians have limitations on what we can invest in  China, Crean told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio today.  Lets sit down and have that discussion.
