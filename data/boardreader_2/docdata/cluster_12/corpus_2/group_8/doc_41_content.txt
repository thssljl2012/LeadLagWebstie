That is one of the reason that GLC convert their PS to common share at a lower price.          Firstly, I though dividend is a sure thing for Preference Share, can the issuer don't give out dividend?      Secondly, can such thing also happen to PS issued by local banks?  For the three local banks, all have PS listed.  Is this being disclosed in their IPO clauses?
