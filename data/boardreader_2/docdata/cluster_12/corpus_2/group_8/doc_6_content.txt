Wrong again Chaz, 3 of the banks are not committing any capital (see below).        Yet you blindly assure us only commerical loans will be approved, you do realise that all of these loans in the commercial property sector were once deemed commercial.  Why aren't they anymore Chaz?  Simple, the values of the property securing them has dropped.  But the ones Rudd bank lends to will be 'commercial'.  On what basis a valuers report based on no sales as the banks won't let any commercial property onto the market?        Value is what the market will pay and the banks are desperate to avoid any sales so that should tell you what the true value is.  Mess with the market at your peril.         Taxpayers wear risk of Rudd  George Lekakis      February 02, 2009 12:00am   THE RUDD Government has been dealt a blow on its planned commercial property funding vehicle.       This follows  three banks confirming that they would only provide loans to the fund, instead of $500 million each in upfront capital.     In response to questions raised by BusinessDaily on Friday, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Westpac each confirmed that they were treating their respective $500 million commitments to the fund as loan facilities rather than capital.       The disclosures raise the prospect that Australian taxpayers will be absorbing more than 90 per cent of the financial risk of the fund because the banks will not have equity in the venture.       The banks' disclosures to BusinessDaily also contradict assertions about the nature of the banks' involvement in the fund made by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in a media release on January 24.       In the release, Mr Rudd stated that the government and the major banks had "committed capital to the fund in equal partnership" to refinance commercial property loans affected by the withdrawal of foreign banks.       "This partnership will be initially capitalised at $4 billion, with the government contribution of $2 billion matched by an equal contribution by Australia's four major banks," the Prime Minister stated in the release.       The wording of the Prime Minister's January 24 statement and the official comments on Friday from the three major banks on the nature of their financial commitments suggest that the ANZ, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank did not see the statement before it was made public.       If the banks had intended to commit capital to the fund they typically would have made a disclosure to their investors via the Australian Securities Exchange.       None have made such disclosure so far.       "Westpac's initial $500 million will be provided as a loan to the special purpose vehicle," said Westpac spokesman David Lording.       "While the details are yet to be finalised, I understand it is not capital."       Commonwealth Bank spokesman Steve Batten said that his bank's commitment was "a straight loan".       And ANZ spokeswoman Cherelle Murphy said: "The details are yet to be finalised, but it will be a debt facility only."       The only bank not prepared to comment on whether it would have to commit equity capital to the partnership was NAB.       "We are awaiting further details on how the commercial property partnership would be funded and if it was a material issue we would make further details available to the market," NAB spokesman Brandon Phillips said.       The fund, which will officially be known as the Australian Business Investment Partnership( ABIP), has been established as foreign banks aggressively rein in new lending to corporate borrowers.
