(AP) -- Oshkosh Corp., which makes specialty vehicles and vehicle bodies, said Monday it has reached an agreement with its lenders to amend the company's $3.1 billion credit facility. Oshkosh shares jumped 34 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $5.33 in aftermarket trading, after gaining 4 cents to $4.99 during the regular session. The stock has traded between $3.85 and $42.59 during the past 52 weeks. ADVERTISEMENT According to a related Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the amendment increases Oshkosh's maximum allowed leverage ratio, among other changes. It also limits the amount of dividends or other restricted payments the company may pay during the remainder of fiscal 2009 to $5 million. In addition, Oshkosh is also required to prepay $100 million of its term loans as a condition of closing the amendment. "We believe the amendment will help provide financial flexibility as we operate our businesses during these difficult recessionary times," said Chairman and Chief Executive Robert G. Bohn in a statement. The amended agreement is effective March 9. Bank of America is serving as administrative agent for the facility.
