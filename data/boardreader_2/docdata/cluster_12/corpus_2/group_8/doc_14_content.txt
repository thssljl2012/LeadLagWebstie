 Investors are being lured back into the market with capital-protected products - but they come at a cost.        Crisis breeds innovation and you have to be very innovative indeed to sell shares to switched-off investors in the midst of the biggest financial crisis since the 1930s.         But that's what the banks are trying to do with the launch of products aimed at taking the fear and loathing out of share investing.        Last month Westpac launched BlueChip20, which allows you to invest in the top 20 Australian companies in small regular amounts; and Commonwealth Bank launched Capital Series Australia II, offering access to future capital growth in the top 200 shares with capital protection for anyone willing to lock away a minimum $10,000 for 51/2 years.        Late last year, ANZ unveiled its Online Investment Account, giving customers access to a portfolio of Australia's top 200 shares for as little as $1000 with the flexibility to make further contributions, or not, and relatively low fees.        BankWest (taken over by the Commonwealth Bank last year) has a similar product called Top 200, with a higher minimum investment and ongoing contributions.        Australian shares have fallen to their lowest level since 2003 but there is no guarantee they won't fall further in the short term or that there won't be more unpleasant surprises                 Sharkula wrote:                    DBS and OCBC up up up!!!
