 this post was  edited         Many of them left Accenture and went to bigger and better places such as the big 4 accounting firms. I have seen so many of them joined CBA, ANZ, WBC, NAB, some joined global banks such as Citi and HSBC. Others joined competitors such as Fujitsu and EDS and IBM. Depend on where you want to go.  I still know quite a few of them stuck with the Melbourne Telstra project and cant wait to get out. At current economic environment, its not that easy to land a job. So did you get a new job or still looking for one?
