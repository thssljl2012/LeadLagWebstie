You are right... Even more a reason to hold my calls!' BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan on Friday cut its 2009 earnings forecast and price targets for China's top Internet search firms Baidu.com Inc (BIDU.O), SINA Corp (SINA.O) and Sohu.com Inc (SOHU.O), citing slowing economic growth and advertising revenue. J.P. Morgan had earlier lowered its forecast for China's economic growth this year to 7.2 percent and said the country's advertising market growth would be flat in 2009, after an earlier projection of 5 percent growth. The lowered outlook comes a day after China said its economy grew 9.0 percent last year, the slowest pace in seven years. The U.S. bank revised down its December 2009 share price target for Baidu to $190, from $300. Baidu shares closed at $112.53 on Thursday on the Nasdaq exchange. Baidu's 2008 fourth quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) forecast was cut 6.3 percent to $1.19, and the diluted EPS forecast for the first quarter of this year by 19.1 percent to $0.93, said the bank. The target price for Internet media firm SINA was cut to $29, from an earlier $53 target, while the target for Sohu was dropped to $62, from $100. The shares of the two companies closed Thursday at $20.59 and $39.47, respectively. SINA's first quarter EPS was cut 5.7 percent to $0.33, while the firm's 2009 EPS was raised to 6.5 percent to $1.96. Sohu's first quarter EPS target was cut 6.4 percent to $1.02, while the full 2009 forecast was lowered 6.9 percent to $4.45. While the bank warned that near-term economic data would be weak, it also said there could be buying opportunities for investors in the three companies after the first quarter. J.P. Morgan expects Baidu.com's revenue to fall 11.7 percent in the first quarter of 2009 from the previous quarter to $116.5 million due to the slowing economy, but it maintained a positive view of the company down the road. Baidu continues to improve its technology and expand its potential to raise revenues, and the firm leads the country's fast growing search market, the bank said in a report. The bank was optimistic about Sina's prospects due to long-term online ad growth potential and its media role, but the firm's recent acquisition of Focus Media Ltd's (FMCN.O) core assets increased risk and uncertainty for the company. J.P. Morgan maintained an overweight rating on Sohu due to online advertising, but it said a slowing economy and delays in launching online games posed risks.
