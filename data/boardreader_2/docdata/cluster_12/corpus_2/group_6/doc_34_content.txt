Thank God !!! I did not join Satyam.      It is known to pay less and most of the employees they do L1 not major      H1 sponsorer and GC for the fear of losing their employees to other companies. That puts many in risk. Satyam does have lot of clients.      Once a company is black listed US firms do not engage in business deals.     This is a bad news for many Satyam employees especially at this bad recession time.
