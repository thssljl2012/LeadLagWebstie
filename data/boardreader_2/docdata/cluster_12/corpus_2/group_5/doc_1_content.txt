But ASB, Westpac, ANZ National Bank, Kiwibank and Bank of New Zealand all say that as long as borrowers do not miss payments, or do not remortgage, they won't be getting surprise demands for top-up payments to repair damaged loan to value ratios (LVR) the loan amount as a proportion of the property value it is secured against.      ASB's Ian Parke said: &amp;quot;Where someone has bought a home for $400,000 and suddenly it's worth $380,000, as long as they keep up with their payments, fluctuations in value don't matter.&amp;quot;                      Here is where property and shares have completely different measures of worth. The share market is very streamlined you don't generally have people purchase with their heart, they don't set their mind on a share and must have it at all cost.       It is easy for a lender to value shares as the price is monitored on a regular basis and a share in a company is worth 'x' not 'x+' because it has a nice yard and a pool.      So how would lenders prove that your property is worth less today than it was yesterday? They can only work against averages, and one can argue that averages are not the sum of a property. Will they send out valuers to each house? What will be the disputes resolution process?      If you honour your commitment and continue to make your repayments could you imagine the PR nightmare should the bank move you on because you couldn't find an extra $20k for the LVR shortfall. Imagine what this would do to the market? Further falls in values as property owners jump out of the market.       The value in shares is the volatility of the market. Because of the possibility of rapid change profit can be made. Houses are not as volatile and therefore are looked upon as a poor investment (don't howl me down just quoting my uni learnin').       Banks like to ensure they get back what they are owed if they auction one or two then the market is not affected however if they foreced everyone who's property was deemed to be less than the outstanding loan then sales of this magnitude would only ensure they lost money.      So how does a short-term result affect long-term planning? Does the current credit crunch mean that property prices will plummet and therefore I should stay out of the market, or do I say &amp;quot;property always goes up in the long run&amp;quot; and take the plunge anyway. If enough people dip their toes but do not take the plunge then the market takes a plunge, a self fulfilling prophecy.      I think I'll go for a dip. The water might not be fine, but it's no hotter than the rest of the environment I'm living in.      Andrew
