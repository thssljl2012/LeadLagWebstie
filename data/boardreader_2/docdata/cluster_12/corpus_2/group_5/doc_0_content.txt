       Australia&amp;#039;s third biggest miner OZ Minerals may lose more than its ranking  The predicament for mining house OZ Minerals now has stockbroking circles and business media proffering a series of scenarios for what was the third ranked Australian mining house, with few offering any joy to shareholders in what is currently a stalled debt re-financing. Author: Ross Louthean Posted:  Friday , 05 Dec 2008  PERTH -    http://www.mineweb.com/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page36?oid=74487&amp;amp;amp;sn=Detail   Public and media utterances on OZ Minerals Ltd (ASX: OZL), which is suspended from trading until at least December 29, now take in claims that a failure to gain bank refinancing could see the rolling of senior heads, including chief executive Andrew Michelmore.  As the Australian share market continues, at best, to crab sideways, the scenario of OZ Minerals facing potential danger has been viewed as far more serious than the plunge in Rio Tinto Ltd shares this week.  Rio Tinto is infinitely bigger than OZ Minerals, has less problems with its basket of commodities, and now has bank debts of $A1.08 billion ($US 698M) most of which were an endowment from Oxiana Ltd, the dynamic explorer and developer that merged with the more staid and larger Zinifex Ltd of which Michelmore took the helm in 2007.  Prior to this merger that created OZ Minerals, Zinifex was seen as strongly asset rich and cash sound.  What has soured most analysts and commentators was the perceived disclosure late last month of the size of debt and the immediacy of some maturing payments. At least two stockbrokers have reportedly said OZ Minerals could -- unless it sorts out its re-financing by December 29 -- be a takeover target for BHP Billiton, following its surprise recent withdrawal of its bid for Rio Tinto. This speculation has been amplified by a report in the national daily newspaper The Australian that Morgan Stanley had built up a stake of 6.89% in OZ Minerals by yesterday.  Prior to it seeking a voluntary trading halt the OZ Minerals share price had taken a pummelling, down from $A1.80 ($US ) in early October to A55 cents at the trading halt.  Columnist for The Australian, Matthew Stevens, reported today that the debt facility that matters right now is one of $A525 M ($US M) delivered by seven lenders, including Australia&amp;#039;s ANZ and National Australia Bank, The Bank of Scotland and what he termed &amp;amp;quot;the now infamous Hypo Bank.&amp;amp;quot;
