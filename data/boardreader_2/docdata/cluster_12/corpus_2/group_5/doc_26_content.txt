         I can't answer all your questions, but I do know that Cemex only pays out a dividend once a year (usually in May or June), not every quarter.  Details about the 2009 dividend (or whether there is one at all) probably won't be announced by the company until later in the spring.  I think the stock dividend is taxed at the dividend rate in the US, as though you received the cash value of the stock on the date of the dividend payment.  If you asked to receive cash instead of shares, there are complications and you could ALSO have to pay some additional short term capital gains taxes (because you are technically receiving the shares and then telling Citibank to sell the shares for you).  But I am not a tax professional.  Here's a link to the PDF of the letter they sent to shareholders for the 2008 dividend.  It has a few more details about how the distribution worked.   http://ww3.ics.adp.com/streetlink_data/dirCX/saB50B.PDF
