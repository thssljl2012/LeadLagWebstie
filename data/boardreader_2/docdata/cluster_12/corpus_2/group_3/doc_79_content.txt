 This article by Michael West appeared in SMH last week.  Although its about City Pacific, I think it makes an interesting read.           Time to shut down City Pac           by Michael West      October 23, 2008            The legion of small investors stuck in City Pacific&amp;#039;s mortgage fund should reject the swap proposal put by management, call in an administrator, put the thing under as quickly as possible and distribute whatever is left over.      To allow this questionable mob to trade on any longer is merely to allow Commonwealth Bank to clean up on penalty interest rates, Phil Sullivan and City&amp;#039;s discredited management to rip out more lush fees, and their property developer mates to stay on the funding drip, all while asset prices are falling.      We will explain in a tick why City Pacific has little hope of ever trading out of its predicament. Firstly, though, it should be made clear what options are open to beleaguered investors in the mortgage funds in respect of a wind-up.      CBA is the major secured creditor to the City Pacific First Mortgage Fund (FMF). It gets paid out first in the event of insolvency. After the employees and the receiver that is. Unsecured creditors, with their $900 million in savings frozen in the fund, rank behind secured creditors.      Those who are unlucky enough to own shares in the parent company also, into which management is trying to switch FMF unitholders, rank even further back in the queue and would be a snowflake&amp;#039;s chance in Hades of ever clawing back a cent were that to go belly up - which is probable.      Investors should also be aware that although CBA is also a creditor its interests are categorically not aligned with theirs.      Penalties      Already the bank appears to be charging penalty interest rates as City has been technically in default. Those penalties are likely to rise, and they bite directly into what FMF unitholders can expect to get back in a wind-up.      We are not suggesting there has been some sort of Faustian Pact struck here between City and its bankers, merely pointing out that CBA knows it has a buffer and will gouge as much out of this wobbling property empire as it can.      Simply, the bank is owed at least $121.5 million and a fire-sale of the assets would throw up more than that. The figure may be 50 cents to 80 cents in the dollar as long as the insolvency experts didn&amp;#039;t dig in for the gouge.      However, the latest published ``average variable interest rate&amp;#039;&amp;#039; on the bank debt is 11.16%. As this is an average, we can assume that it is now higher than 11.16% as this time last year City was not in breach and bank rates were lower.      Leap of faith      What are the fund&amp;#039;s assets worth?      There are 880.3 million $1 units. An impairment charge of $53 million has already been taken which gives a closing balance of $827.3 million. Strip out CBA&amp;#039;s debt of $121.5 million (it would be higher now, that was on September 25).      If impairment charges - and this is being charitable - are worth 6 cents per unit and the CBA debt is worth 14 cents per unit, then there is 80 cents per unit of value left in the fund.      We are assuming here - and this is the greatest leap of faith since the Virgin of Lourdes - that City&amp;#039;s property valuations can be trusted. And we are assuming that no more impairment charges will be taken.      Reaping      To the operations: City advertises to get peoples&amp;#039; savings into its fund then on-lends the money to either its own property development operations in the parent company and elsewhere, and to property developer associates, at a higher rate.      It makes money on the ``spread&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, apart from reaping $38 million in funds management revenue last year (at a time when the funds were frozen), it booked $23.6 million in ``rendering of financial services&amp;#039;&amp;#039;.      This spread becomes negative when you add in City Pacific&amp;#039;s management fees of the FMF. (If counting just the interest charged to developers and interest technically due to be paid unitholders, the spread remains slightly positive.)      In other words, the interest which they receive from developers is less than the 11.16% interest payable on the debt in the mortgage fund - which was $13.6 million annualised. This will hit the value of the mortgage fund too.      Looking at the debt maturity breakdown in the FMF annual report, $575.8 million was due by September 30. That was due five days later and although there is nothing published lately you can bet City could not have got its hands on even a decent fraction of that.      The biggest loan was $188.4 million to Martha Cove, a flash development on the road out of Melbourne to Portsea, and a related party.      All up, some $336.7 million of loans were past due at the end of June, which were extended by the FMF. Related party loans as of June 30 totalled $255 million.      `Past due&amp;#039;      Which brings us to the next point: capitalised interest. Instead of making interest payments every month, as you would do under a normal loan arrangement, most of the City developers don&amp;#039;t pay interest. Rather, it is added on to the principal of the loan to be paid back at the end of the term.      The question is, will it ever be paid back? City the parent company has been boasted of its profits for years but when you look through them you find they were based on revenue numbers bulked up by capitalising interest on its loans and booking it as income.      The loans are rolled over. The interest goes on top. Some are second mortgages with high-risk rates of 20% or more. So City is booking non-existent profits, though technically a legal practice, by rolling over developer loans.      That is coming home to roost, and every day this fund trades on with redemptions frozen the interest charges flow to the CBA and the capitalised interest to developers escalates.      At June 30, loans ``past due&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, or in breach, were $159.5 million and loans due that were rolled over were $336.7 million. That&amp;#039;s $496.2 million which would have been past due at the balance date had the loans not been renegotiated.      Over half of the entire loan book, in other words, would have been ``past due&amp;#039;&amp;#039; had these extensions not been made.      Piquant aromas      The sad thing is that while City is burning the savings of its small investors - now blaming the credit crunch - its executives got rich by generating supercharged profits from capitalised interest and ripping the money out via dividends in the head stock.      They should be forced to restate their profits like ABC Learning.      Even on the impairment charge, the principal was $33.3 million and the capitalised interest $19.7 million. If they didn&amp;#039;t capitalise that interest they would not have dusted that $19.7 million which, incidentally, was dusted mostly outside the Gold Coast.      Melbourne, it seems, is City Pacific&amp;#039;s nemesis.      This reporter first smelt a rat upon hearing that City was flying institutional investors down in a helicopter to visit the Martha Cove project two years ago.      Helicopters are ``tres&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Gold Coast 1980s. They throw up a piquant aroma of the flashy entrepreneur desperate to impress.      Following the helicopter ride, City last did an equity raising in the head stock via a placement to the likes of Perpetual, Dick Pratt&amp;#039;s Thorney and others in February 2007 at $4.60 a share.      They raised $80 million and it was done one week prior to the release of the interim results. The stock got promptly slammed as a large chunk of the group&amp;#039;s ``record&amp;#039;&amp;#039; interim profit was from asset revaluations. Without them profit would have fallen.      The institutions saw the writing on the wall and bailed. Still, the $80 million was in the bank and the stock was in the $3 range.      Now, the entire market cap is $25 million. This thing is gone.      Once the fund investors appoint their own administrator, CBA will go straight over the top with its own receiver. Still, the administrator is there to keep the receiver honest.      -----------------end------------------      Link:  http://business.smh.com.au/business/...e#contentSwap2
