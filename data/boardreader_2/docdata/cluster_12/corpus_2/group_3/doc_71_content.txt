Kellen Winslow&amp;#039;s appeal will be decided before Jacksonville game     by Mary Kay Cabot    Wednesday October 22, 2008, 4:44 PM     Browns tight end Kellen Winslow has appealed his one-game suspension by the Browns and an NFL spokesman said the matter has been expedited and will be decided before Sunday&amp;#039;s game against the Jaguars. One league source said they&amp;#039;re hoping the matter could be resolved by Friday.    If Winslow loses the appeal, he would sit out Sunday&amp;#039;s game in Jacksonville and forfeit his $235,294 game check. If he wins, he could be re-instated for the game and not lose his game check.        &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s a grievance proceeding under the CBA, and it&amp;#039;s expedited, meaning it will be decided by the arbitrator prior to Sunday,&amp;amp;quot; said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in an email response.      Asked if that means Winslow could conceivably play, he said, &amp;amp;quot;right.&amp;amp;quot;      Winslow and his representatives filed the appeal through the NFL Players Association, his publicist Denise White said. The union will represent Winslow and the NFL Management Council will represent the Browns in a grievance proceeding, Aiello said.      Winslow has been suspended for statements the club said were &amp;amp;quot;unwarranted, inappropriate and unnecessarily damaging to our organization.&amp;amp;quot; Winslow said Sunday night after the Redskins game that the team wanted him to keep his staph infection quiet to protect the organization. He also said other players deserved to know that he had staph so they could protect themselves.
