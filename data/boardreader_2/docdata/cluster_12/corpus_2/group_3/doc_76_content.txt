I think people should remember that there are technical reasons for opting out. So he might opt out to get on the next tier of the veteran salary scale prior to the renegotiation of the collective agreement which IIRC is in 2011. Right now, I&amp;#039;d say he expects to use the opt out - and has all along - but whether he leaves is another issue entirely that will be determined by various factors.  There&amp;#039;s one thing the media hasn&amp;#039;t figured out yet - the owners may opt out of the CBA in 2010. If the economy sucks, they&amp;#039;d probably have the leverage to exact concessions from the players on issues like the owners&amp;#039; share of revenues - which would reduce the salary cap and hence max salaries going forward. If agents see this coming, they may wish to negotiate extensions next summer rather than put the players they represent at risk of having to sign their next contracts under a new CBA.
