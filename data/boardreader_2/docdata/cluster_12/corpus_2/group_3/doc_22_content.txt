 I can&amp;#039;t access my Barclaycard account, to see if my Leeds ticket application has succeeded. Have tried day and night, last 24hrs.      It seems I&amp;#039;m not alone, others have been trying for several days ...     For example:   http://www.computerworlduk.com/techn...m?newsid=11218      quote --------------  Several customers notified ComputerworldUK that the website appeared to be down. One customer was told by Barclaycard&amp;#039;s customer service team, based in Bangalore that the site would be down for another 24 hours. Attempts by the Computerworld UK team to log on to the site resulted in an error message.   A spokesperson from Barclaycard was unable to confirm how long the issues would continue, but admitted the site had &amp;amp;quot;experienced problems&amp;amp;quot; on Monday and Tuesday this week.   The issues were resolved on Wednesday, said Barclaycard, but the the site was struggling again today due to the &amp;amp;quot;unusual amount of demand for service at the moment&amp;amp;quot;.
