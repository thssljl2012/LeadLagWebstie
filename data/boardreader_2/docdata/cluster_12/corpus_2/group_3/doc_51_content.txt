         Hi, I am looking to purchase 2-3 new high yield shares over the next month.  I usually spend approx. 1000-1500 on each purchase and own many since 2005. I like the DRIP schemes as I can accumulate shares at very little cost.  I already own Barclays Lloyds TSB United Utilities HSBC Royal and Sun Alliance CRH Vodafone BP  Independent News and Media Barrett Developments Royal Bank of Scotland GlaxoSmithKline  From all your advice here, I am looking at Anglo American, Tesco, Scottish and Southern Energy, Aviva, Logica as possible choices.  I was looking at M&amp;amp;amp;S and BT previously but am a bit dubious of these now.
