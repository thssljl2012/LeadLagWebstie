It&amp;#039;s not really a secret. Ratner&amp;#039;s plan all along was to sell off more of a stake in the Nets to Jay-Z  and  the rest of the ownership group. Ratner has no interest in owning the Nets (which is why they&amp;#039;ve been all but abandoned now) but knew he wasn&amp;#039;t getting anywhere with his massive Brooklyn land grab if there wasn&amp;#039;t a team attached to it.    _________________ &amp;quot;Commercial rap culture is now to hip-hop what disco was to funk.&amp;quot; - Paris of Guerilla Funk
