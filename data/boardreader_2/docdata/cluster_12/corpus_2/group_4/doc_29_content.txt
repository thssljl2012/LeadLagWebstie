          I still think a trim by 2009-10 is on the cards: part of the &amp;amp;quot;deleveraging realism&amp;amp;quot; movement that is sweeping FTSE100 board rooms. Every time a Carnival does it, it becomes easier for the rest to follow suit.    The lack of complaint about the Carnival suspension (possibly influenced from the US where divis do not have the same prominence as in the UK and also not yet a done deal), needs to be compared with the uproar over the cancellation of the Lloyds dividend, from both institutional and retail investors.  The determination by Barclays not to be forced into the same position suggests that there is no such &amp;amp;quot;realism&amp;amp;quot; sweeping boardrooms, quite the reverse.
