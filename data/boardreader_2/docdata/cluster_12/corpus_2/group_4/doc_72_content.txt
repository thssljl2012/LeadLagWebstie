 It&amp;#039;s big subject but briefly, a company is not obliged to make a pro-rata issue to all shareholders every time it issues new shares. There are rules to follow of course but it means that a shareholder doesn&amp;#039;t always get to keep his or her proportion of the capital.   In NAB&amp;#039;s present case, they are making a placement to institutional holders to be followed by an offer to retail shareholders of $10,000 worth of new shares, ie 500 shares each. Note that the offer is not proportional - every holder gets offered $10,000 worth.
