            Quote from: EchelonMonitor on November 06, 2008, 10:07:28 AM   I&amp;amp;#039;m not sure about the blood relations, but early on the Rothschilds understood the problems if they named all their holdings after themselves, and they began to name them after their agents.  In 1831 they formed a bank in Belgium, but named it after their agent, it becoming the Lambert bank.&amp;amp;nbsp; Lambert also married a Rothschild, just as the CEO of Barclays is married to a Rothschild.  Another of their chain of banks was named after their agent, Erlanger or d&amp;amp;#039;Erlanger (he was French.)&amp;amp;nbsp; He financed the South during the Civil War while other of their operations financed the North.&amp;amp;nbsp; Erlanger&amp;amp;#039;s son married the South&amp;amp;#039;s finance manager&amp;amp;#039;s daughter, whom he met when she came to France with her father.&amp;amp;nbsp; The son moved to the South with his wife and established railroads, hospitals and even towns across the south.  It&amp;amp;#039;s not one book about the Rothschilds, but many books and other sources you can find by searching google.com and books.google.com.  That&amp;amp;#039;s some excellent information you posted there. If you don&amp;amp;#039;t believe him, take a look at this:  http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D61E3AF932A35755C0A961948260   Quote  He was the great-grandson of Baron James de Rothschild and the great-great-grandson of Samuel Lambert, who established the family-owned Banque Lambert in 1840.  All these banking dynasties are intermarried. The most succesful people will only marry other succesful people. Ethnicity isn&amp;amp;#039;t really an issue to them. A jew will marry a non-Jew, a German a Russian. They hold no allegiance to any of our tribal groups, but only to eachother, like Rothkopf said. Also, take a look at this, major American banker Jacob Schiff, he helped finance Japan in the war between Russia and Japan:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Schiff  His daughter was called Frieda Schiff, she was married to Felix Warburg, of the influential Warburg family. The Warburgs are heavily involved in the Council of Foreign relations and the Federal Reserve:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Warburg
