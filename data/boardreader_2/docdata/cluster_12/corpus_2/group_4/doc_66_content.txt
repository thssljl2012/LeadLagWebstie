  T&amp;amp;amp;G Building (later Town Hall Chambers)                Built in 1887 for the Temperance &amp;amp;amp; General (T&amp;amp;amp;G) Assurance Society, the building on the corner of Swanston and Little Collins Streets had been one of boomtime Melbourne&amp;amp;#8217;s minor splendours.  Its two-street faade had six storeys on Swanston Street and sloped to three up Little Collins Street.  Melbourne City Council bought the T&amp;amp;amp;G Building in 1928 as an extension of its town hall offices, renaming it Town Hall Chambers.  It was demolished in 1971 to create a small temporary City Square.    One can see the northern side of the building in the Edwardian postcard below while it was still the T&amp;amp;amp;G Building.       ________________________________________________________________________    Below,   The Eastern Market  , opened 22 December 1879 and was demolished in 1960.  It was located at the south-west corner of Bourke and Exhibition Streets.

In 1924 the lease of the Collins Street premises expired and the building was vacated and later demolished to make way for an expanded Melbourne Town Hall.            ________________________________________________________________________    The   Premier Building    that stood near the south-west corner of Collins and Swanston Streets is another sad loss.            ________________________________________________________________________    A couple of the old Coffee Palaces and Cafs on Bourke Street were rather charming.      Parer&amp;amp;#8217;s Crystal Caf  .           The Melbourne Coffee Palace   and   Parer&amp;amp;#8217;s Crystal Caf   in the next two.            ________________________________________________________________________      The Oriental Bank  , built in 1857, stood on the south-west corner of Queen Street and Flinders Lane.  More like a Greek Temple than a bank.  A competition for its design was held in 1856 and won by the architects Robertson and Hale.  Neoclassical in design, it was one of the several notable and solid buildings of its time.  The Bank went under in1884 and the building was later demolished.       ________________________________________________________________________    The former   State Savings Bank of Victoria Headquarters   which stood on the south-west corner of Bourke and Elizabeth Streets.  Demolished in 1980 and replaced with what was then  The State Banking Centre , now  Commonwealth Bank Tower   in 1983.    On a wet night from Bourke Street.         Elizabeth Street view.
