                                         Quote:                   a breakout to the downside that sticks will see $30.00 with a  high degree of probability                                              Today&amp;#039;s low was $29.92 with a reasonable close at $31.22. There could be something in that. We&amp;#039;ll be taking another look later this week to see what the Elliott Wave pattern suggests from here.
