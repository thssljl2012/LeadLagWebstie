 The EW count suggests we&amp;#039;re clearly impulsing lower in what may be an extended 5-wave pattern (labeled -1 through -5) that now appears to be sub-dividing into a smaller pattern (labeled -i through -v). The correct way to trade this pattern is with the trend, so looking for the end of a wave-iv bounce and   initiating shorts with the trend   - as opposed to against it. You can see that there is no sign of a wave-iv or the end of wave-iii for that matter.
