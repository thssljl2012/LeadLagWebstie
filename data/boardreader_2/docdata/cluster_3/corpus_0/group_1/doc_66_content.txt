ABC anchor Charles Gibson attempted to represent the common man when he grilled Exxon-Mobile CEO Rex Tillerson. With profits close to $22 billion for the first half of the year alone, many feel &amp;quot;Big Oil&amp;quot; is gouging consumers. But here are some numbers that put things in perspective: $1,400 profits per second $4,000 taxes paid per second So, who is getting rich here? Stockholders like the little old ladies in Florida? Or the recipients of &amp;quot;Big Government's&amp;quot; largesse? Another way of looking at things that's been discussed around the net for a few weeks now: Exxon-Mobile had an 8.5% net profit margin for the first half of the year Disney has a 9% net profit margin over the past five years, 13.2% last year, and a 13.9% net profit margin last quarter (anyone see a trend here? That's right, Disney is raping the consumer!) Eli Lilly posted a 15.9% net profit margin over the last five years, and an 18.6% net profit margin last quarter Apple posted a 14.6% net profit margin last year Bank of America has posted a stunning 51.5% net profit margin over the last five years Chuck Gibson and the common man need to understand that large corporations mean large numbers, even in profit. 8.5% net profit isn't all that much, but because sales are in the region of $400 billion the profit numbers seem excessive to the average Joe that thinks in terms of thousands of dollars per year when he runs his household.
