The banking sector went south on Thursday thanks in part to Citigroup Inc.'s and Bank of America Corp.'s auction-rate security dilemmas. News surfaced that Citi is being forced by state and federal regulators to buy back $7 billion in auction rate securities and pay $100 million in fines as it marketed the securities as safe investments despite the bank's liquidity risks. Citi's stock slid 6.24% to close at $18.47 per share. Bank of America's stock slide 5.77% to close at $31.52 after it disclosed in its 10-Q filed Thursday that it has received subpoenas and requests for information from various state and federal regulators regarding its sale of auction-rate securities.   Other banks dragged down by the auction-rate securities muck included Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., which fell 4.02% to $172.33, and Lehman Brothers Inc., which fell 12.91% to close at $17.67.  The bears awoke in the broader market as well following two straight days of a combined 370-plus point gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 224.64 points to close at 11,431.43 due in part to a Labor Department report that new applications for unemployment last week hit its highest level in six years. - Michael Rudnick
