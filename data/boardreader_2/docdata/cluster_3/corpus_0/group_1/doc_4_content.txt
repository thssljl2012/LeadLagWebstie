                                                                                         By Lynn Adler&amp;nbsp;August 21, 2008                                                                                                                                NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Heightened expectations for a  government bailout of U.S. home-funding giants Fannie Mae  (FNM.N) and Freddie Mac (FRE.N) drove their debt prices higher  on Thursday as investors bet the securities will be guaranteed  by the U.S. government even if shareholders are wiped out.  Shares in the government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), which  own or guarantee almost half of all outstanding U.S. mortgages,  erased steep early losses to post modest gains by midday, but  remain near their lowest levels in nearly two decades.   The GSEs have reported losses for the past four quarters,  and rising mortgage delinquencies cut into the value of their  assets and capital. However, they meet regulatory capital  requirements and are successfully rolling over their debt on  the regular schedule, limiting the need for any nationalization  by the government.   The two GSEs combined finance or guarantee about half of  all U.S. home mortgages. As the nation suffers the worst  housing market downturn since the Great Depression, their  ability to fund mortgages through the issuance of debt is  considered crucial for the housing market and economy.   As the share prices evaporate, banking sector analyst Dick  Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann said the government should recruit  financial industry leaders to oversee dismantling of the two  companies.   "The only rational action" to be taken relative to Fannie  and Freddie "is to get rid of them," Bove wrote in a research  note.   The price of the debt issued by Fannie and Freddie has  surged relative to U.S. Treasuries in the past two days,  however, on the view that Congressional backing for a bailout  mandated in July this year will secure repayment.   Investors are closely watching the performance of the  companies' debt, given that the two GSEs will need to roll over  $225 billion of debt by the end of September, according to  Barclays Capital.   "If they are able to roll over their debt in late  September, and the dollar amount is substantial, then it  signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the  current situation and with the government backstop and that  buys them a fair amount of time," said Brian Gardner, chief  political analyst for Keefe, Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods.   "If that does not turn out well, then the Treasury, if they  have not already done so, will at that point be forced to step  in and act more quickly than they would have," he added.   Both agencies have demonstrated in debt sales this month  that they still have ready access to the capital markets,  albeit at a higher cost.   The ongoing ability of the GSEs to finance the purchases of  mortgage from private lenders, freeing up money for more  lending, is critical to the U.S. housing market as many of the  GSEs private competitors shut their doors after record  foreclosures on riskier loans in the past year.   A new Freddie Mac five-year note was sold on Tuesday at  record 1.13 percentage point yield premium over Treasuries. The  pricing enticed enough demand to cut that premium to 0.98  percentage points on Wednesday and about 0.89 percentage point  at midday on Thursday.   Freddie's shares tumbled more than 14 percent in early  trade on Thursday to erase more than half of their value just  this week. At midday, Freddie shares were down about 1.0  percent at $3.22 while Fannie rose more than 4.0 percent to  $4.61.   A share bounce could be expected if the government acts to  support the two largest U.S. home funding companies without  eliminating value for existing shareholders.   But the market is demanding clarity and without it the  shares are vulnerable.   "Nobody is going to put equity capital or preferred stock  into Fannie and Freddie, with 'what's the government going to  do?' hanging over your head?," said Robert Napoli, analyst  Piper Jaffray in Chicago.   One option is for the regulator of the GSEs is to waive the  requirement that Fannie and Freddie hold excess capital, he  said.    "If the government were to provide support that didn't wipe  out shareholders ... you will have another year of bad  quarters, and it then starts getting better so there's a lot of  upside potential," said Napoli. "There's that possibility out  there."    The Treasury could also take an equity stake in the  companies, buy their mortgage-backed securities or senior  agency debt, and ultimately restructure Fannie and Freddie,  analysts said.
