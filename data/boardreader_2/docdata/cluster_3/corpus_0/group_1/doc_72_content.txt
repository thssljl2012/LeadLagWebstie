Filed under: Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Wachovia Corp (WB), Lehman Br Holdings (LEH)The Wall Street Journal reports that Wachovia Corporation (NYSE: WB) is now the sixth major Auction Rate Securities (ARS) issuer to agree to buy back these long-term securities whose interest rates formerly reset in weekly auctions -- until those auctions failed in February. There seems to be a difference of opinion -- between New York's attorney general and the SEC and Missouri -- regarding the terms of Wachovia's deal. Andrew Cuomo of New York thinks Wachovia will redeem $8 billion worth of ARS in November and will pay a $50 million fine. The SEC and Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan said that Wachovia will buy back $5.7 billion by November 28th. The SEC said Wachovia will buy back an additional $3.1 billion in ARS in June 2009 according to the Journal. Wachovia seems to be leaning more to the two-step process outlined by Carnhan and the SEC. Meanwhile, today's announcement leaves unredeemed the customers from the following top 10 municipal ARS issuers (their 2007 municipal ARS totals are in parentheses):      Goldman Sachs ($4.3 B)      Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) ($3.7 B)      RBC Capital Markets ($1.2 B)      Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LEH) ($1.1 B)   I don't know what they're waiting for. Peter Cohan is President of Peter S. Cohan &amp;amp; Associates. He also teaches management at Babson College and edits The Cohan Letter. He has no financial interest in the securities mentioned.Permalink   Email this   Comments
