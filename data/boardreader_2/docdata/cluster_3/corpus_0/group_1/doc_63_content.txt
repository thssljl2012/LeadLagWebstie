Since many squeezed consumers these days do not have much surplus funds, some banks are resorting to bold tactics --- and bold type in ads --- in the battle to lure deposits, notes Grumpy Editor.Attempting to stir up action, some marketing people get carried away by devising a complicated rate and term setup with certificates of deposit.Capturing attention is a current newspaper ad with a headline that trumpets ???The Sky???s the Limit,??? then in type almost two inches high, displays an eye-grabbing 4.50 percent APY for a 17-month CD.That CD rate is considerably higher than most competition.Larger banks, such Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, for example, offer CDs at rates considerably less than that figure.But one has to read the fine print under the 4.50 percent rate offered by First Savings Bank which serves 20 communities nationwide.To take advantage of the offer, a total of four CDs with varying terms and APY rates must be opened, as explained in fine print in the ad.Thus, along with the 17-month CD at 4.50 percent, a 29-month CD at 3.40 percent, a 41-month CD at 3.80 percent and a 53-month CD at 3.95 percent are required to be opened at the same time, each with the same deposit amount with a $5,000 minimum. That means at least $20,000 total in opening four CDs with varying terms.The assorted rates, ranging from 3.40 to 4.50 percent, and odd maturities of 17, 29, 41 and 53 months certainly will confuse consumers --- and probably staffers.Perhaps the bankwill give CD openers five-year calendars to follow the four-part action to 2013.The financial institution is part of a family of banks: First Savings Bank with operations in Arizona, New Mexico, Nebraska, Texas, Nevada and South Dakota (main office in Beresford), and First National Bank in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Colorado and Illinois (with main office in Moline).
