Filed under: Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW), Merrill Lynch (MER), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Lehman Br Holdings (LEH), E*TRADE (ETFC)Now eight large brokerage firms have settled with Auction Rate Securities (ARS) investors. This afternoon Bloomberg News reports Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Deutsche Bank settled with state regulators. Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE: MER) announced another prong of its settlement earlier in the day. What are the terms of the settlement for the latest two? Bloomberg writes that "Goldman will buy back $1.5 billion of the securities and pay a $22.5 million fine. Deutsche Bank will redeem $1 billion of debt and was fined $15 million." In addition to the rogues gallery of big ARS issuers who have yet to settle, investigators are targeting medium-sized brokers -- Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW), Fidelity Investments and E*Trade Financial Corp. (NYSE: ETFC). This leaves major ARS issuers lagging behind their peers. Here are three holdouts (with their 2007 municipal ARS issuance in parentheses):      Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) ($3.7 B)      RBC Capital Markets ($1.2 B)      Lehman Brothers (NYSE: LEH) ($1.1 B)   What are they waiting for? Peter Cohan is President of Peter S. Cohan &amp;amp; Associates. He also teaches management at Babson College and edits The Cohan Letter. He has no financial interest in the securities mentioned.Permalink   Email this   Comments
