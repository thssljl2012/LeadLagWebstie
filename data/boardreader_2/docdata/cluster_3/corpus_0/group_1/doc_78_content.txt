 I drove past a WACHOVIA across the street from a WACHOVIA!WACHOVIA Charges $5 TO CASH A CHECK DRAWN ON WACHOVIA!!!They're overcharging EVERYONE.&amp;nbsp; EVEN NON CUSTOMERS.&amp;nbsp; AND WORSE THAN BANK OF AMERICA!!!&amp;nbsp; Bank of America has adapted to the 21st Century.&amp;nbsp; WACHOVIA HAS NOT.&amp;nbsp; Wachovia OVEREXPANDED, gobbled up a dozen dozen local regional national banks to become BofA's Rival and NOW they're NOT prepared to BE THAT BIG.&amp;nbsp; GET YOUR MONEY OUT OF WACHOVIA AND INTO A CREDIT UNION!!!
