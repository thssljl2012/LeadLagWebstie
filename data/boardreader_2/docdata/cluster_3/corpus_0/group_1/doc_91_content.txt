 For those that dabble in the stock market:FRE - Freddie Mac is a great steal at the moment. It almost at the 52 week low of 3.89. Interesting note, the us gov will bail both Freddie and Fannie out if needed. The thing to remember is that earnings we lower this quarter, ok in the toilet. The were that, just lower. They aren't really bleeding money as Country Wide now known as Bank of America.Also, investors are really playing the option games with both of these stocks. Meaning they are short selling stock. This further depresses the stocks.Both Fannie and Freddie aren't going anywhere. More regulations are coming, but the one thing you must remember about both of these stocks, the loans they back, sell, and service are more&amp;nbsp;stronger than&amp;nbsp;conventional bank loans. (Or so they tell me.)Anyway, it is a risk and a gamble.. buy hey... it is all like a slot machine.&amp;nbsp;
