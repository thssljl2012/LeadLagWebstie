Filed under: Bank of America (BAC), Merrill Lynch (MER), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Lehman Br Holdings (LEH)Bloomberg News reports that Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE: MER) has extended its Auction Rate Securities (ARS) redemption offer in response to what I thought was pressure from New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo who threatened to take Merrill to court. But what is interesting is that Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin was the one who announced the settlement. While the politics of this intrigue me, those who held Merrill ARSs (pun intended) care about the terms of the settlement. Bloomberg reports that Merrill "will begin the buyback on October 15 for individuals, nonprofits and small business with $3 million or less on deposit. Redemptions for clients with $100 million or less start on January 15." This Merrill deal adds to the one it announced on August 7 -- a voluntary buyback of $10 billion worth of ARS. Merrill has a total of "30,000 clients who held an estimated $12 billion" according to Bloomberg. This leaves many major ARS issuers lagging behind their peers. Here are four holdouts (with their 2007 municipal ARS issuance in parentheses):      Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) ($4.3 B)      Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) ($3.7 B)      RBC Capital Markets ($1.2 B)      Lehman Brothers (NYSE: LEH) ($1.1 B)   What are they waiting for?
