Good morning. Various housing and real estate links from here and there:  The Economist, via Patrick.net, warns about the &amp;quot;Ticking Time Bomb&amp;quot; in the American housing market -- Option ARMs, which allow homeowners to pay less than even the interest on their loans, until a day of reckoning when payments rise and ARMs often explode: &amp;quot;Delinquencies are already rising fast. Write-offs for option ARMs at Washington Mutual, a stumbling thrift, have zoomed from 0.49% in the last quarter of 2007 to 3.91% in the second quarter. But the real crunch will come when the mortgages 'recast', forcing borrowers to start making full payments.&amp;quot; Oh, and The Economist, quoting Barclays Capital, says most of these time bombs are in California.  From Calculated Risk: Single-family housing starts are at their lowest level since 1991.  If you want extra credit today, there's plenty to read about the doomed duo, Fannie and Freddie. Brad Setser explains the key role Fannie and Freddie played until recently in allowing foreign central banks to invest in the U.S. housing market -- a key source of bubble money.&amp;nbsp; And from Patrick.net, here's a link to the full Barron's article arguing Fannie and Freddie are toast.  The logic is pretty simple: to stay independent, Barron's argues, they need to raise about $10 billion each. The problem is, who's going to invest $20 billion in companies with a combined market value of just $12 billion? You know the answer, don't you? Of course you do, it's right there in front of you: You're going to invest in them, through your Treasury Department.  --Peter VilesYour thoughts? Comments?
