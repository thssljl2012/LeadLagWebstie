The spotlight is on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Monday as the government said over the weekend that it would continue to sponsor the publicly traded companies. Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac declined in midafternoon trading, with shareholders digesting the questionable fate of the two companies as their health has been seen as a barometer of the mortgage crisis.

Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Washington Mutual Inc. and Bank of America Corp., which traded down in early afternoon trading. - Gerald Magpily         Troubled financials         Share price at 1 pm July 14, 2008          &amp;nbsp;            Name     Last price     Change     Volume     Low           J.P.
