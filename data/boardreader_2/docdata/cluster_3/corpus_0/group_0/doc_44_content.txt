 Wells Fargo Profit Exceeds Estimates; Shares Jump Ha, I knew those guys wouldn't let me down.Wells Fargo &amp; Co., the biggest bank on the U.S. West Coast, reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts' estimates on record revenue, sending the shares up as much as 12 percent and buoying U.S. stock futures.I have been using Wells Fargo for years and this is the reason why. I would by their stock too but I only do the Spiders and the QQQQs. That way I never have to worry about anyone blowing up on me except the US as a whole getting nuked by the neocons. Wells Fargo, the second-biggest U.S. mortgage lender, has said it avoided subprime loans, which caused more than 100 companies to close, be sold or halt operations since the beginning of 2007. Bank of America Corp. became the biggest home lender this month when it completed a rescue of Countrywide by purchasing the Calabasas, California-based company.Wells Fargo makes their money by nickel and diming their customers like a bank should. Not like a Bank America which doesn't really want you they just want to make their money on big risky loans. You know the kind that are TOO BIG TO FAIL.
