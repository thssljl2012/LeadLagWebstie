Jerry Brown, California&amp;#8217;s attorney general, has added new accusations to a law suit against Countrywide Financial, alleging the lenders deceptive business practices included ignoring its internal underwriting guidelines and rewarding employees for selling risky home loans. &amp;#8220;These shocking new details provide further evidence of Countrywide&amp;#8217;s dangerous lending practices, which included ignoring borrowers&amp;#8217; low credit scores and rewarding employees for selling risky loans,&amp;#8221; Attorney General Brown said. &amp;#8220;In one case the company approved an adjustable rate mortgage to an 85-year-old disabled veteran with such a low credit score and high debt that he defaulted in less than six months.&amp;#8221; (Brown pictured in file photo from AP&amp;#8217;s Jeff Chiu) The new allegations are part of an amended complaint to a lawsuit Brown filed June 20 against the lender, which was taken over this month by Bank of America. Bank of America spokesman Dan Frahm said his company does not dispute the numbers in Browns latest allegations, but he said the problems reported represent a minority of Countrywides portfolio&amp;#8211; about 158,000 of 950,000 loans owned and originated by the company. Countrywide services a total 9 million loans. The percent of delinquencies and foreclosures in that part of the portfolio is much higher than other loans, Frahm said of the Countrywide loans under attack. Frahm added that BofA is cooperating with Brown&amp;#8217;s investigation and expects to correct any potential systemic problems now that it owns Countrywide.
