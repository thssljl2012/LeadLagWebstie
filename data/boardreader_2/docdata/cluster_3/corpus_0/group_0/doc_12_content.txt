source: Bloomberg  Top-rated bonds backed by Alt-A adjustable-rate mortgages may now fetch $5 to $10 less per $100 than their fixed-rate counterparts, according to JPMorgan. Some junior AAA securities tied to option ARMs, which allow borrowers to pay less than the interest they owe, may sell for $38, according to a June 27 report from Barclays Capital. The last-to-be-repaid of originally AAA rated subprime-mortgage bonds created in first half of 2007 fell last week to $45.89, a Markit ABX index suggests.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
