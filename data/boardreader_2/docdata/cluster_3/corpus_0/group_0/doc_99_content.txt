       After watching the mortgage meltdown over the past 12 months, it seems that only one bank has a managment team that knows what it is doing:&amp;nbsp; Wells Fargo.&amp;nbsp; Just take a look at the recent news reports from the major players in the mortgage lending industry and you will see what I mean.  Freddie Mac chief ignored warning signs  Indymac taken over by government  HSBC earnings down 29%  JP Morgan earnings down 53%  Bank of America earnings down 41%  But during the same time these banks were going under or fighting to stay afloat or reporting horrible earnings reports, Wells Fargo reports it will increase its dividend.&amp;nbsp; The bank still has some problems with bad loans and other issues, but nothing like the mess the other banks have made for themselves.     Stumble It!
