Shareholders of Countrywide received a whopping .1822 of a share...      Bank of America completed what I feel is a foolish purchase of Countrywide today.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure if BofA will inherit Countrywide's legal woes in CA, WA, IL, and FL.&amp;nbsp; Shareholders of Countrywide received a whopping .1822 of a share of Bank of America stock in exchange for each of their Countrywide shares.&amp;nbsp; Sucks to be a Countrywide shareholder!  In completely unrelated news, I forgot my lunch at home today and spent too much on a chef salad from Starbucks to make up for that blunder.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
