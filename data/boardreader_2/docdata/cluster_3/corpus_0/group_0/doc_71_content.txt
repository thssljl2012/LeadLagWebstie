 Atlanta Journal-Constitution (07/02/08)Bank of America Corp.'s acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp. was finalized on July 1. The buyer is now the nation's top originator and servicer of home loans, with a firm grasp on 20 percent to 25 percent of the U.S. mortgage market. The value of the all-stock deal has eroded to $2.5 billion from approximately $4 billion in January, reflecting a decline in Bank of America's share price.
