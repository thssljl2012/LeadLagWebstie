Filed under: Law, Scandals, Bank of America (BAC), Countrywide Financial (CFC)The Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee in Pittsburgh accused Countrywide Financial, the poster child for lending practices that were disastrous for both investors and consumers (but worked out quite well for Angelo Mozilo), of losing or destroying more than $500,000 in checks between December 2005 and April 2007, and then charging already downtrodden borrowers for illegitimate late fees and legal costs.Countrywide recently settled those allegations, and will pay $325,000. That's it. Is that a deterrent? Now that Countrywide is owned by Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), it's barely a rounding error, and certainly not something that will discourage Countrywide or other lenders from ripping people off.Crime might not pay, but apparently it doesn't cost much either. Given the continuing flow of hugely negative publicity for Countrywide, it's hard to imagine that Bank of America isn't rethinking its plan to keep the Countrywide brand. Why would someone go a company synonymous with foreclosures, bait and switch, and corporate greed when they want a home loan?Read   Permalink   Email this   Comments
