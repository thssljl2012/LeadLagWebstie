Standing alongside representatives of Bank of America and Washington Mutual, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sought to strengthen financial institutions by issuing "Best Practices for Residential Covered Bonds," a move some hope will make it easier for banks to borrow money.  Hold on. We have that wrong. It turns out that Washington Mutual, which is the one of the only two issuers of covered bonds in the United States, didn't get its place in the spotlight today. Instead, Paulson was surrounded by Bank of America (the other issue of covered bonds), JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Did someone just forget to invite Washington Mutual to the party? Or does the impending doom of Washington Mutual make them an awkward guest at the party?
