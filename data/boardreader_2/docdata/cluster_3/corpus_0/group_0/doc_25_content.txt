Lehman Brothers Inc. shares continue to sink as rumors about the stability of the bank continue. On Thursday the firm's shares sank to their lowest levels in more than eight years after rumors that money manager Pimco was pulling its money out of Lehman. Pimco denied those rumors. ` "There's a concentrated effort to break Lehman,'' Richard Bove, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann &amp; Co., said in an interview with Bloomberg. "And I can't say it won't work because it worked with Bear.'' A peak at the rabble babble floating around the Internet message boards may prove Bove's statement isn't apocryphal. (Warning, this rabble babble does contain rumors, and we over at The Deal have had a few comments about rumors.)From the Yahoo! message board:b2btrillion said: "GOLDMAN SACHS acquiring LEHMAN for $22.25 ??? Anyone hearing it on the street imho" Cornmaster2 said: "Wise people will pull their accounts today. Don't you see? It is tanking and tanking fast. Even if you get your money back, it will take years in the courts."  bybeast2002 said: "LEHMAN IS STILL LEVERAGED AT 25 TO 1! 'LEVERAGED BROTHERS' IS TOAST!"  MrBiggins1 said: "I PULLED ALL OF MY ACCOUNTS FROM LEHMAN. MY REP SAID ALOT OF PEOPLE WERE " Theubiquito said : "I wonder if it will trade on Monday?" From the Google Message Board:&amp;nbsp;shahxja said: "Looks like a slide to $13.50 by EOD. Lehman has practically lost &gt;80% of its value this year, it is imploding. The short sellers are winning."  Wizardofwallstreet: this is looking just like bs..and fre and fnm Openwa said: "I can't believe how many people try to manipulate this stock. I saw a $2 crystal ball prediction...are you kidding me. People that short at $15 and change deserve to loose their money."  Dab said: "I have come to the conclusion with Lehman's recent $4 billion sell off to their own hedge fund, the profit expectations cut, and they still have a large write downs coming in the next 6 months, including their alternative investments, their mortgage backed securities....Lehman is on its way out, Barclays offering $16-17 a share is a pretty solid offer." So if you think only the press is rumormongering, then you haven't peered into the message boards. - Maria Woehr          Troubled Wall Street      Share prices at 1:30 pm July 11, 2008            Name     Open     Last price     Change     Mkt cap           J.P.
