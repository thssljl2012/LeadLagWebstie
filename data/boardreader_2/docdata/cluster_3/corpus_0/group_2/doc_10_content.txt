           Monday, September 15th: On the day where the poo hits the fan John McCain states that the "fundamentals of our economy are strong."Tuesday, September 16th: John McCain calls for a high-level economic commission to deal with the crisis.Wednesday, September 17th, AM: John McCain announces that he is against a bailout of insurance giant AIG.Wednesday, September 17th, PM: John McCain supports bailout of insurance giant AIG.Thursday, September 18th: McCain calls for the firing of SEC Chief Christopher Cox.Friday, September 19th-Tuesday, September 23rd AM: McCain blames Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae lobbyists for current financial crisis.Tuesday, September 23rd, PM: McCain suddenly becomes quiet about blaming Freddie Mac lobbyists when it is extensively reported that his own campaign manager was paid by the company as recently as last month.Wednesday, September 24th, AM: Presidential tracking polls show Barack Obama opening up his lead on John McCain.  Fox News tracking poll has Obama at +6.At 8:30 in the morning McCain is contacted by Obama with a proposal to release a joint statement of shared principals concerning the economic crisis.Sometime during the day McCain held a decidedly non-emergency meeting with Lady Lynn de Rothschild to discuss...perhaps drapery for the non-elitist White House.  Obama waits by the phone.Around 2:30 in the afternoon, McCain calls Obama to tell him he is on board with the joint statement.A few minutes later he announces to the world that he is "suspending" his campaign to deal with the crisis in Washington.  He suggests that this Friday's debate be postponed.Obama rejects McCain's request to suspend the debate.Sometime late in the evening, CNN reports that the McCain camp has suggested that the 1st presidential debate should take the place of the VP debate to be held next Thursday.  McCain surrogate answers question about McCain's VP choice with a "Sarah who?" (OK, I made that last part up.)AND CUT!!!While I may shop there, I have no desire to live in the sort of Banana Republic that would come about should this dangerously unfit man be elected to the highest office in the land.I should say that it's nice that the man has finally decided to show up for work this year.I should also say that even though McCain's decision-making skills resemble those of a man who is highly medicated, and even though I think that this is a snap decision that completely politicizes the process more than it already was, McCain is the major player on the passage of this bill.  There is no way on god's green earth that a Democratic-led Congress is going to let a bill pass without McCain's "yea" attached to it right along side Obama's "yea" vote (or no to no), because we all know that no matter what the man believes, says, or does in the time between now and the actual vote, if he breaks from Obama, that will be the centerpiece of his campaign from here on out (he could actually use this power for good, but...).   The man is that cynical, that deranged, and that unfit for duty (and judging by the way in which he handled Obama's proposal today, he's that much of a lying coward/bad-actor).  At this point it doesn't matter what he believes so long as he can make a case that it is somehow different from whatever position Obama ends up taking.Now that's some America-firsting we can believe in my friends.
