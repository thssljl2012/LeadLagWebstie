Today, as three major institutions fail (Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and AIG), and the world-wide markets plunge, an economic advisor to McCain writes an editorial arguing STILL that there is nothing wrong with the economy and times are good.He points out that banks fail all the time. Well, maybe mom-and-pop local banks fail all the time - but 158-year-old institutions like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, and a WORLD-WIDE insurance giant like AIG? Even Alan Greenspan - a Republican and friend of McCain (but perhaps one of the few intellectually honest ones?) - is calling this a "once-in-a-century" financial calamity.Meanwhile, McCain ALSO is STILL saying EVEN TODAY, "the fundamentals of the economy are strong."Come on, Barack. These guys are just making it TOO easy. Just boil all this down to one, simple attack ad and play it and play it and play it:"Alan Greenspan calls this a once-in-a-century financial crisis. But McCain STILL says even today there is no crisis, and has no plan to deal with the economy."Case closed.McCain/Palin - "That's not more of the same. That's worse."
