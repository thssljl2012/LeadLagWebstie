         glass-steagallgramm-leach-blileythe first pair sponsored a bill back in the 30's that regulated separation between banking, securities and insurance businesses, which worked for 60+ years, and never let us down.the second trio sponsored a bill back in the 90's that erased that restriction, which worked for all of about 6+ years, and it's led us into yet another good ol' '29-style financial meltdown, which was why, coincidentally, glass and steagall had written their first bill in the first place.here's where we are today:  since a lot of banks (like wamu) wrote a passel of sub-prime mortgages (like the ones turning into the record number of foreclosures in your town this year) to be bundled into securities by a lot of investment firms (like bear stearns, lehman brothers and merrill lynch), and insured by a lot of insurance companies (like aig), the american taxpayer is on the hook for carl sagan's "billions and billions" of financial liability, while the senior bankers and stock brokers and insurers have all pocketed their ill-gotten gains and left their shareholders to twist in the wind.does the name gramm ring a bell?  yup, he's john mccain's senior financial advisor.  oh, and, not by coincidence, john mccain was also one of the major supporters of gramm's bill when it got passed a few years back.  but, trust him, today he's in favor of strong regulation.can you spell k-e-a-t-i-n-g ???i tried counting to 10, but i only got to 5 and i had to start all over again.
