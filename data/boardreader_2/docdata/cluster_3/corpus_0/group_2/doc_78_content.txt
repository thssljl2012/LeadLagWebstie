We talked the other day about the US Government&amp;#8217;s takeover of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and financial disaster stories have continued on Wall Street.&amp;nbsp; In the past few days you have no doubt read about the failure of Lehman Brothers, the fire sale of Merrill Lynch and one that hasn&amp;#8217;t attracted as much attention but that is potentially a bigger deal than both these, the problems at insurance company AIG.&amp;nbsp; Reports this morning suggest that attempts to &amp;#8220;save&amp;#8221; that particular company aren&amp;#8217;t going well:  The Federal Reserve is considering participating in a $75 billion emergency financing package for the American International Group, people briefed on the matter said, in an apparent reversal of its refusal to bail out the sickly insurance giant.&amp;nbsp; Fed officials were still meeting with A.I.G., JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and others at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Tuesday morning to discuss possible options. It isn&amp;#8217;t clear that any solution, including one involving government money, will emerge, this person said.   If a financing solution is not reached, A.I.G. may file for bankruptcy as soon as Wednesday, a person briefed on the matter said Monday night. The company has hired the law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges  which is also handling the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy  to draw up bankruptcy papers.  So what&amp;#8217;s going on?&amp;nbsp; Well, most analysts agree that the current crisis represents a failure of prudential controls within the United States, a point even Peter Costello made at his book launch yesterday.&amp;nbsp; Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich writes on his blog that it all begins with a failure of trust, that &amp;#8220;[f]inancial markets trade in promises&amp;#8212;that assets have a certain value, that numbers on a balance sheet are accurate, that a loan carries a limited risk. If investors stop trusting the promises, Wall Street can&amp;#8217;t function.&amp;#8221;  He goes onto to say that,  ...when the market was roaring a few years back, many financial players had no idea what they were buying or selling. Worse, they didn&amp;#8217;t care. Derivatives on derivatives, SIVs, credit default swaps (watch this one!), and of course securities backed by home loans. There seemed no limit to the leverage, the off-balance sheet liabilities, and what credit rating agencies would approve by issuers who paid them to.   [There was] almost no limit to what was promised. Regulators&amp;#8212;Alan Greenspan in particular&amp;#8212;looked the other way.  The only way out of the mess is, according to Reich, to address this basic failure: &amp;#8220;If what&amp;#8217;s lacking is trust rather than capital, the most important steps policymakers can take are to rebuild trust. And the best way to rebuild trust is through regulations that require financial players to stand behind their promises and tell the truth, along with strict oversight to make sure they do.&amp;#8221;   The US Treasury is now talking in these terms, about the need to increase prudential controls, though, of course, not everyone agrees it is the way to go, or at least, that the sorts of controls introduced have to be carefully considered.&amp;nbsp; Nonetheless, such intervention is almost inevitable and it is something we will keep an eye on as we go along.&amp;nbsp; And as Malcolm Maiden points out: &amp;#8220;The paradox at play now is that the world markets face significant short-term pain from a purge that US regulators appear to now believe is necessary for the market&amp;#8217;s long-term health.&amp;#8221;
