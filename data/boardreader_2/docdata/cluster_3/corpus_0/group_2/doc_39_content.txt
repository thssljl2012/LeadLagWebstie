(sorry for the late post!) Today I Learned&amp;#8230; &amp;#8230;that the Fed (and then by extension the federal government) is bailing out insurance giant AIG. This makes the third huge financial firm that has floundered and changed ownership/declared bankruptcy within the past few days, including Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. Is anyone else terrified? Vote Obama? I don&amp;#8217;t even know if that would help. Are we just screwed?
