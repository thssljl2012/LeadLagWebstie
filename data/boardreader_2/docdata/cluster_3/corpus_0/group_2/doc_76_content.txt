John McCain has told, or approved, so many lies that the ladies of The View asked him to his face how he could lie like that. Now McCain is attempting one of the most astonishing reversals in political history. His campaign as an &amp;#8220;outsider who will change Washington&amp;#8221; is a laughable joke from the man who bragged about voting with George Bush over 90% of the time. But his latest reversal is a complete repudiation of his legislative history and the actions of his buddy and economic adviser Phil Gramm. The Washington Post summarizes McCain&amp;#8217;s reversal in its headline and article McCain Embraces Regulation After Many Years of Opposition:  A decade ago, Sen. John McCain embraced legislation to broadly deregulate the banking and insurance industries, helping to sweep aside a thicket of rules established over decades in favor of a less restricted financial marketplace that proponents said would result in greater economic growth. Now, as the Bush administration scrambles to prevent the collapse of the American International Group (AIG), the nation&amp;#8217;s largest insurance company, and stabilize a tumultuous Wall Street, the Republican presidential nominee is scrambling to recast himself as a champion of regulation to end &amp;#8220;reckless conduct, corruption and unbridled greed&amp;#8221; on Wall Street. Is McCain believable anymore? On anything?
