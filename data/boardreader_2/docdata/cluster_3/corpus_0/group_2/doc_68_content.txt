  Oh, word? The Washington Post says different. McCain had joined with other Republicans to push through landmark legislation sponsored by then-Sen.Phil Gramm(Tex.), who is now an economic adviser to his campaign. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to make the country&amp;#8217;s financial institutions competitive by removing the Depression-era walls between banking, investment and insurance companies. That bill allowed AIG to participate in the gold rush of a rapidly expanding global banking and investment market. But the legislation also helped pave the way for companies such as AIG andLehman Brothersto become behemoths laden with bad loans and investments. McCain now condemns the executives at those companies for pursuing the ambitions that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made possible, saying that &amp;#8220;in an endless quest for easy money, they dreamed up investment schemes that they themselves don&amp;#8217;t even understand.&amp;#8221;
