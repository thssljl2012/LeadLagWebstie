I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for the Lehman stories to appear. It&amp;#8217;s Sunday, after all. But I was not expecting Merrill Lynch to go down too. There is no bailout this time. Instead we see the blackest hole yet. Who needs a Large Hadron Collider? Craig R. Smith provides some perspective on how this happened, and what might happen next. It&amp;#8217;s not pretty. Update: Merrill has been bought out by Bank of America. Apparently Lehman will be liquidated tomorrow. Incredible. Update 2: Insurance giant AIG is also in dire trouble. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll take an Ambien tonight.
