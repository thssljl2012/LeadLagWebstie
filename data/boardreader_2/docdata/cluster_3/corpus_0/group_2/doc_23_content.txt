For those of you that have not seen the news lately, American Insurance Group (AIG), which is one of the largest insurance companies in the country, and one of the biggest insurers of bank loans, including mortgages, has announced that if they don't come up with about $40,000,000,000 (40 BILLION), then they will have to declare bankruptcy, which means what to us? 1) Banks will be forced to self insure 2) Banks will be forced to call the notes - in other words, you have to pay all of what you owe back to the bank, forget about the monthly payments 3) more jobs lost 4) the economy will worsen, when we all thought that was not possible So what does our wonderful Government do?&amp;nbsp; They decided that they will loan AIG up to $85 BILLION to bail them out, and guess how they will get the money back - from the TAXPAYERS And John McCain recently announced that he thought this was a GOOD IDEA, after he has been running on a campaign where he said he will lower taxes YEAH, SOMEONE ELSE SCREWS UP, AND WE PAY THE PRICE!! I see a lot more blue states possibly by the next projection at the end of September - let's keep our fingers crossed...
