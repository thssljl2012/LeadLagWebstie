&amp;quot;Our economy -- I think still, the fundamentals of our economy are strong -- but these are very, very difficult times...&amp;quot;...were the words of Senator John McCain, uttered on a day which saw a U.S. company which had survived the Great Depression file bankruptcy; another war horse companyy being bought out by Bank of America for what amounts to a pittance; the U.S. Stock market take a frightening dive of 500 points; and saw insurance giant AIG begin it's desent into bankruptcy, something that may result in millions of americans losing their insurance.THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR ECONOMY ARE STRONG?!!!!!!This convinces me that John McCain is so far out of touch with reality that I actually have begun to question his mental fitness to be president of the U.S.&amp;nbsp; Putting him in the White House&amp;nbsp;could possibly the biggest mistake ever made.Oh, and by the way, McCain believes the Titanic had just a tiny hole and will be quite fine in the end.
