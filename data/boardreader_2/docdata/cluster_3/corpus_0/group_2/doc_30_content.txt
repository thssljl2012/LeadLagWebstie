    Afternoon everybodyI know it's been a few days (at least I think it hasmay be a week or so) since I wrote a blog.&amp;nbsp; Partly because I had blogged myself out during the democrat convention week, and partly because business has picked up, but today I have a couple of things that I just have to blog about.&amp;nbsp; The first thing being discussed in this blog is about our "fundamentally strong economy".&amp;nbsp;   I imagine that most of you heard about what happened to both Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers yesterday and just today I heard that AIG (insurance company) received a loan from the feds just to save them.&amp;nbsp; Three big banking, investment, and insurance companies all plummeting to their death and boy did this come out of nowhere.&amp;nbsp; With Merrill Lynch being bought by Bank of America it appears that the rich are still getting richer in this poorish (don't think that's a word) economy that some people (cough, cough  not going to mention any names) feel is still sound.&amp;nbsp; Are you kiddin me?&amp;nbsp; I guess not.&amp;nbsp; Now seriously, how gullible do they think people really are? I know with some people you can hold a black shirt in front of their eyes and tell them it's red and they will believe it but I ain't one of those people.&amp;nbsp; When do those people finally open their eyes to the truth?  Those same people who sat there and voted for Bush a second time knowing that he was going to continue his "war on terror" in Iraq and to this day can't look you in the eye and admit that they voted for Bush?&amp;nbsp; I tell you what, I can vote for Obama tomorrow, and if he messes things up I can still look you in the eye 4 years from now and tell you, hey I voted for him.&amp;nbsp;   I keep seeing people ask the dumb question of "how did our economy end up this way?"&amp;nbsp; It doesn't take a rocket scientist to answer that question.&amp;nbsp; We spent trillions of dollars to finance that war in Iraq which slowly but surely killed our economy these past 8 years while George W. Bush sat in Washington and continued to tout that our economy was strong and that it was getting stronger all the while people were losing their jobs and while some of the biggest companies in America had to file for bankruptcy or just implode.&amp;nbsp; Then there was Monday when John McCain, knowing what happened with two major banking companies decided to make, yet again, his dumbest statement since saying he'd like to be in Iraq for a hundred years.&amp;nbsp; What did he say?&amp;nbsp; While stammering he said that the economy is still fundamentally strong.&amp;nbsp; Man give me a break.&amp;nbsp; Look I didn't say anything about the ignorant interview that Sarah Palin had, and really I've let a lot of things go from the lying of the republican party but now enough is enough.&amp;nbsp; This economy is in shambles.&amp;nbsp; When Clinton got out the republicans wanted soooo badly to crown a president that was better than the adulteress Clinton that they got Bush, through scamming, and well let's see  He managed to start a war, abandon an American city after a natural disaster, and well now he's ignoring our economy  STILL.&amp;nbsp;   I think there's a difference between being ignorant and being stubborn.&amp;nbsp; I seen a poll not to long ago that showed that if this election was held to voter 18  35 that Obama wins 3 to 1.&amp;nbsp; 18  50 it drops to 2  1.&amp;nbsp; After that we get what we have now  a tie.&amp;nbsp; Is this election really about the issues that matters to Americans?&amp;nbsp;   These same people heard a man earlier state that he did not know much about the American economy but that the economy was fundamentally sound all the while people were getting laid off their job because of shrinking budgets.&amp;nbsp;   These same people, people like Mitt Romney who campaign viciously against John McCain and accused McCain of knowing nothing about the economy, laughed when he heard the clip of John McCain knowing nothing about the economy stood up today on CNN and said that McCain is the most qualified of anybody in the presidential or vice president contest because he's been in the senate 26 years (meaning that he's been through all kinds of ups and downs in the economy) and then had the nerve to say that McCain has a plan  what a joke, and please don't tell me by fundamentals you meant the "American workers". &amp;nbsp;If you meant the American workers you would have said that.&amp;nbsp; Man I tell you what, some of y'all better wake up and do it in a hurry.&amp;nbsp; It's just strange because these same people accused Obama of talking nothing but hot air but let's seewhen both the presidential and vice presidential candidate of these people spew nothing but hot air, LIES, and more LIES then they have a plan.&amp;nbsp; Biggest load BS I've heard this whole campaign.&amp;nbsp; Look man our economy needs fixing big time.&amp;nbsp; I have my own business and work on my own time but there are a whole lot of other people out there that have to rely on a good economy.&amp;nbsp; If we continue at the rate that we are continuing in we will be like those third world countries where everybody is a merchant just trying to make enough to have a little bread to put on the table.
