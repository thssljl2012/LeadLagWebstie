This has been primarily a personal and technical blog - but this morning I simply have to vent at the idiotic statement from Republican John McCain concerning AIG. From Bloomberg: Republican presidential nominee John McCain said the U.S. government should let American International Group Inc. fail to prevent the financial burden from being placed on taxpayers. &amp;#8220;I think you have to, but I also know that there are great efforts being made to try to raise sufficient capital to keep AIG in business,&amp;#8221;&amp;#8216; McCain said in an interview with CNBC from Miami. Taxpayers shouldn&amp;#8217;t be held responsible for the bad performance of U.S. institutions, and &amp;#8220;the moral-hazard issue is something that we have to take head-on,&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; he told the cable news channel. Okay, this is just pandering to populist anger. Unlike the failures at investment banking houses, a collapse of AIG would hurt the &amp;#8220;average joe taxpayer&amp;#8221; harder than any other demographic. I&amp;#8217;ve been a fan of Jim Cramer since working with thestreet.com in its earliest days, and Jim, among many others, emphasizes that AIG must not fail. You see, AIG may be a huge firm, but it touches all of us. AIG insures the cars, homes, and retirement for an incredibly huge number of American taxpayers. AIG provides life insurance for a lot of those taxpayers. AIG has been a powerful player in small business and professional liability insurance. Their aggresive marketing and pricing has made personal and business insurance much more affordable. The collapse of AIG will devastate small business, professional groups, and individuals concerned enough about their future that they invest in AIG products. Savvy shoppers and business owners checked the rating services prior to committing to AIG. The rating services failed us. The regulators failed us. And yes, the AIG board failed us. But the true moral hazard here is that the Republican party pushed deregulation for thirty years. We certainly needed less regulation, but not the complete abandonment of responsible governance we have seen. A few months ago, I read &amp;#8220;The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism&amp;#8221; by John Bogle (recommendation courtesy of Bill Moyers). Certainly, the founder of the Vanguard Group is no liberal - so this book is no paean to the Democrats. I hope that both candidates take some time to read it. And so should you! We - as in &amp;#8220;We The People&amp;#8221; - have a responsibility to help AIG get through the next few months. The only group that will feel the collapse of AIG is the American taxpayer. If the fat-cats at Bear Sterns can get a bail-out, surely a champion of small business, personal responsibility, and marketplace-driven insurance deserves no less. The only ones who will profit from AIG&amp;#8217;s collapse are the well-healed insurance and investment sharks that aren&amp;#8217;t AIG&amp;#8217;s customers.
