NEW YORK (AFP) - Lehman Brothers ONE OF THE WORLDS LARGEST INVESTMENT BANKS declared itself bankrupt Monday and Wall Street rival Merrill Lynch had to be taken over in a new financial earthquake that sent global markets into a slump. The US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England injected tens of billions of dollars into money markets after the fall of the banking titans under the weight of the massive financing of bad loans. Lehman Brothers said it would file for bankruptcy on Monday after a frantic weekend of negotiations failed to arrange a rescue. In the fallout, Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch in a 50 billion dollar deal, insurance giant AIG was reported to have sought a massive emergency loan to head off its own crisis and a group of banks set up a 70 billion dollars global emergency fund. Last-ditch efforts to find a buyer collapsed Sunday. A London source at British bank Barclays said it walked away from negotiations because of concerns it would have to guarantee the 158-year-old US firm's trading commitments. Bank of America said it was buying Merrill Lynch for 50 billion dollars in a transaction that creates the world's largest financial services company.  The acquisition gives Bank of America the largest brokerage in the world with more than 20,000 advisers and 2.5 trillion dollars in client assets. Analysts expected Lehman's bankruptcy to hit a range of companies dealing with the Wall Street giant and could worsen the global credit crunch. In a related action, a consortium of 10 global commercial and investment banks announced plans to provide 70 billion dollars to help offset a credit squeeze.
