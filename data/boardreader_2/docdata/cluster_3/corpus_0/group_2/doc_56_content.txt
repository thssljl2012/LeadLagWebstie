Phil Gramm (Tex.), who is now an economic adviser to his campaign. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to make the country's financial institutions competitive by removing the Depression-era walls between banking, investment and insurance companies.

McCain now condemns the executives at those companies for pursuing the ambitions that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made possible, saying that &amp;quot;in an endless quest for easy money, they dreamed up investment schemes that they themselves don't even understand.&amp;quot;&amp;quot; (tags: politics economic-crisis markets crash election liars)
