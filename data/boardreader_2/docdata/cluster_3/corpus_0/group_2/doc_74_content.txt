Ten years ago John McCain championed deregulation in the banking and insurance industries.  Well, we're all seeing now how his poor judgment is panning out, with insurance giant AIG the latest financial titanic to be nationalized. The cost to us as taxpayers is potentially staggering.  Now McCain says regulation is necessary. Too bad for us that he didn't think so ten years ago. Too bad for him that we remember!  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26749280/
