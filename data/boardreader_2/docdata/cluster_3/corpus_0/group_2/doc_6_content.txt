  You never would have known that it was the weekend with all of the financial news.  Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Bank of America announced plans to buy Merrrill Lynch.  Here's the bad news for Lehman Brothers:  Lehman Brothers, fourth largest investment firm, filed for bankruptcy, after Barclays pulled out of an 11th-hour rescue, becoming the largest financial firm to fail in the global credit crisis, after federal officials refused to help other companies buy the venerable investment bank.  Traders fear that the collapse of Lehman would send shockwaves around the world and spark a global sell-off of shares.  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, founded in 1850, was a diversified, global financial-services firm. It is active in investment banking, equity and fixed-income sales, research and trading, investment management, private equity, and private banking.  And the good news for Merrill Lynch:   Bank of America has agreed to buy intestment bank Merrill Lynch for 50 billion dollars in a transaction that creates the world's largest financial services company, the bank announced early Monday.  John Thain, chairman and CEO of Merrill Lynch, said he looked forward to working with Bank of America to create "what will be the leading financial institution in the world."  It's going to be an interesting Monday on Wall Street.
