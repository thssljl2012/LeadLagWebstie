       Corporate taxes show $0 income.  Still had to pay $800 minimum California tax.  Plus $59 penalty for failure to send estimated tax earlier in the year.   After picking up the corporate return from my CPA in Roseville and paying $200 for his services, I rushed to the post office and made the extension deadline with just minutes to spare.  That was close! What a day&amp;#8230;  The financial news: THE MELTDOWN:  NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) &amp;#8212; Wall Street was a vastly different world Monday from what it looked like just days earlier, following one of the most harrowing days in the history of U.S. financial industry. Just a day earlier, Lehman Brothers, one of the nation&amp;#8217;s oldest investment banks, filed for bankruptcy - the largest ever announced in the United States. And Bank of America executed a bold and swift $50 billion takeover of Merrill Lynch, while the fate of other brand-name financial institutions remained in doubt. Anxiety was palpable in the financial community all day Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average suffered a painful selloff, falling more than 500 points - its worst decline in more than seven years.  Lehman Brothers is the World&amp;#8217;s Biggest Bankruptcy!  AIG, the biggest insurance company is not doing so good either: AIG: Pressure mounts with downgrades: Nation&amp;#8217;s largest insurer hit by credit raters as it tries to raise cash. Fed asks Goldman and JPMorgan Chase to raise $70 billion for firm. Shares end down 61%. NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) &amp;#8212; The pressure on American International Group reached fevered pitch on Monday night as the troubled insurer was hit by a series of credit rating downgrades. The cuts could prove deadly to AIG, the nation&amp;#8217;s largest insurance company, which is scrambling to raise much-needed capital. Craaazinessss! Two words.  Got gold? Oh, yeah today is my last day at my parents house! Moving into a hotel tonight.  Need my own space in order to keep moving forward. Also, check out a few birthday pics from 5 days ago. Tomorrow is the long awaited GSPG 43-101 report.  I decided to not go to San Francisco to watch it live.  Will see it online instead. Can&amp;#8217;t wait.
