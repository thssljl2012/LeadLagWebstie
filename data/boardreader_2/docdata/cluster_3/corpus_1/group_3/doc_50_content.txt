LONDON (MarketWatch) -- U.K. Chancellor Alistair Darling said Monday that the government and the Bank of England will do whatever is necessary to strengthen capital and ensure liquidity for banks, but he stopped short of announcing any concrete rescue plans for the sector. Darling's comments came after more European countries, including Germany, Denmark and Iceland moved to guarantee customers' deposits, following Ireland's move last week. In a statement to parliament, Darling refused to follow suit, arguing that European authorities must act together to come up with a solution, and that the actions of Ireland and Germany are having a knock-on effect on other countries. 'Each country needs to do whatever is needed to deal with its own particular circumstances. However, I also believe that wherever it is possible to do so, countries should work and act together to maintain stability,' Darling said. He added that all practical options remain open to stabilize the sector and European authorities are looking at the issues of liquidity, capital and regulation. He is due to meet with other European finance ministers on Tuesday. 'The government stands ready -- with the resources and the commitment -- to do whatever is necessary,' Darling said. He argued it would be 'irresponsible' to talk about specifics until a plan is in place. But reports earlier Monday suggested the likely plan is to use taxpayers' money to recapitalize struggling banks. That could mean providing billions of pounds of new capital to banks in exchange for preferred shares or warrants, the Financial Times reported Monday. Those shares could include generous future dividends to repay the investment -- mirroring a successful operation by the Swedish government in the early 1990s, the newspaper added. Shares in the U.K. banking sector tumbled Monday after European leaders failed to agree any bailout plan over the weekend and as further rescue packages for Fortis (BE:000380118: news, chart, profile) and Hypo Real Estate (DE:802770: news, chart, profile) were required.  Among the biggest fallers, Royal Bank of Scotland (UK:RBS: news, chart, profile) (RBS:RBSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) closed down 20.5% and Barclays (UK:BARC: news, chart, profile) (BCS:BCSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) ended trading 14.7% lower. Darling had come under pressure to guarantee bank deposits, especially after Germany's move.  But he said the move by the Financial Services Authority on Friday to lift the amount of protection per customer to 50,000 pounds from 35,000 pounds means 98% of accounts are fully covered. The U.K. deposits market totaled roughly 860 billion pounds ($1.51 trillion) around the end of last year, according to a Financial Services Authority review of compensation funding -- that's reportedly almost twice as much as the German guarantee will cover. Iceland debates rescue Another country scrambling for a solution to the banking sector turmoil is Iceland, which also joined the list of countries to guarantee deposits Monday. Iceland's government is continuing emergency talks over other measures and reportedly wants pension funds to repatriate assets to help rescue the banking industry and stem a decline in its currency.  With the talks still continuing, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority on Monday suspended trading in financial stocks including Kaupthing Bank (KPBIF:KPBIFNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , Glitnir Bank and Landsbanki Islands. It said the decision would 'safeguard the equality of investors while awaiting an announcement.' The International Monetary Fund has also sent a fact-finding team to Iceland, according to a Dow Jones Newswires report. Simon Kennedy is the City correspondent for MarketWatch in London.
