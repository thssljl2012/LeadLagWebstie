Shares in Halifax owner HBOS dived 9% today after the price of its takeover by Lloyds TSB was slashed in half to around 6bn.HBOS shareholders will now get just 0.605 shares for every HBOS share they own - down from the 0.833 they were to get when the deal was announced last month.Taking into account shares issued by both banks to the Government today, the deal is now worth just 6bn against 12.2bn a month ago.HBOS shares fell 10.8p to 113.4p while Lloyds TSB was up 20p to 209p.The banks also said that the HBOS chairman Lord Stevenson and chief executive Andy Hornby would leave the combined group once the deal is completed - joining outgoing Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin among the most high-profile victims of the banking crisis.Hornby, once seen as the golden boy of British banking, leaves with a year's pay worth 1.9m.The takeover, orchestrated by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, was revised after HBOS shares tumbled and both banks went cap in hand to the Government for funds. HBOS is to raise 11.5bn from the taxpayer while Lloyds TSB raised 5.5bn.The need to raise money from the Government plunged the takeover into doubt but talks over the weekend pushed it through. An HBOS spokesman said: 'The deal is done, the ink is dry.'If neither Lloyds TSB nor HBOS shareholders take part in the clawback related to their fundraisings with the Government, existing Lloyds TSB shareholders will own 36.5% of the enlarged group, HBOS shareholders 20% and the Treasury 43.5%.The banks confirmed the combined group will keep the HBOS headquarters in Edinburgh, continue to hold its annual meetings in Scotland and carry on printing Bank of Scotland banknotes.The combined group will have a core tier one capital ratio 'in excess' of 8.5%.
