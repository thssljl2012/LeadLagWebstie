The UK's biggest banks gathered stock market momentum amid revived hopes of a revamped 700 billion US dollar (392 billion) financial salvage plan.Expectations of Congressional approval for a deal in the US saw Halifax Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB all gain ground as the FTSE 100 Index lifted 1.5%.HBOS was 4% higher after a 14% fall on Tuesday as traders cast further doubt over the terms of its rescue takeover by Lloyds TSB.Despite HBOS's modest recovery, its shares have fallen almost 30% below the point at which the bank's rescue takeover by Lloyds TSB was announced less than two weeks ago.Under the terms of the deal, Lloyds TSB will pay 0.83 of its own shares - currently equivalent to 195p - for each HBOS share, which is trading around the 125p mark.The wide gap between these two figures implies that the market is dubious about the prospects of a deal on the current terms, as Lloyds TSB shareholders, who have to approve the takeover, may not be keen to pay such a big premium for struggling HBOS.David Buik of BGC Partners said it was 'surely nonsense' to suggest a deal would not be done.'Perhaps the price may be altered, and maybe Lloyds TSB will need to sell Scottish Widows to make room, but the deal must stand. Failure to consummate would be viewed as horrific for the market,' he said.The wider FTSE 100 Index was also buoyed by commodity stocks such as oil and mining firms, as the hopes for a rescue of creaking US financial firms staved off fears of a demand slump in a global economic meltdown.Crude oil, which had been trading below 100 US dollars a barrel on Tuesday, rose to almost 102 dollars a barrel overnight although some experts remained sceptical over whether the package would be enough to arrest a deepening slowdown.Editor's choiceThe Bradford &amp;amp; Bingleys interim communications manager has spoken of his devastation after his brother was killed when he tried to break up a gang attack in the street.Three teenage girls who were victims of paedophile Philip Davey have spoken out about their ordeals.Two Bradford detectives are being rewarded for their hard work and dedication in bringing difficult cases to a successful conclusion.Bradford pupils are to make a appearance alongside top chef Jamie Oliver in his new TV series Jamies Ministry of Food which started last night.Three men are being questioned in connection with the murder of a banker set upon after confronting a gang attacking a homeless man.The UK's biggest banks gathered stock market momentum amid revived hopes of a revamped 700 billion US dollar (392 billion) financial salvage plan.Stars and politicians gathered to pay tribute to some of the nation's unsung heroes in a ceremony to reward acts of courage.Chris Brandon is out of Citys plans until JANUARY after going under the knife for corrective ankle surgery.Jamie Langley is turning up the heat in his bid to win an England World Cup place.
