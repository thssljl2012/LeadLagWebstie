The biggest nationalisation of modern times will be announced today with a 50billion state rescue of Britain's crumbling High Street banks. The Government will take the drastic step amid fears that without the injection of taxpayers' money some of the most recognisable names in banking could vanish in days, if not hours. The historic intervention will signal a new era for the banks and raises the spectre of the giant firms falling under the control of politicians and civil servants.The Treasury is expected to buy stakes in the Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and Halifax Bank of Scotland. Though Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling are desperate not to present the move as a crisis measure, it was clear that another day of panic and chaos on the stock market had left them with no other option. The alternative was to allow the Royal Bank of Scotland - one of the world's ten largest banks with a 1,900billion balance sheet - to collapse, dragging down large sections of the economy with it. Yesterday the owner of NatWest saw 40 per cent of its market value wiped out, with shares trading at one stage for as little as a penny. Last year they topped 6. The bail-out came on another extraordinary day of economic upheaval when: Final details of the part-nationalisation were being hammered out overnight in Downing Street crisis talks between Mr Brown and Mr Darling, Bank of England governor Mervyn King and Financial Services Authority chairman Lord Turner.The Chancellor emerged to confirm that he intended to unveil a package aimed at putting the banks on a 'longer term sound footing'. 'I intend to make a statement before the markets open tomorrow morning and I will be making a further statement to the House of Commons later in the day,' he said. More...            The Treasury has torn up its previous policy of responding to the economic turmoil on a case-by-case basis - intervening to nationalise Northern Rock and the Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley - in favour of an overall rescue plan.However, there are doubts about whether it will be effective at such a late stage. The $700billion bail-out of toxic bank debts in the U.S. has so far failed to restore confidence. Last night Wall Street closed down another 508 points, or 5.11 per cent, marking the the Dow Jones index's biggest five-day point loss ever.  Critics will fear the bailout will give the state unprecedented control over the banking sector, but Whitehall and industry sources were at pains to insist that civil servants would not have a say over the day-to-day business of the banks, as happened when Northern Rock was nationalised. Yesterday City figures lined up to accuse Chancellor Darling of dithering over how to respond to the crisis and failing to provide appropriate reassurance at an earlier stage. The sector has been paralysed as banks refuse to do business with each other, worried that competitors could fold. A holding statement from Mr Darling on Monday simply pledging to do 'whatever it takes' deepened confusion about the Government's strategy.Investors were spooked by reports that the banks had gone cap in hand to the Treasury asking for a bail-out. In the turmoil, one trade in RBS went through for a penny a share, before rebounding to 90p. The banks denied they had asked the Government for money, but there is little doubt that they are in desperate need of cash. HBOS shed 42 per cent yesterday, while merger partner Lloyds TSB fell 13 per cent and Barclays slid 9.2 per cent. Treasury officials accused bank bosses of triggering the collapse by leaking details of private discussions about a 'recapitalisation' package.
