European governments are considering redrawing the regulatory landscape. And with the financial crisis challenging some of the fundamentals of Anglo-American-dominated capitalism, Frances competing vision of a Europe with greater economic coordination is gaining some momentum.Proposals that only a week ago might have looked outlandish are suddenly being taken more seriously. As the United s Senate moved toward a vote on a $700 billion rescue package for American banks, officials here began debating whether Europe needed a similar, though smaller, fund of its own, though European leaders had dismissed initial calls for their own bailout by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.In Brussels, the European Commission proposed rules Wednesday aimed at toughening lender supervision, and approved the nationalization of the British lender Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley in a record 24 hours, brushing aside fears that the rescue might distort competition.France, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, suggested going much further  strengthening cross-border cooperation among regulators, unifying rules on bank deposit guarantees, altering accounting standards to no longer require banks to write-off losses immediately and possibly suspending government aid rules.The ideas are expected to be discussed at a meeting planned for Saturday in Paris, to be led by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president. Late Wednesday, though, the timing was still up in the air, since Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain and Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, had not yet confirmed whether they would attend.While the major banks in Europe, including Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Socit Gnrale, appear to be weathering the financial storm fairly well, several others have been taken over through government-engineered consolidations or nationalizations. The stepped up pace of activity comes as yet another bank, the giant pan-European lender, UniCredit of Italy, came under pressure in the stock market.UniCredit declared Wednesday that it was well capitalized but was being damaged by stock speculators after its shares were temporarily suspended from trading in Milan.Talk of a European bailout fund of 300 billion euros ($420 billion) made waves late on Wednesday, after Christine Lagarde, Frances finance minister, acknowledged that some sort of fund would be discussed at the weekend meeting. We are in agreement within the E.U. that we need to support the financial sector, Ms. Lagarde, who did not put a price tag on any such fund, told the German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview to be published Thursday. Then the question arises: Do we need a European rescue fund to save banks? Mr. Sarkozys office and the finance ministry were quick to deny that the fund was a French idea, and the German finance ministry attacked the notion as unwarranted.One European official suggested that the plan had been floated by the Netherlands. Jan Peter Balkenende, the prime minister of the Netherlands, will meet with Mr. Sarkozy in Paris on Thursday. The fund might take the form of a reserve set aside for emergencies by each country, with each setting aside the same percentage of gross domestic product.Another idea, which is being offered by the French, is the creation of a European regulator of banks and insurers, a European policeman, as Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the French European affairs minister, called it Wednesday. That would most likely mean a significant tightening of coordination among national regulators.Officials are also looking at ways to standardize deposit insurance levels across Europe to avoid limits being ratcheted up haphazardly from one country to another in response to seeming panics. Ireland decided this week to provide unlimited protection for all deposits at six Irish banks.France would also like to see changes to European accounting rules, which stipulate that banks and insurers have to mark down their assets in line with short-term movements in the market. Changes to the mark to market rules are also being considered at the Securities and Exchange Commission.While France waits for those wide-ranging reforms to be discussed, both Paris and Berlin are expected to call for a systematic suspension of rules that limit government assistance to national banks. In the current climate, they seek greater latitude to rescue stricken institutions. Officials in Britain said they were generally behind such a proposal.Germany, meanwhile, is arguing that Brussels should ease up in its enforcement of strict rules against subsidies. Such a step would have immediate relevance for the German bank WestLB, as well as other German state-owned banks.WestLB won initial approval for a 5 billion euro risk shield financed by the German government, regional German governments and local savings banks, to avoid a fire sale of its mortgage-linked assets. But it still needs to complete a restructuring that will persuade Neelie Kroes, the European competition commissioner, that the bank  after bailouts stretching back a decade  is on sound footing.Ms. Kroes sought to pre-empt calls to abandon government aid limits by speeding through authorization of the Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley nationalization.At the same time, she made an indirect criticism of the Irish government, which, according to European officials, gave little notice before announcing its deposit guarantee for six Irish banks. Britain said it would increase its guarantee for depositors to 50,000 ($88,700), from 35,000. Ms. Kroes warned governments to consult before taking actions, and invoked the Great Depression. When Europe was confronted with a banking crisis in the 1930s, governments decided to go national, to retreat from the European markets and close their borders, she argued. I would like to plead to national governments today not to act unilaterally. But Mr. Trichet cautioned against precipitous actions. Because Europe is not a fully-fledged federation, he said, a pan-European solution was unlikely. Each country has to mobilize its own efforts, he told Bloomberg Television in remarks released Wednesday. But of course there is a European spirit and that is the spirit of the single market. Britain is trying to steer the debate toward a college of national regulators that would coordinate their decisions. Luigi Guiso, professor of economics and finance at the European University Institute, said that so far national governments had dealt reasonably effectively with the situation but that would be tested if there was a problem with a bank like UniCredit, which operates in 22 countries, including Italy and Germany and in Eastern Europe.In hopes of preventing the situation from worsening, the Italian securities market regulator, Consob, said Wednesday that it had banned short sales, or bets on declines of banking and insurance stocks, following similar measures by British, American, German and French authorities.  .
