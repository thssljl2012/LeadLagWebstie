The major UK banks have suffered a dire day in the markets after reports they were in discussion with the Government over a multi-billion pound public funding deal.HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland were worst hit, both seeing their share price drop to lows of 41%.In addition to HBOS and RBS' drops, shares in Lloyds TSB have fallen by 11% and Barclays by 9%.The Prime Minister, the Chancellor and Governor of the Bank of England are this evening meeting the chairman of the Financial Services Authority at Downing Street to discuss the financial crisis.Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and Mervyn King will meet with Lord Adair Turner of the FSA.Bank shares plummeted when reports surfaced that RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin and his rival bosses at Barclays and Lloyds TSB met the Chancellor last night.HBOS, Barclays and RBS all insist they have not requested any cash from the state.Barclays earlier issued a statement saying it is 'categorically not requesting any capital from the UK Government'. It emerged that banks have held initial talks with the Government last night.But Downing Street says the Treasury is not speculating on possible financial crisis policy options.The talks will focus on what form of equity the Government would receive in return for providing banks with any injection of taxpayer's money.UK banking shares were sharply lower due to renewed speculation that the Government may take stakes in the main lenders.Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said: 'There must be no question whatsoever of ministers just handing over taxpayers' money to banks or taking on their bad loans. 'Any injection of funds must be part of a comprehensive programme which fully protects taxpayers' interests. 'We're effectively talking about part-nationalisation, and there is no point in trying to conceal that.' The effort to bolster finances in the face of the global credit crunch would dilute existing shareholders.
