Shares in major British banks suffered sharp falls in early trade Tuesday amid reports they had met finance minister Alistair Darling to discuss a rescue package.The worst-hit was Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which plunged by nearly 40 per cent at one point to as low as 90 pence, although it improved to 111.60 pence, a drop of 24.65 per cent, in midday trade.Lloyds TSB slumped 9.94 per cent to 233.25 pence and Barclays fell 5.89 per cent at 295.50 pence.The falls came after the BBC reported that all three banks took part in talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Darling late Monday to discuss a possible capital injection.RBS confirmed that its chief executive, Fred Goodwin, was at the meeting but gave no details of what was discussed.A spokeswoman said that RBS was 'very strongly capitalised' and had a 'high level of liquidity' and 'very strong customer deposits'. Barclays denied it had asked for capital from the government.Barclays chief John Varley told a banking conference on Tuesday: 'Contrary to press rumours, Barclays has not requested capital from the government and has no reason to do so.' Lloyds TSB, which is in the process of taking over its rival HBOS, said it was looking at 'opportunities' to raise capital, although it declined to comment on on Monday's meeting. 'We're taking a number of actions to reach this target, like paying full year dividend in shares,' he said. The BBC reported that RBS, Barclays and Lloyds TSB asked Darling to prepare a plan that would lead to them being recapitalised, meaning the government would use taxpayers' money to buy part of the banks' shares that would give the government preferential voting rights.  2008 AFP
