London - Bank shares on the London stock market showed a slight recovery Wednesday as markets anticipated the eventual passage of the US rescue plan. The Financial Times Index was up by 1.5 per cent, or 60.5 points, at 4,962.9 in early trading. All major banks, including Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), saw their share price go up. HBOS, which registered a fall of 14 per cent Tuesday, was up by 4 per cent to 127.1 pence (2.26 dollars) Wednesday. Lloyds was up by 9.5 pence to 236 pence, while Barclays rose by 11 pence to 337.5 pence.
