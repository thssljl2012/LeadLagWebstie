Bank shares plunged for a second successive day as traders headed for the exit after it emerged that bank bosses have held funding talks with the government. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland tumbled as speculation over its funding position deepened during another day of market turmoil. The bank's stock slumped 40% at one point amid reports boss Sir Fred Goodwin and his rival bosses at Barclays and Lloyds TSB met with Chancellor Alistair Darling last night to discuss a possible capital injection for the sector. RELATED ITEMS            The FTSE 100 Index slid 1%, wiping out a shortlived rally that came after yesterday's 7.8% fall. RBS, which fell 20% yesterday, was the worst casualty with Lloyds TSB down 16%, and Barclays down nearly 10%. RELATED ITEMS            RBS declined to comment on its share price movement today or the reports of a plea for a Government capital boost. But the bank confirmed that Sir Fred was part of the team of banking bosses involved in last night's meeting with the Chancellor. The BBC reported RBS, Barclays, and Lloyds TSB needed around 15 billion of extra capital each. Barclays denied it had requested a government cash injection. A spokeswoman for Lloyds TSB refused to comment on whether any discussions were taking place with the Government. 'We never comment on any discussions that may or may not have taken place with the Government,' she said. The BBC reported that RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin, Barclays chief John Varley and Lloyds boss Eric Daniels were present at the meeting, along with Bank of England Governor Mervyn King and the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner. A spokeswoman for the Treasury declined to comment on last night's meeting. RBS raised 12 billion of extra capital earlier this year to help cope with multi-billion investment write downs linked to the credit crunch. Barclays also raised 4.5 billion from existing and new shareholders to help shore up its balance sheet. Lloyds TSB last month agreed to take over Halifax Bank of Scotland, which has suffered from its own funding problems. There has been speculation that Mr Darling is considering moves to shore up UK banks with taxpayers' cash, but he did not give any firm commitments when he addressed MPs yesterday. He said 'all practical options must remain open' for dealing with the crisis, but added that it would be 'irresponsible' to give a running commentary on plans. Yesterday the Footsie plunged nearly 8% as the banking crisis intensified across Europe. London's leading shares started today's trading with some solid gains, but these fell away amid the fresh banking sector woes. They deepened in Iceland today, where the Government has stepped in to save another of the country's major banks, Landsbanki. Last week ministers were involved in a rescue of rival Glitnir. Icelandic internet bank Icesave today stopped UK customers withdrawing or depositing money, according to a notice on its site. The notice from the bank, which is part of Landsbanki, did not offer any explanation for the move but it came as Iceland's government grappled with a major crisis in its troubled banking sector. The notice said: 'We are not currently processing any deposits or any withdrawal requests through our Icesave internet accounts. 'We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our customers. We hope to provide you with more information shortly.' It is not known how many UK consumers hold money with Icesave, but it is thought that around 150,000 people in this country have savings with an Icelandic institution, mainly Icesave and Kaupthing Edge, the UK retail arm of Iceland's biggest bank Kaupthing. The Icelandic government joined other European governments yesterday in pledging to guarantee 100% of savers' deposits. But it was later reported that the guarantee covered only domestic savings and did not extend to people in the UK. If an Icelandic bank failed, savers would still have the first 16,170 of their money protected under the Icelandic savers compensation scheme, with the sum topped up to 50,000 for individuals, or 100,000 for joint account customers, by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).
