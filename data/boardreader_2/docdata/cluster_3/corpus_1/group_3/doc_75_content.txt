th October 2008 Royal Bank of Scotland was the biggest victim on another day of turmoil for banks amid mounting speculation that the Government is set to spend billions on a taxpayer-funded rescue of the ailing sector. RBS was down 40% at one point - with big falls for HBOS, Barclays and Lloyds TSB - following crisis talks with Chancellor Alistair Darling on Monday night. But in an attempt to calm market nerves, RBS said: 'Contrary to press speculation, RBS did not make a request to Government for capital.' Meanwhile, Iceland nationalised its second-biggest bank Landsbanki - leaving UK savers in limbo as its Icesave online website was frozen. The wider FTSE 100 Index was 2% higher after Monday's 7.8% slump - the biggest since Black Monday in October 1987 - as commodities bounced back slightly from the fall and oil prices rose. But attention was firmly focused on banks, with RBS - also downgraded by investment ratings agency Standard &amp;amp; Poor's - later down 22% after its denial. The bank's stock slumped after Sir Fred Goodwin and his rival bosses at Barclays and Lloyds TSB met Chancellor Alistair Darling on Monday night - with a possible capital injection for the sector reportedly on the agenda. The concerns caused a fresh spike in money markets as fearful banks refused to lend to each other.
