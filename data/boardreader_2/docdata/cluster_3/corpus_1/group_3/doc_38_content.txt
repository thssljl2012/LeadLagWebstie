Concerns were growing yesterday over the effectiveness of the US government's $700bn (395bn) bank bailout scheme.The revised plan, which will see the government buy up so-called 'toxic' assets from banks with large operations in the country, was passed by the House of Representatives on Friday after being rejected earlier in the week.It is hoped that by taking these assets off companies' balance sheets, confidence will return to the banking sector, increasing liquidity in the credit markets as banks once again lend to each other.Sources close to Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch are warning that the scheme could trigger a new round of write-downs by the banks as they are forced to calculate the value of their toxic assets, while others have predicted that banks will snub the scheme and instead decide to hold on to the complex products.There are also concerns about the price that will be paid for the assets by the government. It is thought that if the Federal Reserve pitches this too high it will run into heavy criticism, while if the price is too low the scheme will fail to work.The bailout could also potentially have a negative impact on banks that are not even taking part in it, as plans to buy up the assets from other banks will effectively give them a market price, meaning other institutions may have to announce new write-downs.One Sunday newspaper warned that banks may be put off taking part by restrictions on executive pay and the banning of so-called golden parachutes, one of the strings attached to the deal.Some UK banks, such as Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, are likely to be able to take part in the bail-out.It has been estimated that UK banks hold around 95bn of assets that will qualify for the scheme.
