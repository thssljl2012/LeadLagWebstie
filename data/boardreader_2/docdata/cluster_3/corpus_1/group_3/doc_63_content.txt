The British government has announced plans to partially nationalise major banks, with taxpayers taking a share stake in a bid to restore stability.The Treasury made the announcement today before markets opened, saying eight banks have signed up for the so-called recapitalisation plan, which offers up to 50 billion pounds ($124 billion) in the form of preference shares.The Treasury said the eight banks are Abbey, Barclays, HBOS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Nationwide Building Society, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered.As part of the plan, the government will buy preference shares in the banks.The decision comes a day after Royal Bank of Scotland, the nation's No. 3 lender by market value, plunged 39% in London trading on concern that the company's financial condition was deteriorating.The steps to partially nationalise the banking industry provide ''the necessary building blocks to allow banks to return to their basic function of providing cash and investment for families and businesses,'' Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling said in a statement.The worsening credit crisis has forced the UK to join the US, Ireland, Iceland, Belgium and Spain in rushing out untested bail-out measures to save their largest banks. RBS and HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, surrendered more than half their market value this week as investors lost confidence in their ability to fund themselves.RBS, Barclays, Lloyds TSB Group and three other UK banks need to repay as much as 54 billion pounds of debt by the end of March 2009 as borrowing costs reach record highs and banks are reluctant to lend to each other. The total, which includes bonds, convertible bonds and commercial paper, is triple the debt repaid in the same period a year ago.RBS has about 11.5 billion pounds of obligations coming due in the next six months, while Barclays, the UK's second-biggest bank by market value, has 15.9 billion pounds maturing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Near collapseUK banks have been talking to government officials for weeks about selling stakes to the Treasury and lifting the guarantee on bank deposits. Ireland and Germany increased their deposit guarantees after the near-collapse of banks in those countries shook investors' confidence.While RBS denied ''speculation'' yesterday that it asked the government for help, the bank has been overstretched since it paid about 14 billion euros ($28 billion) last year for the investment banking and Asian units of ABN Amro.
