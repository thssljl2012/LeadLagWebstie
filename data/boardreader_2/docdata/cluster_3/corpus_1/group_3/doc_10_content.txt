TROUBLED lender HBoS has agreed to sell its Australian banking business for 1.2 billion as it struggles to overcome the crisis that has engulfed the company in the recent weeks. The bank has sold Bank of Western Australia and St Andrew's Australia Pty in the hope that it would 'further enhance the group's capital position and reduce the group's wholesale funding requirements.'The retail, business banking, insurance and wealth management businesses will be sold to Commonwealth Bank of Australia, whose chief executive is Ralph Norris, subject to approval.Colin Matthew, chief executive of HBoS International, said: 'The sale of BankWest and St Andrew's at this time is in the best interests of HBoS.'This transaction will further enhance the group's capital position and reduce the group's wholesale funding requirements.'HBoS handles more savings than any other UK bank, with deposits totalling 258bn for both consumers and businesses. For every 100 deposited in UK banks, HBoS currently takes 16.But it has recently run into a series of financial problems and the group's share of net mortgage lending, which takes into account people moving their home loan to a different provider, more than halved from 15 per cent in 2007 to just seven per cent today.It also revealed sharply lower profits and said it was concerned about rising bad debts as customers struggled with repayments.The interim results showed that pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June plummeted 72 per cent to 848m.At the same time it saw a 36 per cent leap in bad debt charges to 1.31bn, which it said could rise further.Lloyds TSB, which has tabled a 12.2bn bid to take over HBoS, has confirmed it is supporting the sale.The news comes as the Government prepares to pump 50bn of taxpayers' money into the banking sector to bolster their depleted balance sheets.Shadow chancellor George Osborne repeated his willingness to cooperate with the Government, but warned the injection of funds could not be a bail-out of failed bankers.News from across the Atlantic has made his warning all the more pressing when it was revealed that, less than a week after the US government had to bail out American International Group (AIG), the insurance company sent executives on a 250,000 retreat to a posh California resort.'Average Americans are suffering economically. They're losing their jobs, their homes and their health insurance,' said Democratic House Oversight Committee chairman Henry Waxman during a lengthy opening statement.'Yet less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation.'
