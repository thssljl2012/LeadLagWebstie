Previous of Companies Next Royal Bank Of Scotland Group HBOS Barclays The shares fell 58p, or 39pc, to 90p as investors bailed out of Britain's second-biggest bank. The tumble came despite RBS denying press reports that it has asked the Government for more capital. The chief executives of RBS, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and HBOS met the Chancellor, Alistair Darling, on Monday night and other senior members of the Tripartite Authorities. Sentiment in RBS was also hit by a cut in its credit rating late on Monday. Ratings agency Standard &amp;amp; Poor's yesterday warned that 'RBS's financial profile may continue to weaken' and a 'combination of mixed earnings prospects, deteriorating credit risk in its key geographies, and difficult market conditions.' RBS raised 12bn of extra capital earlier this year to help cope with multi-billion investment write downs linked to the credit crunch. Shares in the bank have fallen by 79pc in the past 12 months. Last year RBS bought Dutch bank ABN Amro in a joint acquisition with Banco Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium. The 70bn (55bn) deal is seem by some investors as overpriced and in August RBS announced pre-tax losses for the first-half of 2008 of 691m, caused in part by write-downs linked with the ABN Amro deal.
