Now is not a great time to be an ordinary shareholder in Britain's banks, as the government's 'nuclear option' of hoovering up large stakes in return for 50billion of rescue funding moves closer.Analysts believe that if the Treasury part-nationalises the banks, dividends to ordinary shareholders will be scrapped until the taxpayer has been repaid.The value of investors' holdings could also be heavily diluted.Mark Phin and James Hutson at brokerage Keefe, Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods said: 'It's likely that in the event of capital injections, dividends to equity shareholders would be passed until such time as taxpayers were repaid in full.'It is thought the government's recapitalisation plan means injecting as much as 30billion up-front in four of Britain's top banks - Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HBOS, and Lloyds TSB - with the rest to be drip-fed to the ailing lenders in the coming years.Lifeboat: Brown is planning a bank bailoutThis raises obvious concerns about the health of the public accounts.Nationalising Northern Rock and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley has already seen the government take 137billion in liabilities onto its balance sheet.If the move is deemed to be an effective nationalisation, all of the banks' liabilities could show up in the public sector balance sheet, pushing the national debt through the roof.A banking source said the four British banks involved all have different capital needs.RBS appears to be most in need of cash, despite tapping investors for 12billion in June in the biggest ever rights issue.The source said: 'RBS is really thinly capitalised and has the biggest short-term wholesale funding requirement of any UK bank.'Banks have stopped lendingto each other in wholesale-money markets on fears they won't get it back following a string of collapses.RBS has a core tier 1 capital ratio - a measure of how well- capitalised it is - of5.7 per cent. Lloyds's ratio is 6.2 per cent, Barclays' is 6.3 per cent, and HBOS is at 6.5 per cent.Barclays and RBS both denied asking the government for a capital infusion.But analyst Sandy Chen of Panmure Gordon said both firms could be heavily exposed to contracts written to insure against debt defaults.Events such as the implosion-of Lehman Brothers could trigger hefty payments hundreds of billions of dollars of payments across the financial world.In return for providing rescue funding, the Treasury is said to be mulling over three options that will protect its huge investment on behalf of the taxpayer.The first is to take preference shares, which rank ahead of ordinary shares in the event of a collapse, and pay out a much higher dividend.It is thought this annual 'coupon' to the Treasury's coffers could be 7 per cent to 8 per cent.Purchasing convertible preference shares is also being considered. This would give government the ability to convert its holding into ordinary shares at some future point, allowing the taxpayer to share in the longer-term upside.The final option is to buy warrants, which are certificates that could entitle the Treasury to buy a further slug of shares in the banks at a knock-down price.This model is closer to that adopted by legendary investor Warren Buffett, who recently invested 2.6billion in Goldman Sachs' preference shares and has taken warrants on a further 2.6billion in the investment bank's stock.Recapitalisations are not a new concept.Indeed, some politicians - Tory leader David Cameron and US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson - are big admirers of the so called 'Swedish model' of the early 1990s.The Scandinavian country suffered a financial emergency after a property bubble burst, sending its economy into reverse between 1991 and 1993.The authorities decided the banking sector needed to shrink, so they separated those that had the best chance of survival from those that didn't.The weaklings were either liquidated or merged into healthier banks.Those that were saved, were forced to give up a big chunk of their shares to the government.A 'bad bank', called Securum, was set up to take on all the poisonous loans and recoup taxpayers' money.In total, the Swedish authorities pumped about 5.3billion into the banking sector, or 4 per cent of GDP.A comparable amount injected into UK banks currently would be about 56billion.The plan was a success as it actually made a profit for Swedish citizens.British taxpayers will be hoping our own efforts yield a similar outcome.Share this article:
