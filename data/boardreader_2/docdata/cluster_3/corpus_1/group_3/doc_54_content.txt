'We have categorically not requested capital from the government,' Barclays spokesman Alistair Smith said, declining to comment on whether the bank had been involved in talks with the government on a potential recapitalisation. Barclays, along with Lloyds TSB's Eric Daniels, Sir Fred Goodwin of Royal Bank of Scotland and representatives of other major British banks, were reported to be discussing a Treasury plan for the government to take equity stakes in return for capital injections. Shares in the bank were trading down 13 - or 4pc - at 300p around midday after falling as low as 261p earlier as billions of pounds were knocked off British banks and investors remained nervous about the outlook for financial markets. Mr Darling has refused to speculate on what kind of support package he may offer UK banks. He told Parliament yesterday: 'Providing a running commentary could add to uncertainty. All practical options must remain open to us.'' Mr Varley, in a speech to a Merrill Lynch conference in London today, said: 'We have our feet on the ground. We understand very clearly that the environment is difficult, and that it's quite likely to get more difficult as economies in the world decelerate.'
