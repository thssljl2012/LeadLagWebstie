Gordon Brown has said he is confident that Lloyds TSB's planned takeover of struggling Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) will go ahead despite growing doubts in the market.HBOS's shares fell 12% on Tuesday and have lost more than half their value in the past two weeks - raising concerns over whether the deal will have to be repriced to gain the approval of Lloyds TSB shareholders.But in an interview with Sky News, Mr Brown said: 'This merger between HBOS and Lloyds TSB is a matter of great detail. I'm confident from talking to people involved that this merger is going ahead.'At the end of the day it is a matter for shareholders not a matter for Government and I believe that some of the issues that were raised at the beginning are being dealt with and I am pretty confident that both parties want to go ahead with this deal.'Asked if he was prepared to bail out HBOS if the deal collapses, the Prime Minister said: 'We have already dealt with this through helping the merger take place. We changed the competition law to make it possible.''The shareholders will eventually have to make a decision in a few days time about what is right for them, but I am confident by talking to the leading parties on this that not only do they want to go ahead with this but they are determined to do all the work that will make this possible.'Fears over Monday night's derailing of the 385 billion banking bail-out for US financial institutions also weighed on bank stocks.Lloyds has offered 0.833 of its own shares - currently equivalent to 187p - for every HBOS share in a deal valuing the lender at 9.8 billion.But HBOS shares were trading 33% below this at about 125p on Tuesday, raising questions over whether the takeover would be waved through as it currently stands.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
