The government is keeping a close eye on developments in the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS and is in close contact with the main players.'Of course the government is staying in touch with the relevant parties,' said a spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Wednesday.Brown, who would have seen HBOS shares slump 20% at one stage yesterday, has said he is confident the deal will go through despite speculation Lloyds will try and renegotiate terms.Currently, HBOS shareholders will receive 0.83 Lloyds shares for each HBOS share held. At today's prices, the deal values Halifax owner HBOS at 218p, but it's trading at just 167p on talk Lloyds may slash its original offer by a quarter.'Lloyds themselves are saying that they are pressing ahead with the takeover and the prime minister, as he said yesterday, is confident that the takeover will go ahead,' added the spokesman.It was only the government's decision to waive anti-trust restrictions that allowed the takeover to even be considered.But it still requires a majority of Lloyds TSB shareholders and 75% of HBOS shareholders to approve the deal.HBOS - HBOS
