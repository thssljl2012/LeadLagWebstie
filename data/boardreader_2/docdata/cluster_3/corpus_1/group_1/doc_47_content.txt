 SYDNEY, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group , Australia's third-largest lender, has launched an issue of around A$500 million ($427.4 million) of Tier 1 capital, it said on Wednesday. The ANZ offer consists of convertible preference shares (CPS) that will mandatorily convert into ordinary shares with a 2.5 percent discount in June 2014. Initial pricing suggests a margin between 250 and 290 basis points over the bank bill swap rate. The margin will be determined on Sept. 3 following an institutional bookbuild. 'The offer forms part of ANZ's continuing capital management strategy and provides cost-effective hybrid capital for the bank whilst giving investors an attractive offering from a AA rated financial institution,' said Rick Moscati, ANZ's group treasurer. Dividends on the CPS are preferred, fully franked, non-cumulative and based on a floating rate. The majority of the offer is expected to be snapped up by Australian retail investors, keen on high coupon securities. The securities will be rated A+ by S&amp;amp;P and Aa3 by Moody's. The issue is led by a large syndicate of joint leads including ANZ, Citi, CommSec, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs JBWere, JPMorgan, Macquarie and UBS. ABN AMRO Morgans and Credit Suisse are co-managers. ANZ is the fourth Australian bank to raise this type of capital with similar attributes this year. The offer is part of a relatively new type of Tier 1 capital, called non-innovative Tier 1, that offers a cheaper form of capital compared with ordinary equity. Banks are required to maintain Tier-1 as a cushion to protect bank deposits.
