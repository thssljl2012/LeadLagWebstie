 SYDNEY, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the country's No. 2 bank by assets, is considering buying a stake in non-bank lender Aussie Home Loans, the Australian Financial Review reported on Wednesday. CBA would take a 30 to 40 percent stake in a deal that would value the company at more than A$200 million ($174.4 million), the paper said without citing its source. Non-bank mortgage lenders have been hit hard by the global credit crunch, which has seen a sharp rise in their cost of funding, allowing the big banks to grab back market share. Unlike the banks, the non-bank lenders don't have the luxury of retail deposits to fund their operations and rely entirely on the debt markets to fund their operations. Mortgage lender RAMS, Australia's first high-profile victim of the subprime mortgage crisis, was forced last year to sell part of its business to Westpac Banking Corp after failing to refinance over A$6 billion of debt when credit markets suddenly dried up and cut off its main funding source.
