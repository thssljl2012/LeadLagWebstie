 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group is keeping an eye on its exposure to embattled investment bank Babcock &amp;amp; Brown Ltd, but has not made any specific provisions for potential losses, chief Mike Smith says. Australia's third-biggest lender is already on the back foot with its investors, having announced an additional allowance of about $1.2 billion for bad-debt charges last month. Additionally, ANZ has suffered blows to its reputation over its involvement with Opes Prime, with a report released last week revealing management failures in relation to its dealings with failed broker. There are now concerns Babcock could cause more headaches for ANZ. Babcock has lost 90 per cent of its value so far this year because of the global credit crisis, but it says it is not under financial pressure and remains within its banking covenants. 'It's hard to see how that one will unfold but at present you know I think the situation with the company with the various investments is still unravelling, we'll have to wait and see,' Mr Smith said. ANZ shares have fallen 43 per cent so far this year, closing on Friday at $15.59.
