  said  decision not to renew its partnership would reduce its $700 million book of business by 8% and have a partial impact on its 2009 profit. St George appointed AIG Life as its new life insurance partner on Monday.Tower said that assuming no other business changes, the loss of the partnership would have around a $60 million impact, or 8%, on Tower's $700 million in-force book and an annualised contribution margin impact of up to $4 million.'Tower Australia is disappointed to lose this business but it was not unexpected,' the company said.'St George has made the decision to go with a one partner model for its bank channel and group business and Tower Australia did not have the bank channel expertise.'The insurer said the impact would be lessened as it continued to grow its in-force book and due to related cost reductions in the 2008/2009 financial year.'There will be no profit impact in the 2008 year and a part impact in the 2009 year depending on when the transition takes place,' the company said.Tower also said it risked losing the business in time if a merged Westpac Banking Corporation and St George followed the trend of all other banks and eventually moved the insurance in-house.As at 1159 AEST, shares in Tower were down 16c, or more than 5%, at $2.70 while St George was up $1.48, or 5% at $28.92.
