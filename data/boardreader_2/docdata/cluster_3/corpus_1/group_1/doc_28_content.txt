 AMSTERDAM/ZURICH (Reuters) - European financial groups ING (ING.AS: Quote, Profile, Research) and Zurich Financial Services (ZURN.VX: Quote, Profile, Research) reported quarterly profits that met or exceeded expectations on Wednesday, helped by strong insurance businesses and limited investment writedowns.But smaller insurers in Europe, more vulnerable to credit market turmoil and weakening economic conditions, reported sluggish profits.ING's second-quarter net profit fell 25 percent to 1.92 billion euros ($2.86 billion), hurt by lower real estate, private equity valuations and investment returns. This was above the average forecast of 1.52 billion euros in a Reuters poll of 12 analysts, as well as the highest forecast of 1.69 billion euros.Zurich, which reported first-half figures, said it had net profit of $2.68 billion, in line with 12 analysts' average forecast of $2.62 billion.Shares fell broadly, reflecting continued concern over insurance portfolios after last week's massive $5 billion net loss from U.S. insurance giant American International Group inc (AIG.N: Quote, Profile, Research) and a halving of quarterly net profit at Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group Fortis (FOR.BR: Quote, Profile, Research).ING was down 0.5 percent at 22.86 euros at 0816 GMT, while Zurich fell 1.9 percent. The DJ Stoxx European Insurance index was down 3.84 percent.Zurich and ING's results have proven to be more resilient through the credit crunch and subprime crisis than many of their peers. Zurich, Europe's fourth largest insurance group, has managed to weather difficult financial markets as well as competitive insurance markets, where prices are dropping.ING has taken limited writedowns on subprime-related investments, triggered a year ago when large numbers of less creditworthy U.S. borrowers began to default on mortgages, but the Amsterdam-based group still has a comfortable cash cushion of potentially 3.9 billion euros to weather any further credit turmoil.
