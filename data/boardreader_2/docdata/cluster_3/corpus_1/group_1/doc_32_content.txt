 NEW YORK (Dow Jones) -- The largest mortgage insurers reported that mortgage defaults rose 1.4% in July after falling the two prior months. The Mortgage Insurance Companies of America said that in July its lenders reported 68,831 defaults. They peaked at 73,880 in April when one major lender changed its default-reporting practice to report loans as in default at 60 days past due instead of 90 days. Mortgage cures, or delinquencies that are brought up to date, fell 9.2% in July to 39,229 loans. Primary insurance in-force totaled $801.6 billion, a 7.9% increase from July 2007 as lenders adopt more conservative lending standards. The data reported by the trade group consists of loans covered by the largest mortgage insurers. Data are from American International Group Inc. (AIG), Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW), Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp. (MTG), PMI Group Inc. (PMI) and Old Republic International Corp. (ORI). -- Kathy Shwiff, Dow Jones Newswires
