 Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (BRKA, BRKB) second-quarter net income fell 7.6% as softness in the insurance industry continued to hurt results.Earlier this year, Warren Buffett told investors that 'the party is over,' saying he expects insurance earnings to fall off significantly in 2008. The second-quarter results of rivals such as American Insurance Group Inc. (AIG) bear out the weakness in the business of underwriting insurance policies. Though Berkshire owns businesses ranging from See's Candy to Benjamin Moore paint, its various insurance companies still generate the bulk of its results.Buffett's conglomerate posted net income of $2.88 billion, or $1,859 per Class A share, compared with $3.12 billion, or $2,018 a share, a year earlier.Operating earnings, which exclude investment and derivative gains and losses, were $1,465 a share, down from $1,625. The mean earnings estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was $1,370 a share.Derivative gains and losses must be reported because of accounting rules, and most observers expect Berkshire to profit from the derivatives unless stock markets crumble over the next two decades. However, Berkshire has said the derivatives could lead earnings to swing widely until they mature in 15 to 20 years.Revenue rose 10% to $30.09 billion, while investment gains fell 60% to $242 million.Insurance underwriting earnings dropped 43% to $360 million. Insurance investment earnings rose 2.5% to $884 million. Earnings at the company's noninsurance businesses rose 3.5% to $1.09 billion.Earnings excluding taxes and minority interests at the company's Geico car insurance unit fell 8.3%. Premiums earned rose 5%.Reinsurance unit General Re's profits fell 56% as premiums fell 5.7%.In January, Berkshire launched a municipal-bond insurer, Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp., to take advantage of disarray in that market.Outside of the insurance industry, Buffett has been known to buy iconic American brands. In its latest big deal, Berkshire will contribute about $6.5 billion to Mars Inc.'s $23 billion buyout of gum and candy giant Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. (WWY). The European Commission cleared that transaction last week.Berkshire has been busy with other deals as well. It will also become Dow Chemical Co.'s (DOW) largest shareholder with the purchase of $3 billion of convertible preferred securities. Dow will use the proceeds to help finance its purchase of Rohm &amp;amp; Haas Co. (ROH). Berkshire also stands to profit handsomely with the sale of Anheuser-Busch Cos. (BUD) to InBev (INB.BT).In after-hours trading, Berkshire class A shares were at $115,418, down 0.3%.-By Jay Miller, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2331; jay.miller@dowjones.comClick here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=NId47M3vsqdNbn%2FahaPRAg%3D%3D.
