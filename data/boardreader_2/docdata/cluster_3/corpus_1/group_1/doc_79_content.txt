 Tricom Equities may need to lean on erstwhile saviours, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Babcock &amp;amp; Brown, to secure its future, after Danish lender Saxo Bank ended its plans to buy a 35 per cent in the ailing brokerage. Tricom said in a statement on Monday, it was 'actively working' with ANZ and other stakeholders to 'ensure the business remains appropriately capitalised.' The paper also said while Saxo's acquisition plans have been laid to rest, a future joint venture could still be on the cards. An spokeswoman for ANZ said: 'ANZ is continuing to work with Tricom. 'Following discussions over the weekend, we remain confident we can find a suitable structure between the various stakeholders for Tricom to be appropriately capitalised and to continue to operate effectively.' The Sydney brokerages troubles began in January when it failed to settle trades on time after heavy sharemarket volatility triggered margin calls on some of its clients. Since then it has seen the collapse of a prospective deal with peer Bell Financial Group which pulled out of the deal in March, citing its due diligence had revealed an 'unquantifiable risk'. Babcock &amp;amp; Brown, ANZ and a group of private investors had since recapitalised Tricom with a $30 million cash injection, before Saxo Bank emerged as a white knight for the broker in May.
