 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Australia's third-largest lender, has launched a $500 million issue of convertible preference shares. The securities will convert into ordinary shares in 2014 and will pay a margin between 250 and 290 basis points over the bank bill swap rate. 'The offer forms part of ANZ's continuing capital management strategy and provides cost-effective hybrid capital for the bank whilst giving investors an attractive offering from a AA rated financial institution,' ANZ Group treasurer Rick Moscati said.
