 EIGHT executives have left ANZ and the bank's practices have been panned over its involvement in the stock lending Opes Prime disaster.A review committee, headed by veteran company director David Crawford, found the bank's board of directors did not know of the  exposure to stock lending through Opes Prime and Primebroker until October 2007 - six years after the business had started.Chief executive Mike Smith said the board's ignorance of the problems with stock lending was a case of management incompetence, not a cover-up.'It's not a very convenient excuse,' he said.'But it is an incompetence, you're right, it's not a conspiracy.'Those forced to leave the bank in the purge include two senior executives - chief risk officer David Stephen and institutional managing director Peter Hodgson.Two unnamed employees in the bank's stock lending business have also left after breaching the bank's code of conduct.As part of the review's wide-ranging recommendations the bank is closing the stock lending business, which advanced money to buy stock in return for legal title to shares.It is also reviewing credit policies. Mr Smith and Mr Crawford revealed the findings of the review committee at a press conference yesterday. No members of the ANZ board were present.At its peak in August last year, the bank had $2 billion exposed to stock lenders including Opes Prime and Primebroker, both of which have collapsed.But the board was told only $200 million was at risk because an unnamed senior risk officer decided to rate the exposure at 10 per cent of face value.'It was clearly a mistake,' Mr Smith said.'It should have been 100 per cent - and is now.'The bottom line is that we were in a business we should never have entered into in the first place.'We then compounded the problem by not having the usual risk assessments. Management action was too slow and follow-up was poor.'To sum it up I would say it was a failure to connect the dots,' he said.The review found the stock- lending business was not properly controlled or understood by the bank and slammed executives for 'a lack of individual accountability'.It found the stock-lending business had grown without proper oversight, with 'limited understanding of the existence or significant scale of the equity finance business ... before March 2005'.No product approval was sought for stock lending when the bank started to offer it in 2001, existing lending policies were deficient, and whistleblowers had been ignored.A risk review undertaken in 2005, which identified problems, was not acted upon quickly, resulting in  exposure to some brokers more than doubling.The review report found that the two workers sacked from the stock-lending business ran margin lending accounts with Opes Prime that were in the red.The bank has taken internal disciplinary action against an undisclosed number of other employees.ANZ shares closed 8c higher at $15.67.
