 SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) Chief Executive Mike Smith Wednesday said that the average cost of funding for banks continues to rise as less expensive funding matures and despite a recent stabilizing of new funding costs.Smith also said that changes in cash rates by central banks are no longer a reasonable guide to commercial banks' funding costs. 'The reason this is so significant at present is that customer deposits only account for around 50% of bank funding,' he said, according to the text of a speech he gave in Auckland, New Zealand. 'The gap between the cash rate and money market rates is much wider than the historical average and is not showing any sign of easing. The new reality is that movements in cash rates set by central banks are no longer a reasonable guide to the cost of bank funding,' he said. As less-expensive funding matures and is replaced by new funding, 'the average cost of funds - the money that banks have borrowed on domestic and international markets to lend their customers - is increasing,' he said. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian government are pressuring commercial banks to pass on in full to customers any cut in the cash rate by the central bank. -By Iain McDonald, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2953; iain.mcdonald@ dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=WwUGXuM5wyJmFTKP%2BNcDNQ%3D%3D.
