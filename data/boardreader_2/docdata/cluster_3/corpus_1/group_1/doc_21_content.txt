 Shares of American International Group Inc. last week hit their lowest level since 1995 after Credit Suisse Group said mortgage write-downs may cause a $2.41 billion third-quarter loss. In addition to being the nation's largest insurer, AIG is a much-watched stock because it is a component of both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index. Credit Suisse analyst Thomas Gallagher cut his estimate for AIG to a loss of 86 cents a share from a profit of 13 cents, citing possible losses on credit-default swaps, which are financial devices that act as insurance for debt default. The AIG unit that sold the swaps may post a $6.5 billion loss in the third quarter, compared with a previous estimate of $2.6 billion, Gallagher said. AIG's swaps guaranteed $441 billion of assets as of June 30, including $57.8 billion in securities tied to subprime mortgages. Gallagher rates New York-based AIG 'neutral' and cut the company's target price to $22 from $30. AIG Chief Executive Officer Robert Willumstad hasn't ruled out seeking more capital after the company raised $20.3 billion in May by selling debt and equity. He told investors earlier this month that the company is 'obviously dependent on the condition of the U.S. housing market.' Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp;amp; Poor's have said AIG's credit ratings may be cut if results don't improve. The firms cut AIG's ratings in May after the company posted a record $7.81 billion first-quarter loss.
