 SYDNEY, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  is monitoring its exposure to struggling investment firm Babcock &amp;amp; Brown Ltd  but has not made any specific allowance for possible losses, the bank's boss said.Australia's third-biggest lender is already on the back foot with its investors, having announced about $1 billion in bad-debt charges last month and admitting on Friday to management failures over the recent collapse of a local brokerage it funded.There are now concerns Babcock could cause more headaches for ANZ. Babcock has lost 90 percent of its value so far this year because of the global credit crisis, but it says it is not under financial pressure and remains within its banking covenants.ANZ Chief Executive Mike Smith, in an interview aired on ABC television on Sunday, declined to detail the bank's exposure to Babcock but said ANZ had not made any specific provision for potential loan losses from that exposure. 'It's hard to see how that one will unfold but at present you know I think the situation with the company with the various investments is still unravelling, we'll have to wait and see,' Smith said. ANZ shares have fallen 43 percent so far this year, closing on Friday at A$15.59. (Reporting by Mark Bendeich; Editing by Louise Heavens)
