 TROUBLED lender Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley today said investors had bought more than one in four of the new shares offered under its 400 million fundraising plans.B&amp;amp;B said 27.8 per cent of its new shares had been taken up by investors when the deadline for the rights issue expired on Friday.Although better supported than a recent rights issue by rival Halifax Bank of Scotland, almost 300m of B&amp;amp;B's new shares will be left with underwriters backing the cash call.The result of the rights issue came as B&amp;amp;B unveiled former Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester boss Richard Pym as its new chief executive with immediate effect.Former chief executive Steven Crawshaw stepped down in June due to ill-health, leaving the company in the hands of chairman Rod Kent.B&amp;amp;B - like several of its larger rivals - has been forced to raise cash to shore up finances hit by the credit crisis.The company has around 850,000 smaller investors from the former building society's demutualisation in 2000, holding around a third of the shares.They are unlikely to have taken part in the fundraising, because in recent weeks the stock has been trading below the 'discounted' 55p price of the new shares.But the move has been backed by some of the group's largest shareholders including M&amp;amp;G Investment Managers, Legal &amp;amp; General Investment Management, Insight Investment and Standard Life Investments.The support comes despite a rights issue process dogged by problems which have dented the reputations of B&amp;amp;B's management.In April, B&amp;amp;B first denied that it needed extra capital - before unveiling a 300m rights issue in May at a 'discount' price of 82p.But shares fell below this level and following a profit warning, the lender later announced alternative plans to offer cheaper shares - as well as selling a 23 per cent stake in the company to private equity firm Texas Pacific.Texas walked away from its 179m investment in July, forcing B&amp;amp;B to revamp its plans for the second time.The lender instead pressed on with another enlarged rights issue to raise the 400m, supported by its biggest institutional investors, and underwritten by investment banks Citi and UBS.Six high street banks - HBOS, Abbey, Barclays, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC - are also sub-underwriting the fundraising move, which will leave them with stakes in the lender.B&amp;amp;B is due to post its results for the first half of a difficult year for the banking sector on August 29.It added today that there had been 'no material change' in trading since its last update in June, when it revealed an 8m pre-tax loss in the four months to the end of April.The group was hit by sharply climbing arrears and a further 89 million in credit crunch losses.
