 The ANZ Bank has signalled the likelihood of a settlement in legal battles with investors following the collapse of Opes Prime.The collapse resulted in 1,200 of the stockbroker's clients losing their money when the ANZ called in $650 million in loans at the height of the credit crisis.A review found the bank failed to adequately identify the risks of dealing with Opes Prime.Chief executive Mike Smith says legal proceedings are continuing, but the bank is now in mediation with investors. 'It is a question of do you want 20 years of protracted litigation and reputation issues, or do you want something more pragmatic,' he said. 'It is a balance.'
