  CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - A Goldman Sachs analyst says the potential for a capital raise and ratings downgrades at American International Group Inc. is increasingly likely.Analyst Thomas Cholnoky said in a research note late Monday investors should 'stay on the sidelines with AIG,' as the New York-based insurer is likely to see more losses.'After another surprisingly negative quarter, it appears that investor confidence in AIG is damaged,' Cholnoky wrote. 'We believe the stock may continue to drift down as investors remain wary of the possibility of a dilutive capital raise, the potential for ratings downgrades, and the corresponding effects on the underlying business.'This articleEmail this page     Tell us your thoughtsHelpful linksCanadian Business OnlineBecome a member now  My Canadian Business'Specifically, we foresee $9 billion to $20 billion in economic losses from the (credit default swap) book, which could result in larger cash outlays, resulting in a significant shift in the risk quality of AIG's assets, forcing rating agencies downgrades, and resulting in large-scale capital raises,' the analyst wrote. Credit default swaps are essentially a type of insurance on complex financial contracts.AIG shares fell $1.21, or 5.6 percent, to $20.39 in morning trading Tuesday. The stock is down 63 percent in the year to date.Like other insurers, AIG has been hit hard by deterioration in the credit markets amid concerns that complex, structured investments it insures will increasingly default.Earlier this month, AIG reported a worse-than-forecast $5.36 billion quarterly loss on more mortgage-related write downs.It was the insurer's third consecutive multibillion-dollar quarterly loss, underscoring the continuing problems for the New York-based company and others that hold securities tied to the withering housing market.Cholnoky maintained a 'Neutral' rating on the stock and cut his price target to $23 from $30.
