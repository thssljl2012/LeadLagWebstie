 Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has appointed the deputy chairman at Northern Rock, the troubled nationalised lender, as one of three new non-executive directors in a move aimed at pacifying investors.Stephen Hester, who is also chief executive at British Land, the commercial property group, will step down from Northern Rock on October 1, when he will join RBS's 10-strong board of non-executive directors.The bank has also appointed John McFarlane, the former chief executive at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, as a new non-executive as well as Arthur Ryan, previously chairman at America's Prudential Financial.Investors have been pushing Sir Fred Goodwin, RBS's chief executive, and chairman, Sir Tom McKillop, to strengthen the bank's board after it recently reported a 692 million first half loss, before which it raised 12 billion through a rights issue.Shareholders in RBS are also understood to be angry about a lack of succession planning on who will replace Sir Fred or Sir Tom when they eventually step down.Existing non-executives, Lawrence Fish and Charles Koch, will leave the RBS board.
