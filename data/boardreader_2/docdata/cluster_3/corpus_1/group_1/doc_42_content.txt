 SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) Chief Executive Mike Smith said Friday the bank remains on track for a cash profit of around A$3 billion for the year ending Sept. 30, 2008.Speaking to journalists after the group announced the results of a review into its business after the collapse of client Opes Prime, Smith said that the group's underlying businesses continue to perform well.Last month, Melbourne-based ANZ warned that its cash profit - a smoothed measure closely watched by investors - will fall 20%-25% from the previous year's A$3.92 billion result due to rising provisions for bad and doubtful debts. -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2957; lyndal.mcfarland@ dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=msysc34sJNryHXUKmt4ODQ%3D%3D.
