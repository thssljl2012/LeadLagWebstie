 The Royal Bank of Scotland announced on Wednesday it appointed a trio of non-executive directors in effort to address weaknesses on its board.The bank said that Stephen Hester, chief executive of British Land and former chief operating officer of Abbey National; John McFarlane, who retired last year from his career in banking which included the last 10 years running Australia and New Zealand Banking Group; and Arthur Ryan, who retired in May this year as chairman of Prudential Financial, will all join the board Oct. 1. The banks chairman Tom McKillop had been pushing for the bank to hire noin-executive directors with more banking experience across different regions.According to The Telegraph, the pending hires had renewed speculation in the City last night that banks chief executive, Fred Goodwin, may be preparing to step down.Mr. Goodwin, 49, and Mr. McKillop, 65, have been criticized for agreeing to pay too much for Dutch lender ABN Amro before the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market and global credit crunch. RBS and partners Banco Santander SA of Spain and Fortis of Belgium outbid Barclays last year for ABN Amro, paying a total of $110 billion in the biggest banking acquisition in history.The bank raised 12.3 billion pounds in June to shore up capital, depleted by write-downs and the ABN Amro purchase.
