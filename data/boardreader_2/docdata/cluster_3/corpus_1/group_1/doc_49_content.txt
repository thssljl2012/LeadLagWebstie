 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd has taken action against staff and developed a remediation plan to the address management, control and accountability issues identified in a new report on the banks involvement in securities lending and its relationship with broker clients, including the collapsed Opes Prime group.CEO Mike Smith said There have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events. The collapse of brokers has had a significant affect on the lives of their clients and their families together with those of the affected staff members at ANZ. Mr Smith said the comprehensive 13-point remediation plan would provide ANZ with a step change in the management of risk, particularly in institutional banking, and will draw a line in the sand at ANZ about performance and accountability in the future. The review committee found weaknesses in the management and oversight of the equity finance business within ANZs securities lending unit, Mr Smith said. Taken together, this meant that ANZ did not adequately identify and manage the range of risks which arose from the operation of a business of this nature. In reviewing this issue, its clear the findings have some wider implications for ANZs management of other non-traditional businesses, particularly in our institutional division. The committee identified breaches of ANZs code of conduct by two employees, who will leave ANZ.The bank also identified a range of other management accountability issues associated with the operation, management and oversight of the equity finance business, and has taken action involving a number of employees, including formal notes placed on employment records, cuts to remuneration, and the departure from ANZ of six managers and executives.A number of executives who had already left the institutional division would also have been subject to employment sanctions had they remained at ANZ. Mr Smith said ANZs shareholders, customers and the wider community have a right to expect the bank to conduct its business with the highest standards of business practice. We have dealt clearly and squarely with the accountability issues and have a comprehensive remediation in place to address the shortcomings in management and control we have identified particularly within risk management and the institutional division.
