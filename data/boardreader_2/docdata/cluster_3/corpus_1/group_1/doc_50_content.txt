 SYDNEY, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Australia's St George Bank Ltd , target of an A$18.1 billion ($16 billion) takeover offer, said on Tuesday it was on track to meet earnings forecasts, but noted that funding conditions remained difficult.The bank, Australia's fifth biggest lender by assets, said it would meet its targeted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8-10 percent in 2008 thanks to strong growth in all its business areas and cost controls.St George, which is recommending what would be Australia's biggest ever bank takeover from Westpac Banking Corp , also said it had completed 2008 wholesale funding. 'Against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment St.George continues to perform well with strong growth across its core businesses and product lines, sound asset quality and effective cost control,' Chief Executive Paul Fegan said in a statement.The bank saw turmoil in global credit markets affecting funding, with the situation possibly worsening in the short term.It said unaudited cash profit, or core profit from which dividends are paid, was A$1.073 billion for the 10 months to 31 July 2008, 12.5 percent ahead of the 10 month period to July 2007.St. George said it had no exposure to U.S. or domestic sub-prime lending, CDOs or hedge funds.The bank said it had also raised A$3.3 billion of its estimated A$11-$12 billion term wholesale funding requirements for 2009.Australia's major banks have come under scrutiny after National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB)  and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ)  last month issued profit warnings due to provisions for bad loans, shaking confidence in their ability to weather the credit crunch.Last week Westpac assured investors it would avoid the major loan losses the other two had flagged.Westpac has offered 1.31 of its shares for every St George share, and St George Bank shareholders are set to vote on the deal early in November.(Reporting by Mette Fraende) . ngInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
