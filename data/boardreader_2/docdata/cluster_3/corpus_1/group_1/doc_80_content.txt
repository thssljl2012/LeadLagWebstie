 Tricom Equitiess plans of survival have been dealt a blow with Danish investment bank Saxo set to abandon its plans to buy a 35 per cent stake in the troubled broker. According to the Weekend Australian, Saxo and Tricom were engaged in crisis talks last night to secure a last minute solution. If unsuccessful Saxo will officially end the deal on Monday. Saxos departure could leave Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and ailing investment firm Babcock &amp;amp; Brown exposed to tens of millions dollars in equity and debt, the paper said. Saxo founder Lars Christensen had said in June that things were still on track, halfway through a three-month due diligence period. According to the paper, Saxos change of heart may be related to Tricoms relationship with Babcock &amp;amp; Brown, which has $35 million of shareholders' money tied up with the broker. Babcock, currently undergoing a dramatic restructure, has seen its share price fall from a high of $34.78 a year ago to a close yesterday of $2.48. 'We can't make any comment on this yet. We'll be putting something out soon though.' Tricom is being investigated by the ASX and is expected to be fined over a delay in settlement of shares,  a Saxo spokesperson said. Tricom troubles began in January when it failed to settle trades on time after heavy sharemarket volatility triggered margin calls on some of its clients. Since then it has seen the collapse of a prospective deal with peer Bell Financial Group which pulled out of the deal in March, citing its due diligence had revealed an 'unquantifiable risk'. Babcock &amp;amp; Brown, ANZ and a group of private investors had since recapitalised Tricom with a $30 million cash injection, before Saxo Bank emerged as a white knight for the broker in May. A Tricom spokesman told the paper that there were some 'structural issues' with the deal but could not confirm if it was off.
