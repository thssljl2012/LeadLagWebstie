  Mark Kleinman and Louise ArmitsteadRoyal Bank of Scotland (RBS) will today announce the appointment of a trio of non-executive directors in an effort to demonstrate that Britain's second-largest bank by market value is addressing shareholder concerns in the wake of its 12bn rights issue. The Daily Telegraph has learned that RBS is to unveil Stephen Hester, the chief executive of British Land, Arthur Ryan, the former chairman of Prudential Financial of the US, and John McFarlane, a former banker with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), as non-executives. Banking sources said the appointments were expected to be announced this morning, although a last-minute hitch could delay it.RBS is also expected to say that Lawrence Fish and Charles Koch will stand down as part-time directors at the company's annual meeting next April.Last night, speculation mounted in the City that Sir Fred Goodwin, RBS's chief executive, was also preparing to stand down. Asked if that was the case, an RBS spokeswoman declined to deny it.Earlier this month Sir Fred apologised when he announced that RBS's first-half profits were wiped out by 5.9bn of writedowns on assets linked to sub-prime US mortgages.The bank announced losses of 691m in the first six months of the year - a sharp fall from the 5.11bn pre-tax profit it made in the same period last year. Sir Fred said: 'I won't do this job for ever, but right now you will find me extremely galvanised to do the task at hand.' The appointment of the three non-executives, which comes after a recruitment process lasting several months, is designed to appease investors after a turbulent period for the bank, during which it has been forced to go cap in hand to investors for the biggest rights issue in British history. Along with other banks both in Britain and abroad, RBS was forced to admit that additional banking experience among its non-executives was desirable.RBS, under the leadership of Sir Fred and Sir Tom McKillop, the chairman, has been criticised by shareholders for, among other things, pursuing the 71bn (56bn) takeover of ABN Amro, the Dutch banking group, as part of a three-way European consortium, even after the onset of the credit crisis had begun to raise doubts over the health of the international banking industry.It is unclear how the appointment of the non-executive trio will be received by shareholders. Mr Hester has extensive banking experience from his previous roles as finance director and chief operating officer of Abbey National, although he has endured a difficult year as boss of British Land, which has itself seen its share price hit by the broader downturn in sentiment towards the property industry.In addition to his tenure at ANZ, Mr McFarlane also worked at Standard Chartered, while Mr Ryan is a veteran of Chase Manhattan, the US banking group, as well as his time at Prudential Financial.RBS is not the only British bank to have been hit hard by the credit crunch. Barclays has raised capital from a group of sovereign investors from Asia and the Middle East while HBOS raised 4bn through a poorly-received rights issue. Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley are among the others to have suffered in the wake of Northern Rock's nationalisation.Last night, RBS declined to comment on the appointment of the non-executives.
