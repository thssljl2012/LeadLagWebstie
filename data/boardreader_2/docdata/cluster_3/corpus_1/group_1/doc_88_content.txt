 JOHN Symond, who made a career out of opposing major banks, is about to sell a slice of his $200 million-plus Aussie Home Loans empire to the nation's biggest bank.Mr Symond is believed to be weeks away from signing a deal with the Commonwealth Bank to sell a 30 per cent stake of his company, which could see the multi-millionaire pocket more than $60 million, The Australian reports.'I would like to reiterate that we continue to look at the best way to grow the Aussie business,' Symond said in an email to Aussie staff yesterday.'There are many options available to us in today's market, as we are in a far stronger position than most of our competitors, and we want to take advantage of this.'He emphasised that Aussie would remain focused on growth 'whilst fiercely protecting our independence'. If the deal succeeds, Aussie will become the second major non-bank lender to fall into the hands of a major bank, potentially weakening the competitive landscape.RAMS Home Loan sold its franchise distribution business last year to Westpac Bank for about $140 million after the non-bank lender hit trouble in the wake of the global liquidity crisis.US giant GE is urgently looking for a buyer for its third of Australia's major non-bank lenders, Wizard Home Loan.Aussie was founded by Symond in 1992 as a banking alternative to the big banks -- National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and ANZ Bank -- offering cheaper interest rates and better customer service.It was promoted as the bank for the Aussie battler.A source yesterday insisted that, under the CBA deal, Aussie Home Loans would retain its independence. They said the deal was about giving Aussie more 'financial grunt'.
