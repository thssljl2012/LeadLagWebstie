 Two senior ANZ Bank employees have left the company as a result of its internal review into its stock lending business which found weakeness in the management and oversight of the division following the collapse of its client Opes Prime.The bank announced the resignation of chief risk officer David Stephen and institutional group managing director Peter Hodgson and said that a number of executives who have already left the institutional division ''would also have been subject to employment sanctions had they remained at ANZ.'' Six lower level employees involved in the issue have left the company within the last two days, as well.ANZ shares fell as much as 27 cents, or 1.7%, or $15.32 in early trade.The review was prompted after the collapse of Opes Prime Group, a stockbroker which specialised in margin lending, in March due to global credit crisis. ANZ, which had lent $616 million to the broker, seized shares held as security from Opes and sold them to recoup the loan.The report, which did not examine the causes behind the Opes Prime collapse, spurred the bank to issue a 13-point remediation plan to shore up the division's management, control and accountability issues.The remediation actions look reasonably thorough, said Austock banking analyst John Buonaccorsi. 'You can probably see the guiding hand of APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) there, saying 'don't think that you have fixed the problem if you quit equity finance (stock lending), there is a deeper structural issue here.'''Mr Stephen will be replaced by Chris Page, former head of risk for the Asia Pacific Region, while Mr Hodgson's role will be temporarily filled by Alex Thursby, group managing director for Asia Pacific.''The Review Committee found weaknesses in the management and oversight of the Equity Finance business within ANZ's Securities Lending unit,'' said ANZ chief executive Mike Smith in a statement. ''Taken together, this meant that ANZ did not adequately identify and manage the range of risks which arose from the operation of a business of this nature.''The report found no proof of fraud by employees, although ''the accounts of two ANZ employees had been permitted to remain out of order and, accordingly, the subject of a margin call, for a significant period.''''These employees breached the ANZ code of conduct,'' the report said.Share trading by two employees before Opes Prime went into receivership didn't breach company policy, according to the review, nor were the trades conducted for ''illegitimate or unlawful purposes.''The review addressed the failure of issues to be brought to the attention up the line of command, as well.Under a section of the report titled ''Failure to identify warning signs,'' the review said various concerns were raised by line and risk managers with their peers and supervisions in the Institutional division.''These concerns related to the processes, personnel and systems used in the Equity Finance and Standard Securities Lending businesses and the risks associated with these businesses.''''The issues that were identified were not consistent with good banking practice and should have prompted further investigation and scrutiny.''
