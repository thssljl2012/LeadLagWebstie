Investors Hope AIG Bailout Will Soothe MarketsGovernment Bails Out AIG With $85 Billion LoanA  A   A(September 17, 2008)--The White House Wednesday wasnt using President Bush's standard line about the economy: that its 'fundamentals are strong.'Spokeswoman Dana Perino said the current situation is 'not clear-cut' because of the many positive and negative economic indicators that sometimes come on the same day.While refusing to repeat the 'fundamentals are strong' line, she did say the country is 'in a position of strength to be able to deal with' the current crisis, but she concedes, 'it will take us a while.'Perino defended the federal takeover of insurance giant AIG, saying the move was aimed at protecting the economy and people from further harm. She said the administration would consider help for other threatened companies on a 'case-by-case basis.'Among those who have been pleading for Washington's help is the struggling auto industry, which has suffered massive losses but remains a backbone of the economy.A bill before Congress would give the companies $25 billion in federal loans.Despite the AIG takeover, there was no reduction in anxieties about Wall Street's problems.The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 300 points at midday.On Monday, the Dow lost 504 points, the largest tumble since its drop following the September 2001 terrorist attacks.On Tuesday, it rose 141 points, after the Fed decided to leave interest rates unchanged.[CentralTexasVotes.com: Candidates, Campaigns And More ][More Local And State News][More National News][More Business News][Latest Religion News][Latest Health News][Latest Entertainment News][OffBeat News][News From Our Town][Latest Soldier Stories]
