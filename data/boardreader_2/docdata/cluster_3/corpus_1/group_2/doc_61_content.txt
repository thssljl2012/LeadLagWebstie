Federal regulators may be spending too much time worrying about the financial problems facing Wall Street while neglecting steps they might be taking to help Main Street, according to the head of a Senate panel charged with overseeing banking and housing legislation.Senator Chris Dodd, D-Conn., the chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said he is open to further federal action to shore up financial markets, provided that Federal Reserve officials discuss their reasoning for any bailouts with him ahead of taking action.Some proposals Dodd said he would consider include allowing the Federal Reserve to provide banks with interest and potentially floating a bridge loan to troubled insurance giant American International Group (AIG).'I'm willing to listen. I'm skeptical, to tell you quite candidly, but I'm willing to listen,' Dodd said at a press conference in the Capitol. 'But I want to have them come to me as they're thinking about it not announcing it and expecting us to go along with it as they have in the past.'In a conference call held after the government takeover of mortgage giant Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) earlier this month, Dodd was audibly upset with administration officials for leaving key lawmakers, including himself, out of the decision-making process.To facilitate keeping lawmakers in the loop, Dodd said he asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to keep the Senate in pro-forma session through the end of the year to allow Dodd and other committee chairmen to call their committees back into session to address potential future actions.Dodd added that he wants to see the Federal Reserve take more actions to help homeowners struggling with mortgages in addition to the moves it's making to calm financial markets reeling from the effects of foreclosures on bad loans.'If the Federal Reserve Bank is going to be using bad debt as collateral to extend loans or resources to financial institutions, how about doing the same for homeowners? Allow them to have new mortgages to save their homes,' Dodd said. 'If it's good enough for Wall Street, it ought to be good enough for people, the 9,000 per day, who are running the risk of losing their homes.' 1 2 Next Page
