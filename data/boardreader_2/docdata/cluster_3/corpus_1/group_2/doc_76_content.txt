ABC News' Matthew Jaffe reports: Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joe Biden Wednesday backed off his unequivocal statement a day earlier against a federal bailout of embattled insurance giant AIG. 'I don't think they should be bailed out by the federal government,' Biden said Tuesday to Meredith Vieira on NBC's 'Today' show. 'I'll tell you what we should do. We should try to correct the problems that caused this. And what's caused this? The profligate tax cuts to the very, very wealthy that John wants to continue. What's caused this is the failure to have regulation.' But Wednesday, at a campaign stop in Mansfield, 0hio, after the Fed's $85 billion AIG bailout, Biden sounded a less emphatic tune. 'The truth is, I don't know what the bailout is yet,' he said. 'And it looks like they're lending 'em a little bit of money. I don't know what they've done. I haven't had a brief on it.' Biden added that he planned to speak soon to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson.Lets be really clear. The only disagreement on this issue is between John McCain and John McCain,' said Biden spokesman David Wade. 'One day, hes Gordon Gecko, and the next day, hes Teddy Roosevelt. Joe Biden made it clear that nobody likes bailouts, and we should never have been put in this deep hole as a country. Taxpayers shouldnt have to be asked to clean up another mess. But here we are. 'Sen. Obama and Sen. Biden agree that whatever happens, the Fed needs to make sure it protects the families that count on insurance, bolsters our ability to create good-paying jobs, and helps working Americans pay their bills and save their money. The answer isnt to bail out the shareholders or management of AIG. Its John McCains economic philosophy he once boasted about that got us deep into this mess, and that choice between philosophies is on the ballot this November.
