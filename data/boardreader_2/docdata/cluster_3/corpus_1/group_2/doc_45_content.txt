ALBANY - New York officials helped giant insurer American International Group Inc. strike a loan deal with the Federal Reserve on Tuesday night to keep AIG afloat and avoid another fiscal crisis for the state.Gov. David Paterson called it 'great news' that will preserve jobs and, because of it, 'our financial recovery will be easier.'Paterson singled out his superintendent of insurance, Eric Dinallo, for helping preserve the opportunity for AIG to come to a deal with the nation's central bank. The state's offer on Monday to help AIG reach into its subsidiaries to borrow $20 billion bought time for the larger deal.The $20 billion borrowing didn't turn out to be necessary once the federal agreement was struck.AIG's uncertain future was just part of New York state's fiscal nightmare this week, after Wall Street was hit by losses unmatched since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 'We probably lost a billion dollars' on Monday, Paterson said.The Democratic governor said Tuesday on CNBC that the stock market losses are sad for America, but especially damaging for New York state. That's because state government has come to depend on getting 20 percent of its revenues from Wall Street.Paterson said the losses on Wall Street on Monday alone may have wiped out the $475 million in spending cuts approved this summer in a special session of the Legislature to avoid a state budget deficit this year.He reiterated that he may call the Legislature back into session to make further cuts before Election Day.'I know they are campaigning and they want their constituents to hear from them, but the situation is that dire,' he said. Three of the troubled Wall Street firms - Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns - had nearly 30,000 employees in the state and paid roughly 10 percent of Wall Street wages and 15 percent of all Wall Street bonuses, state officials said.Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli reassured state workers invested in the state pension fund that the companies made up only a small portion of the fund's investments.The downfall of Lehman, which declared bankruptcy Monday, meant about a $400 million hit to the pension fund - just two-tenths of 1 percent of the $154 billion fund, DiNapoli's aides said.Includes reporting by Albany Bureau writer Joseph Spector.
