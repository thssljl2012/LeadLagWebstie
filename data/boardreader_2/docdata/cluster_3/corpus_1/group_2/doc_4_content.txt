 finance workers were last night warned they may lose their jobs as Britain's biggest mortgage lender faced a day of reckoning following a dramatic rescue bid by a rival.HBOS - the bank behind the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands - spent yesterday in advanced talks with Lloyds TSB ahead of an expected takeover announcement today.But reports last night indicated that HBOS staff had been told to expect up to 40,000 redundancies as a result of the proposed merger.That would be a cut of around a third of the 140,000 combined staff of the two banks.Lloyds TSB was last night on the brink of sealing a dramatic rescue of the ailing mortgage giant over a merger that would create a 30bn banking organisation with nearly a third of the UK mortgage market.The HBOS share price plunged by as much as 70pc this week amid funding worries.The government threw its weight behind the proposed tie-up, with reports that the prime minister had been personally involved. There were also rumours that the government was prepared to waive the usual competition rules in a bid to see the deal go through, such are Number 10's fears about the effects of a failure by HBOS.Talks between Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank and prime minister Gordon Brown had taken place, and the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority have also been involved.The developments came on another day of turbulence on global stock markets, with the fallout from the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers far from over.The day started with news from across the Atlantic that the US government had bailed out insurance giant AIG, which had been facing collapse.A takeover of HBOS would end uncertainty about the health of the bank, but there were immediate fears about the implications for the 135,000 UK staff employed by both firms - 65,000 by HBOS and the remainder at Lloyds TSB.Alex Salmond, the first minister of Scotland, where around 17,000 HBOS jobs are based, attacked the spivs and speculators he blamed for targeting the Scottish-based bank. He said any merger between the two should be based on measured discussion, not a shotgun marriage driven by speculation.The potential merger is the latest dramatic episode this week which has already seen the collapse of 158-year-old investment bank Lehman Brothers and the $85bn (47.2bn) bail-out of US insurance giant AIG.Central banks around the world have pumped tens of billions of pounds into money markets to try to ease nerves.
