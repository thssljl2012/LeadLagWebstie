World stock markets tumbled for a second consecutive day yesterday, with investors unnerved by the risk of a full-blown global financial crisis despite huge cash injections from central banks. Wall Street continued the rout that began in Asia and spread to European exchanges a day after US investment giant Lehman Brothers stunned the market with a bankruptcy filing. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.54 percent in early trade, largely on fears that insurance giant American International Group (AIG) might be the next credit crunch victim. AIG shares plummeted as much as 70 percent. But Wall Street managed to advance later on growing speculation that the US government would come to AIG's rescue because the risk of letting it fail would be too great. 'This has the appearance of a cascade or a contagion,' said David Kotok, the chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. 'Stemming contagion is the job of the central bank  and it must apply its lender of last resort function.' The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan injected $210 billion (R1.71 trillion) into the money markets yesterday to boost liquidity.
