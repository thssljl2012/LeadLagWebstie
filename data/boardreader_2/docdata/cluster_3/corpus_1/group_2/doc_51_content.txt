(RTTNews) - Republican leaders in the House of Representatives are calling on the Bush administration to better explain the philosophy behind recent federal interventions in the financial markets. A key Democratic lawmaker has also scheduled hearings on the topic, but the growing confusion within the president's own party highlights how unexpected it is that an administration explicitly dedicated to the principle of market-driven economics would come to oversee the largest collection of government interventions in decades.A bipartisan group of leaders from the House and Senate were briefed Tuesday night about the Federal Reserve's decision to extend an $85 billion bridge loan to troubled insurance giant AIG, but some leading Republicans are still having trouble seeing the overall plan.Representatives Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Adam Putnam, R-Fla., said they had a hard time seeing a coherent strategy behind the AIG decision when venerable investment bank Lehman Brothers was left to go bankrupt just a couple days before. The Fed and other authorities had refused to back Lehman's riskiest investments, leaving the company unable to find a buyer.'Members of Congress could have gotten a little more of a heads up as to how AIG was intertwined with so many things out there in the marketplace right now,' Blunt said. 'Our caucus doesn't feel like they understand the coherent strategy if there is one.'Blunt said that many Republicans, himself included, had thought that the message sent by refusing to help Lehman was that the government was not going to back every faltering institution and that bad business decisions have to be shouldered by the companies that make them. Blunt added that he felt that had been an important message to send. 'That's further complicated now by 24 hours later or 48 hours later coming in with an AIG decision that seems to contradict that,' he said. Putnam added that he recognized that the Fed and Treasury are 'plowing new ground' but said better communication with Congress is essential.'I think it's important that Treasury and the Fed dispatch an envoy to the Hill to bring members up to speed on the nature of events that are unfolding in front of us,' he said. 'Our communication lines are not operating efficiently.'Putnam said he recognized it was important to keep in mind the rapidity of decision making and the need for secrecy when even rumors of federal intervention can move the markets. But he argued that the administration needs to help members of Congress understand the reasoning so they can spread the message to their constituents.Saying that there have been 'ample opportunities' to explain to members of Congress the reasoning behind the individual decisions, Putnam said,'people need to understand the guiding principles behind this ad-hoc strategy.'The recent interventions in the financial markets, which began in March with the Fed-brokered sale of troubled investment bank Bear Stearns and continued earlier this month with the government takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have left some Republicans scratching their heads about where their party's market-driven philosophy has gone.
