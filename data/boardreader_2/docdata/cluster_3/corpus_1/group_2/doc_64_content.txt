THE US Federal Reserve has nearly finalised a deal to rescue teetering insurance giant American International Group (AIG) from collapse.The central banker will reportedly extend a $US85 billion ($105.8 billion) loan in exchange for nearly 80 per cent in AIG, US media reported. All of AIG's assets would be pledged to secure the loan, according to the New York Times and CNBC business network, citing people briefed on the negotiations. News of the talks came after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke went to Capitol Hill late last night in the US to meet with top leaders of Congress, The Times reported. Shares in AIG - a company with $US1 trillion in assets, and tentacles in many markets - went on a roller-coaster ride overnight, sliding 70 per cent at the open, swinging into positive and then closing down 21 per cent after a 60-per cent plunge on Monday.
