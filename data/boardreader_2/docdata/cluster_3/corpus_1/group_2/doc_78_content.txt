Money eases fears about potential collapse of company Published Date: 17 September 2008 THE US Federal Reserve has announced that it will provide a 47.2 billion emergency loan to rescue AIG, the biggest insurance company in the United States. Today's news will help ease fears about the potential collapse of the company, which would have had a massive knock-on impact in the UK and around the world. The bank said that the US Treasury Department had fully supported the decision to lend AIG the money. British banking giant Barclays has also today announced that it is to buy Lehman Brothers' North American investment banking and capital markets businesses for 138.9 million.The company filed for bankruptcy earlier this week after it was unable to find fresh capital to shore up its balance sheet  causing alarm in financial markets across the globe.Edinburgh-based Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBoS), which has seen its share price take a pounding after events in the US caused panic selling in the UK, has moved to reassure investors that it 'has a strong capital base and continues to fund very satisfactorily'.The Fed admitted that a 'disorderly failure' of AIG could undermine already fragile financial markets. It added that AIG's failure could also 'lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance'.White House spokesman Tony Fratto said: 'The president supports the agreement announced by the Federal Reserve. 'These steps are taken in the interest of promoting stability in financial markets and limiting damage to the broader economy.'As well as its deal to buy Lehman Brothers' investment banking and capital markets businesses, Barclays will also purchase its New York headquarters and two data centres in New Jersey for 830m.Barclays said today that it will acquire trading assets with an estimated value of 40bn and trading liabilities of around 38bn.John Varley, Barclays' chief executive, said: 'The proposed acquisition of Lehman Brothers North American investment banking and capital market operations accelerates the execution of our strategy of diversification by geography and business in pursuit of profitable growth on behalf of our shareholders, in particular increasing the percentage of Barclays earnings sourced in North America.' In the wake of Lehman filing for bankruptcy, HBoS shares plummeted by 18 per cent on Monday and a further 22 per cent yesterday.But in a statement to the market aimed at easing concerns about its financial health, HBoS said: 'HBOS notes the current volatility in bank share prices following developments in the United States. 'HBOS has a strong capital base and continues to fund very satisfactorily.'
