 Apparently that decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers wasn't a line in the sand after all. Government officials seemed to send a message to Wall Street by refusing to save the floundering Lehman Brothers firm. But on Tuesday the Federal Reserve provided its biggest bailout yet, lending up to $85 billion to American International Group Inc. (AIG), one of the world's biggest insurers. Talk about mixed messages.Even for a public anesthetized to billion dollar numbers, the nugget tossed to AIG is huge. Consider that the annual budgets for all six New England states combined amount to about $47 billion.The continued entanglement of the public and private sector is cause for concern. The U.S. government now effectively has an 80 percent equity stake in AIG.Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson dictated that CEO Robert Willumstud step aside and handpicked his successor, Edward Liddy, who formerly headed Allstate. That is not the role of government.The government has seized and bailed out all these massive corporations, putting tax dollars on the line, without any congressional action. Congress stands mute, happy to have someone else try to solve the crisis before members face election in six weeks.AIG, which got into trouble selling insurance on subprime mortgage securities, was apparently another outfit the government felt was too big to allow it to fail. The bailout was described as a temporary loan that can be recovered as pieces of AIG are sold off. But that sell-off process could have taken place within the private sector. We suspect other investors would have worked with AIG to get through the situation if the U.S. government had not lost its resolve and rushed to the rescue. Regional
