TALLAHASSEE -- Hours after Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink assured Gov. Charlie Crist and fellow Cabinet members on Tuesday that the state treasury can weather the Wall Street crisis, the Federal Reserve reversed course and pledged an $85 billion, late-night bailout and takeover of insurance giant AIG.Today, Sink is expected to take Wall Street to task when she jumps into the presidential election fray. Sink and other state financial managers said the $24 billion treasury, basically the state's checking account, may lose tens of millions of dollars from the bankruptcy filing of investment banking giant Lehman Brothers. But she and other top money managers spent the day assuring the Cabinet and reporters that state investments, including the $125 billion pension fund, are so conservatively invested that they are safe.Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty declined to speculate what the looming bankruptcy of AIG would mean for Florida policy holders while corporate and government officials in were in intense negotiations.The bailout was announced at about 10:30 p.m.This morning, Sink goes on the attack, scheduling an 11 a.m. conference call with reporters to discuss the Wall Street crisis and defend the policies of fellow Democrat Barack Obama, the presidential nominee who campaigns in Florida later this week.
