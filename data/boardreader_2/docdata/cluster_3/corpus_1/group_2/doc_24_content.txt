It also showed a new boldness by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, a former economics professor with a calm demeanor, to move swiftly and dramatically to deal with a crisis that he had been accused of soft-pedaling last spring.While government intervention in the economy is nothing new in America, taking such a huge stake in a large, international company has few precedents.The central bank, along with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, came to the conclusion that AIG was too big to fail, chiefly because the firm had insured billions of dollars of the poor housing debt held by many financial institutions.The decision to take control of New York-based AIG is a huge departure from conservative principles of the Bush administration and many Republicans in Washington. There has been a growing political aversion to such bailouts in both parties, beginning with the rescue and sale of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, earlier this year.But Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor, cited one possible reason for going this far. He said credit had been much tighter since March, and that many banks had obtained insurance from AIG against some of their bad housing loans.A bankruptcy by the insurance firm would curtail credit even more sharply, he said, 'and the noose around the economy's neck would continue to tighten. It would be very damaging to the real economy.' Government intervention in the economy is nothing new in America, but taking such a huge stake in a large, international company appears to be without precedent.The financial crisis is a big test of leadership for Bernanke and Paulson, a former Wall Street executive, who helped engineer the bailouts of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, government-sponsored mortgage giants, and federal assistance to now-defunct Bear Stearns earlier in the year.
