Kentucky U.S. Sen. Jim Bunning, a Southgate Republican, is challenging the federal government's authority to bail out private companies on the brink of financial collapse.Bunning has filed legislation that would strip the Federal Reserve of the authority to use taxpayer dollars to help unregulated companies such as insurer American Insurance Group (AIG), the latest company bailed out by the federal government.The government has agreed to rescue AIG with an $85 billion loan from the New York Federal Reserve to stave off a bankruptcy.'Once again the Fed has put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars to bail out an institution that put greed ahead of responsibility and used their good name to take risky bets that did not pay off,' Bunning said in a statement issued this afternoon.'The only difference between what the Fed did and what Hugo Chavez is doing in Venezuela is Chavez doesnt put taxpayer dollars at risk when he takes over companies, he just takes them.'Bunning's bill prohibits the Federal Reserve 'from making funds available at a discount rate to private individuals, partnerships and and corporations.'Federal officials who support the bailout say if AIG was allowed to fail it would send turmoil through the financial markets.But Bunning said the government is taking on too much financial responsibility and overstepping its authority with the bailout of AIG, mortgage companies and other companies. He said Treasury Secretary Harry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman 'did the right thing' by refusing to bail out Lehman Brothers, a Wall Street investment bank that filed the largest bankruptcy in history this week, listing debts of more than $600 billion.Yet less than two days after drawing that line in the sand, Chairman Bernanke, with the full blessing of Secretary Paulson, announced the takeover of AIG,' Bunning said. 'To say I am outraged by this would be an understatement. The greed on Wall Street is only exceeded by the stupidity of the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Federal Reserve.'I have said on more than one occasion that I dont think the Federal Reserve can handle the powers they have and this irresponsible bailout just proves my point,' he said.'As a result I have decided to do the Fed a favor and relieve them of some of their power by introducing a bill to take away their authority to make loans to non-banks, a power that prior to the bailout of (investment bank) Bear Stearns had not been used since the Great Depression.
