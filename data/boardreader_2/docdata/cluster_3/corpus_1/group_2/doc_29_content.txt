Investors are hoping to build on yesterday's recovery, after the government's unprecedented bailout of insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and the sale of Lehman Brothers to Barclays.The Federal Reserve last night announced it is stepping in with an $85 billion emergency loan to bail out AIG.In return, the Fed will take control of nearly 80 percent of AIG's assets and has the right to remove the firm's top executives.The Fed says AIG will sell some of its assets to repay the two-year loan.AIG had been teetering on the brink of failure because of stress caused by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the ensuing credit crunch. The Fed said a disorderly failure of AIG could hike borrowing costs, reduce household wealth, and materially weaken the economy.Governor David Paterson hailed the move, assuring New Yorkers the deal will help avoid further fiscal crises.'This is good news for New York and great news for policy holders and employees around the world,' said the governor. 'Through a reorganization and further action, jobs will be saved, businesses will be made stable, and certainly, our financial recovery will be made easier, if not sooner.'Paterson says the state will continue to play a supervisory role in the disbursement of AIG's businesses and in protecting local policy holders.Meanwhile, thousands of Lehman Brothers workers are breathing a sigh of relief  after Barclay's agreed to buy some of the bankrupt bank's best assets.Barclay's will pay about $250 million for Lehman's North American banking operations, which include Lehman's fixed income and equities sales, trading and research, and investment banking businesses.The move is expected to save about 10,000 jobs.The company will also purchase Lehman's Midtown headquarters and two data centers in New Jersey for about $1.5 billion.Other Stories09/17/2008 08:38 AM Updated 09/16/2008 11:21 PM Paterson Announces Feds' $85 Bil Loan To Insurer09/15/2008 05:41 PM Fortune Business Report 09/15/08Updated 09/14/2008 03:50 PM Talks Continue Over Fate Of Lehman BrothersUpdated 09/13/2008 03:21 PM Lehman Brothers May Be Sold In Pieces09/12/2008 05:05 PM Fortune Business Report 09/12/0809/11/2008 05:17 PM Fortune Business Report 09/11/08Updated 09/12/2008 01:59 PM Report: Feds Not Planning On Bailing Out Lehman Brothers09/11/2008 05:49 PM Fortune Business Report 09/10/08
