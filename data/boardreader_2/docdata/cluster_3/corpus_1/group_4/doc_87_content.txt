British bank Barclays moved to head off a shareholder revolt on Tuesday by offering them a slice of a 5.8 billion pound ($8.7 billion) capital injection from Middle East investors and scrapping 2008 executive bonuses.  Shareholders will be offered 500 million pounds of reserve capital instruments (RCIs) previously earmarked for investors in Qatar and Abu Dhabi under its controversial capital plan.   Many investors had said the RCIs offered too generous terms to the Middle East investors.
