LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Shareholders in British bank Barclays should vote against the lender's planned 5 billion pound ($7.40 billion) fundraising from investors in the Middle East, corporate governance advisers PIRC said on Monday. The capital raising would significantly dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and represents no improvement over the alternative of taking part in the government's rescue package for the banking sector, PIRC said in a statement. 'At least a part of the company's investor base should send a clear, unequivocal message that they do not think this was a good solution to the bank's current situation, and that it has come at a heavy price for existing shareholders,' PIRC managing director Alan MacDougall said. Barclays shareholders are due to vote on the capital raising on Nov. 24.
