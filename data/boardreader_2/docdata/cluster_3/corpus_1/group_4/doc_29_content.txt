THE billionaire Abu Dhabi sheik who bought Manchester City FC two months ago was yesterday set to pump up to 5billion into Barclays.  The bank unveiled Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, a member of the emirates royal family, as a major investor in plans to raise up to 7.3billion to strengthen its finances.  Two other existing Middle East investors  the Qatari Investment Authority and Challenger, which represents Qatars royal family  are also putting up more funds.   The trio could own nearly one-third of the bank between them following the capital-raising exercise, with Sheik Mansours stake in Barclays a potential 16.3%.  The Middle East cash helps Barclays to shore up its finances without using public funds meaning it will be able to pay dividends to its shareholders, unlike the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS.  The bank said the cash would boost its core tier-one ratio  a key measure of capital strength  to 7.6% from 6.3% in July. It follows a 4.5billion fundraising exercise earlier this year.  The move still has to be approved by shareholders.  In a trading update, Barclays added that third-quarter pre-tax profits were slightly ahead of the previous year, although it revealed a further 1.2billion of credit-market writedowns.  Its shares fell 13% to 178.9p amid City concerns about the cost of the financing terms struck with the Middle Eastern investors.  The sheik has firmly committed 3.5billion in funding to the bank, but also has the option to buy a further 1.5billion worth of shares.
