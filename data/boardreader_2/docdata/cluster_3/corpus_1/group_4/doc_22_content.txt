Lord Mandelson was today set to give the formal go-ahead for the merger between Lloyds TSB But the Government has passed legislation to override these concerns to take into account the economy's financial stability and the public interest. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform was remaining tight-lipped about the announcement before the markets closed today. Downing Street confirmed the report was due to be published. The Prime Minister's official spokesman added the order allowing the Government to permit the merger had been laid in Parliament on 7 October and came into force on the 24th. The OFT handed a report on the takeover's impact on competition last Friday to Lord Mandelson, who must decide whether to refer the merger to the Competition Commission. The deal would create a bank controlling about one quarter of British current accounts and 28% of home loans. If Lord Mandelson decides competition fears outweigh concerns over financial stability, he could refer the takeover. But he is expected to conclude the public interest is greater. Lloyds TSB has said it expects to complete its takeover of HBOS and capital raising by January, after giving shareholders a vote on both in the third week of next month. Lloyds TSB cut its offer price after the bailout and is now offering 0.605 of its shares per HBOS share, down from 0.833. The Government is injecting 17bn into the two banks and ministers have made clear the public funds are dependent on the merger going ahead.
