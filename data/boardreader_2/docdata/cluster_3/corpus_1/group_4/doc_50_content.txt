As a result Barclays expects to fully satisfy its commitment, made October 13, to raise external capital as part of its overall plan to achieve the higher capital targets set by the Financial Services Authority for all UK banks.  A release from the bank says: "The capital raising will enable to achieve its tier one and equity capital issuance commitments to the FSA with certainty and ahead of the previously announced timetable.  " It will also strengthen links with existing large shareholders, introduce a substantial new investor and provide the opportunity for existing institutional shareholders to participate in the capital raising."
