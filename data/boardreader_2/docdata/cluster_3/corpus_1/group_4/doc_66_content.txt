LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Lloyds TSB (LLOY.L: Quote, Profile, Research), which is in the process of taking over HBOS (HBOS.L: Quote, Profile, Research), plans to sell a 2-part government-backed benchmark bond, an official at one of the banks managing the deal said on Monday.  Guidance on both the sterling and euro bonds, with three-year maturities and both benchmark in size, has been set at mid-swaps plus around 20 basis points, the official said.  That is in line with pricing on a recent deal from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L: Quote, Profile, Research).  Lloyds will be the fourth British bank to make use of the new government guarantee to help support the financial sector, following bond sales by Barclays (BARC.L: Quote, Profile, Research), HBOS and RBS.  HSBC, Lloyds, RBS and Santander are joint leads on the euro deal, while HSBC, Lloyds and RBS are joint leads on the sterling tranche, the official said, adding that pricing is expected later on Monday.
