Gordon Brown is due to urge Gulf states to do more to stabilise oil prices as he kicks off a visit to the region.The Prime Minister will stress that the countries must maintain production levels to avoid 'spikes' in prices like those which contributed to the recent global financial turmoil.He will also insist they have a duty to use some of their massive oil wealth to help ease the impact of the credit crunch on the world economy.Mr Brown's four-day tour comes amid fears that the International Monetary Fund's 155bn reserves may not be enough for future bail-outs of struggling states.The fund has already allocated about 18.6bn in emergency loans to Iceland, Hungary and Ukraine, and Pakistan has signalled it may request aid in the next fortnight.While Europe and the US face recession, OPEC members are estimated to have more than 311bn in foreign exchange reserves stashed away.The growing importance of Middle East capital was emphasised on Friday when it emerged that Barclays raised 7.3bn from investors in the region to shore up its position.Mr Brown will be joined for parts of his visit by Business Secretary Lord Mandelson, Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband and a delegation of senior executives from UK firms.Downing Street said the PM would be emphasising the importance of 'transparency and stability' in the oil price, and calling for 'dialogue' between oil consumers and producers.He will also urge Gulf states to invest in renewable energy sources 'over the longer term', according to a spokesman.Editor's choiceA new vicar has taken over at St Peters Church in Rawdon .The Government has given Lloyds TSB's planned merger with HBOS the green light after overruling competition concerns raised by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).Welsh male voice choir Only Men Aloud has launched a bid to beat the X Factor winner to this year's Christmas number one.James Anderson has been left out of England's $20million showdown with the Stanford Superstars on Saturday to accommodate Graeme Swann as a second spinner.Guiseley avenged their recent FA Trophy defeat by winning 4-1 at Ossett Albion.
