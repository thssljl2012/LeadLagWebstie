BARCLAYS shares tumbled yesterday as investors gave the thumbs down to the banks plans to raise 7.3billion without turning to the Governments banking bailout. The bank is braced for bruising encounters with institutional investors after it agreed to raise at least 5.8billion from investors in Qatar and Abu Dhabi without giving them the chance to buy in on the same terms.  Instead, institutions were able to buy only 1.5billion of stock in an issue that closed yesterday. They only bought 1.25billion, as the banks shares plunged 25bp to 179p.   The fundraising is also significantly more expensive than the rescue package.   By spurning the Govern-ments money, Barclays will not suffer restraints on executive pay, dividend payouts and strategy.  But its freedom has come at a cost, with its fundraising likely to cost at least 30million a year more than taking state cash. Shareholders were also worried that in doing the deal as it stands, the bank had a nasty surprise in store. There were none in the trading update accom-panying details of the fundraising, with profits slightly ahead of last year.  A City insider said a lot of investors were grumpy. One, Co-operative Insur-ance Serv-ices, sold down its 3 per cent holding. Fund manager Jon Walters said the new capital could dilute the share price by up to 50 per cent.
