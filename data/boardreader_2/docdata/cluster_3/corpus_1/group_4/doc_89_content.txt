This week voting commences on the proposed merger of Lloyds TSB In addition  Royal Bank of Scotland is gearing up to follow Northern Rock down the path to nationalisation.   This is Money looks at what's going to happen. RBS This Thursday November 20, marks the Royal Bank of Scotland's annual meeting. What unique about this year is that shareholders will gather to cast their vote on the institution's 20bn capital raising plan.   The group is offering 18 new ordinary shares for every 13 existing shares at 65.5p. The cut-off for postal votes is at 3pm on Tuesday (November 18).   Right now, however, shares are cheaper on the open market, by mid-morning trading on Monday, shares in the group stood at 49.3p  representing a nosedive of 86% over the past 12 months. Lloyds TSB Lloyds has circa half a million private shareholders and is set to have its general meeting in Glasgow this Wednesday, November 19. The group will be asking its investors to cast their votes on the proposed merger with  (HBOS). If the proposed deal gets the thumbs up, it would see the merged banks re-branded as Lloyds Banking Group. In order for this happen more than half of voting shareholders must be in favour of the deal. Under this new identity, the banking colossus would control some 30% of the UK's current accounts as well as 28% of the mortgage marketplace.   The general sentiment is that brokers are in favour of the merger going ahead. Shareholders who don't cast a vote should remember that it is typical that a 'no-vote' will be viewed as a vote in favour.   Lloyds is seeking to drum-up 5.5bn of new funds as part of the deal. The majority of which, at 4.5bn, will be sought out through issuance of new ordinary shares and the remaining billion pounds via preference shares  Shareholders can buy the new ordinary shares at 173.3p. But with shares presently at around 148.9p  it seems that it will be likely that the government, which is underwriting it, will be mopping up the lion's share  if none are acquired the Treasury will be a 43.5% shareholder of Lloyds Banking Group. HBOS HBOS shareholders, of which there are about 2m private or retail stockholders, are being offered 0.605 Lloyds shares for every HBOS share they own.   The average HBOS small shareholding is 333 shares. If the Lloyds deal is approved someone with 333 HBOS shares will end up with 201 Lloyds shares.   The group will hold its own general meeting on December 12, it is expected that postal votes will have to be in prior to then. HBOS is offering shareholders 8.5bn of new shares, and again anything left over will be owned by the government. But again, the offer price of 113.6p is well above the current value of 77p, so better value is to be found on the open market. And Barclays? Having shunned the government's offer Barclays What about dividends?   Given that the once dividend  Banks such as Lloyds TSB are well known for the generous income their shares can provide, with yields of up to 20%. But as the matter stands now, banks which have sought help from the state cannot pay out a penny in dividends  The latest market data and broker views on each bank   BUY, SELL, HOLD   There are currently 9 broker(s) tracking this stock.
