A second Labour Party TD has been suspended from the Dil following a row with the Ceann Comhairle.  Tommy Broughan was asked to leave the chamber this morning after he attempted to question the Tnaiste and Enterprise Minister about the redundancies announced by SR Technics.  Ceann Comhairle John ODonoghue said the questions were part of Dil business and suspended Mr Broughan when he refused to drop the matter.  Earlier today, Roisn Shortall was formally suspended following a row with Mr O'Donoghue yesterday over questions to the Minister for Finance.  12/02/2009: Rabbitte demands all-party commission on banking practices  12/02/2009: Lenihan: I have done nothing wrong  12/02/2009: Kenny calls for Finance Ministers resignation  12/02/2009: Second Labour TD suspended from Dil  12/02/2009: Labour TD Shortall suspended from Dil  12/02/2009: Gormley mounts staunch defence of Brian Lenihan  12/02/2009: Govt unveils details of 7bn bank recapitalisation plan  11/02/2009: Govt unveils new banks bail-out  11/02/2009: Cowen: Govt unaware of bank's multi-billion euro loans  11/02/2009: Govt knew about deposit before Anglo nationalisation  10/02/2009: Former UK bank bosses 'profoundly sorry'  10/02/2009: FG proposes new banks with clean balance sheets  10/02/2009: Kenny: Govt must stand up to banks  10/02/2009: Cabinet set to approve bank recapitalisation plan  09/02/2009: Teachers to protest at Anglo Irish Bank offices  09/02/2009: RBS staff likely to get bonuses, admits Darling  09/02/2009: Government to seek substantial cut in bankers pay  08/02/2009: Gormley: Pay cuts for bank chiefs must be considered  08/02/2009: Fine Gael demand to see banks' books  07/02/2009: Taoiseach justifies 7bn bailout  06/02/2009: IL&amp;P in 1bn bond bid  28/01/2009: US stocks climb on reports of 'bad banks' plan  19/01/2009: Call for review of banking regulations  19/01/2009: Goggin stands down as Bank of Ireland chief executive  16/01/2009: Bankng giants suffer huge losses  16/01/2009: Anglo Irish Bank chairman apologises to shareholders  16/01/2009: EU launches investigation into Anglo Irish Bank nationalisation  16/01/2009: Further bailout for Bank of America  16/01/2009: Nationalised Anglo Irish Bank shares suspended
