Although HBOS closed at 282p on Friday, the stock price was well below 275p when the rights offer closed at 11am and has been languishing for weeks.HBOS is not alone. Barclays admitted last week that only 19 per cent of its investors had bought into its 4.5bn scheme. At least part of the problem for HBOS is its high proportion of small shareholders. It has the biggest small investor base in the UK, with 2.1 million holders making up 25 per cent of the company. But the biggest issue was the catastrophic impact on banking stocks of last week's crisis in the US over the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac state-backed mortgage fin-ance companies, which coincided with institutional investors' decision-making on the UK bank's rights issue.Barclays' unsuccessful rights issue was rescued last week by the bank's 'anchor' investors, including the Qatar Investment Authority.Interesting?
