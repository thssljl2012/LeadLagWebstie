 LONDON (ShareCast) - Just 19% of Barclays' open offer shares were taken up by existing shareholders as part of the bank's 4.5bn fundraising, the bank revealed Friday. That leaves Qatar Investment Authority, Challenger, China Development Bank, Temasek and institutional shareholders with the rest. Shareholders had the chance to buy shares at 282p each, but they've been below that price for the last week. The bank revealed in June that a clutch of sovereign wealth funds and Far East investors had agreed to back its cash call. About 0.5bn has been raised through a firm placing of 169m new shares at 296p, with the other 4bn bagged from the placing and open offer of 1.4bn shares on a 3 for 14 basis. The Qatar Investment Authority and fellow Qatari group Challenger agreed to invest up to 1.76bn and 533m respectively. Barclays said the funds raised would have raised its tier one ratio to 8.8% and its equity tier one ratio to 6.3% as at 31 December 2007 (on a Basel II basis). The new funds will also provide additional financial resources to allow Barclays to capture opportunities for growth, it said.
