 A DIVISION of banking major Barclays that pays pensions to more than 70,000 policyholders a month was yesterday reported to be the subject of takeover interest.Swiss Re is said to have been conducting due diligence on Barclays Life Assurance, which looks after policyholders' life, pension and investment plans. The business has more than 7 billion under management.As the division no longer writes new business, Barclays is thought to see the operation as non-core and offering the potential to raise cash.Estimates about how much the business might be worth vary from as little as 450 million to 750 million, according to a Sunday newspaper report.Barclays Life Assurance  part of Barclays Wealth  was created in 2003 when Woolwich Life and Barclays Life merged. Both firms stopped accepting new customers in 2001.There has been a flurry of consolidation activity in the life-book sector, culminating in last year's 5bn takeover of Clive Cowdery's Resolution group by Pearl Assurance.Swiss Re missed out in the battle for Resolution, but was last year successful in buying a fund from Zurich Financial Services with nearly 4bn under management.Specialist buyers increase the returns of the funds by putting the liabilities together and stripping out administrative costs.Barclays declined to comment on yesterday's developments.The bank recently secured a 4.5bn fundraising package as it rebuilds its balance sheet, drawn largely from Qatari and Asian investors.
