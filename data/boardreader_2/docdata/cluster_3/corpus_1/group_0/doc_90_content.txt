 Britain's banks were rocked today when Lloyds TSB reported a plunge in profits of 1.4bn - a 70% fall.The result was far worse than a pessimistic City was expecting and raised fears for high street rivals. HBOS, which owns Halifax, reports tomorrow and Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester the day after.Lloyds TSB blamed the global credit crunch and losses in its insurance business. The figures will heighten government fears that more small banks could collapse such as Northern Rock.Lloyds was regarded as the most conservative of the big banks and had won praise for resisting the temptation to make risky loans during the boom years.Lloyds said it expected house prices to fall by up to 15% this year, which would push tens of thousands of people into negative equity.Banks have come under fire from consumer groups for squeezing customers with high charges as they themselves struggle with the downturn.Critics of the industry say not enough banking bosses have accepted responsibility for their failures by resigning.Lloyds TSB chief executive Eric Daniels warned that the British economy was facing a sharp slowdown in the coming months, and will grow by only 1.6% this year - far lower than Treasury estimates of two per cent.He said the crisis in the financial markets and falling house prices 'have impacted consumer confidence and contributed to lower growth' in Britain in the last six months. Mr Daniels insisted that Lloyds TSB will continue to deliver a strong operating and financial performance.Lloyds TSB made 599m in the six months to June, down from almost 2bn a year ago. The bank said its underlying performance reflected good 'momentum'.But the City is now fearful of the future prospects for the company. Simon Pilkington, an analyst at Cazenove, said: 'The dividend is unsustainable. We perceive a long-term challenge to the group's capital position.'Bank shares across the world have collapsed this year in the wake of the credit crunch.This morning Lloyds TSB fell 15p to 306p. It insisted it will not have to raise fresh cash from investors unlike rivals. Royal Bank of Scotland Barclays and HBOS have all been forced to raise billions of pounds to shore up balance sheets.
