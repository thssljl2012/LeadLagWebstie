 (Adds background.) By Rebecca Thurlow Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- Information memorandums have been sent to Australian and international firms interested in buying  (GE) Wizard Home Loans, a person familiar with the situation said Wednesday.Some of Australia's major banks are among those interested in the unit, the person said. The information memorandums were sent this week to more than five parties, most of whom are 'strategic buyers', with little interest coming from private equity firms.It is speculated that the sale could bring in around A$280 million, based on the A$140 million acquisition of the franchise of smaller and financially troubled Rams Home Loans Group Ltd. by  (WBK) that was agreed in October, although some estimates have put the likely sale price closer to A$100 million.Wizard has a network of more than 250 franchised branches, compared to around 100 at Rams.It is hoped that indicative bids for the unit will be received within four or five weeks, the person said.General Electric's consumer finance arm, GE Money, said in May it was considering a possible sale of Wizard Home Loans.The decision comes in the wake of tougher trading conditions for non-bank lenders sparked by the global credit crunch.GE said it was also considering a strategic partnership or a joint venture as part of a review of the franchise lending business being conducted by Citigroup and JPMorgan.GE Money acquired Wizard's parent company, Australian Financial Investments Group, including a mortgage wholesale funding unit, in 2004.The takeover price wasn't disclosed but was estimated at around A$500 million.Australia's four major banks - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( CBA.AU), National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) and Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) - have withstood the global liquidity crisis relatively well when compared to many of their global peers, and remain well capitalized with strong balance sheets.It is little surprise that some of them are looking at opportunities to take advantage of the fallout of the global credit crunch on smaller players.The Australian newspaper reported in June that Wizard Chairman and founder Mark Bouris, and JPMorgan and Citi, were talking to National Australia Bank and ANZ about a possible sale.However, a person familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires in June that ANZ isn't closely looking at a possible purchase of Wizard, while NAB and ANZ spokespeople have declined to comment. -By Rebecca Thurlow, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2959; rebecca.thurlow@ dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=tbcz0xXX1Jauzo6mglEnJg%3D%3D.
