 ANZ Bank has been singled out ahead of other big Australian banks as most at risk of further material provisions because of its long credit default swap positions, potentially running to $2.4 billion, based on international comparisons.National Australia Bank is not far behind in the structured credit risk stakes, The Australian reports. According to a detailed note by investment bank Citi, which looks at the structured credit exposures of the top four banks, ANZ's big counterparty risk on CDS portfolios and NAB's large conduit liquidity line exposure 'sees us select ANZ and NAB as the most likely to incur provisions in future related to their dealings in these products'. ANZ's CDS exposure is estimated to be $23 billion, the highest of the big four. 'With a long CDS exposure of $23.4 billion, with many counterparties thought to be insurance companies subject to negative credit watch, we believe there is a very real possibility for further material provisions in future,' the note says. 'It is easy to envisage additional provisions of a similar magnitude to those already disclosed ($200 million each) or potentially much larger ($1 billion to $2 billion) given where international benchmarks appear to sit.' In February, ANZ was forced to make a provision of $226 million related to US monoline insurer ACA Capital, after the insurer's credit rating was reduced.  Share this article
