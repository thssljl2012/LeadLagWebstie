  By Peter TaylorThe collapse in the value of Britain's high street banks is continuing today, with Royal Bank of Scotland now worth little more than half the 49bn paid for ABN Amro last year. In another torrid day for the sector, shares in HBOS, the owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland, fell another 32p in trading early this afternoon to 228p - 47p below the price of new equity in the bank's 4bn rights issue that closes in two days. Subscribers to the 12bn RBS rights issue, which closed on June 6, have already seen more than 25pc, or 3bn, wiped from the value of their investment. As fears about the health of the US economy and banking sector continued to ripple around the world, shares in RBS, which has significant exposure to the American market, were trading at less than 150p this afternoon compared with the 200p rights issue price.On paper, RBS would now be able to buy HBOS with change to spare from the 10bn it paid as the lead partner in the 49bn takeover of Dutch group ABN Amro last year.HBOS, which was valued at more than 43bn in February last year, was this afternoon worth a fraction above 8.5bn. Although speculation has centred on major HBOS investors supporting the bank's rights issue, fears are intensifying that underwriters Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort will be left with a huge overhang of unsold shares.The other British banks were also dragged lower as sentiment soured. Barclays was down 17.5p to 243p while Lloyds TSB fell 16p to 257p. Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley shares were trading almost 2p lower at 47p ahead of the bank's extraordinary meeting tomorrow where shareholders will vote on the group's 400m rights issue at 55p a share, which is being backed by the lead investors.
