 rimebroker Securities Ltd - the stock lending and margin loan division of the troubled Chimaera Financial Group - has appointed its own voluntary administrators.The appointment comes after Primebroker's financial backer, ANZ Banking Group Ltd, appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers as receiver and manager over the margin lender on July 4.Primebroker directors said the appointment of Laurie Fitzgerald and Michael Humphris as voluntary administrators was preferable to 'simply allowing the company to fall into liquidation'. On June 30 ANZ backed out of a $55 million rescue package to Chimaera following due diligence.ANZ is expected to book a $50 million provision over Primebroker and said that legal proceedings against the firm had been to its detriment.Chimaera has signalled possible legal retaliation against ANZ, saying the bank's move on Primebroker may cause its financial collapse while it seeks a last-minute suitor.
