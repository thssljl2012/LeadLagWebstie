 NAB chief executive John Stewart may become the highest-profile Australian casualty of the credit crunch, according to reports today.Speculation was rife the Scottish-born executive may shortly hand over the reins to the head of NAB's New Zealand operation, Cameron Clyne, The Australian reports. Mr Clyne, 40, and one of a number of internal CEO aspirants, has been running the NZ operations since January last year, lifting cash earnings by 15 per cent in the March half-year from $NZ208 million ($161 million) to $NZ239 million. There are suggestions that the NAB board, which convened at short notice last week ahead of Friday's  and will gather for a further meeting today, recently activated its succession plan. A spokesman would not be drawn, saying Mr Stewart, who took the top job in 2004 and is on a rolling contract, was willing to stay until the board had formed a view on succession. 'There are a range of internal candidates and any such decision would have to be announced to the stock exchange,' he said. Mr Clyne heads the list of internal candidates, which includes chief financial officer Mark Joiner and CEO Australia Ahmed Fahour, whose odds have lengthened despite his having engineered a strong turnaround in the critical domestic business. Despite his sound credentials, any elevation of Mr Clyne will not win universal support. 'Cameron Clyne could be very good, but the criticism of NAB is that they perennially lock themselves into their existing strategy with internal appointments,' one close observer said. 'Don Argus handed over to Frank Cicutto, who handed over to John Stewart, and he'd only been running NAB in Europe for a short time. 'If you look at NAB's performance, you'd have to say that a true international search wouldn't come up with an internal candidate.' The banking sector was hammered again yesterday, as investors absorbed a bleak assessment from the International Monetary Fund, as well as NAB's $830 million provision on Friday and a further $1.4 billion set aside by ANZ on Monday. It was Commonwealth Bank's turn to lead the sector down, shedding $1.77, or 4.3 per cent, to $39.33. NAB plummeted $1.02, or 3.95 per cent, to $24.78, while ANZ was down a further 28c, or 1.8 per cent, to $15.53. Read the complete story on The Australian's website.Share this article
