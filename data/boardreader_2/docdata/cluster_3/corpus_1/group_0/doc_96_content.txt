 LONDON (Thomson Financial) - HBOS is expected to reveal on Monday how many investors have taken up its offer of new shares in the mortgage bank, with the Observer suggesting the 4 billion pounds rights issue has been 'one of the biggest fund-raising flops in UK corporate history'. Media reports have suggested that the rights issue has had a low uptake, due to concerns about the group's falling share price and its exposure to the property market.The shares closed Friday at 282 pence, 7 pence above the rights issue price of 275 pence per share.Almost all the new shares on offer to existing investors will be left with underwriting banks Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort, who will offer 2.5 million new shares to big City investors as soon as HBOS announces the take-up figure, the Observer reported.The HBOS take-up will be far lower than the 19 percent who subscribed to last week's Barclays' offer, which had to be rescued by 'anchor' investors such as the Qatar Investment Authority, the newspaper said. philip.waller@thomsonreuters.com paw/roInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
