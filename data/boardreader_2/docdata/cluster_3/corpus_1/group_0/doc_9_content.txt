  By Katherine GriffithsRoyal Bank of Scotland shares fell 9pc after a swathe of bad news about the global economy and a setback to the sale of its insurance business hit the banking giant. Sentiment was also affected by whether the US administration would have to bail out Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which stand behind many US mortgages. Many banks, including UK lenders, have invested in American mortgages backed by the two. A bail-out might not hit the value of these investments but would probably damage sentiment further among investors. Amidst a sea of red in the banking sector, RBS was hit the hardest, closing down 17.2p at 182.7p and below the 200p a share its record 12bn rights issue was priced at.Analysts said yesterday RBS faced the prospect of not being able to sell its insurance division, whose flagship brand is Direct Line.Zurich Financial Services, seen as the front runner, pulled out of the auction on Thursday. That leaves just Allstate of the US and Germany's Allianz out of a list of eight potential trade buyers.RBS put its insurance business up for sale when it announced its rights issue in April. Sir Fred Goodwin, RBS's chief executive, only wanted to part with the business, which also includes Churchill and Privilege, at a price of between 6.5bn and 7.5bn. Sandy Chen of Panmure Gordon yesterday said RBS was more likely to get 5bn to 5.5bn if it does press ahead with a sale. This would net between 1.5bn and 2bn in capital gains, compared to the 4bn RBS was hoping for.RBS is progressing with other disposals. It is about to sell the Australian business it picked up as part of the ABN Amro buyout. National Australia Bank yesterday announced it was close to striking a deal with RBS. The price could be about 216m.
