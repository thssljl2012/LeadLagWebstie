          The company will have more cash yes but the same can be achieved by buying before the dilution cheaper and thus my point is why bother to take up the offer.   Yes, but note it&amp;#039;s not the average price that you need to be able to buy in below. It is the price of the new issue, which is 282p, and to my knowledge, the Barclays share price has not yet got there (currently at 292.25p to buy). Although, of course, it could, and if it did go below that price, the best thing to do might be to buy the equivalent number of new shares (or more) that you were entitled to under the new issue and then not subscribe to the issue. However, the buying effect if everyone did that might just push the share price up !  Personally, I have until the 11th July to decide (with Barclays Stockbrokers) and I intend to wait and see what happens. I will be taking up my rights either through the issue or through buying directly in the market if the opportunity presents itself - Barclays looks like a reasonable play over the longer term and I&amp;#039;m still happy to support them.  Cheers, Steve,
