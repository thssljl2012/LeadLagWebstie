 I just finished his book.  Very interesting read...

I included a section recommending them in my current book. I am now about to eat some crow, change my mind, and correct future printings.     I told you that I would watch very closely to see if we could be sure they were actually buying the bullion that their shares represented. Ive made a lot of money in ETFs, and so have a lot of my subscribers.     There is now some doubt whether Barclays always buys the necessary gold or silver bullion behind the shares. My biggest concerns are with SLV, the silver ETF; I dont have enough data yet on the gold ETF.     We do know that sometimes Barclays has created new shares of SLV and sold them to investors, but havent bought the underlying silver. It is evident that there is a genuine shortage of wholesale silver at these prices, and it may not be their fault, but Barclays, who owns SLV, has been less than candid in disclosing the problem. They have been short as much as 25-million ounces of silver from time to time. They could, if they choose, sell you the shares of SLV, take your money and not buy the required metal that customers have been promised. This can give them capital at no cost to them.     Barclays is like most giant brokerage houses. They currently have some cash problems, even looking for cash investments from foreign funds. But this is a good way for them to have cash without having to buy the metal, even though it is probably not their fault originally. But it does redound to their benefit, and it is illegal as hell.     They can sell shares of SLV, take the cash and not buy the metal; even though it is possible they are trying to buy some silver, but cant get any. There is a lot of evidence of shortages of silver right now, and it is only the mass shorting of the metal in the futures market that Ted Butler has written about that has kept the price depressed.      Ted claims this is ultimately bullish and says, What makes this (shorting) so bullish for silver is that there is only one good reason to make it short-sell its SLV shares because the available silver needed to be purchased and put into the custodians vault doesnt exist. Rather than go out and aggressively bid up the price of world silver, it is infinitely easier just to sell shares of SLV short. No one would be the wiser and it keeps the price nice and orderly. But this confirms that real silver may be unavailable in wholesale quantities. In other words, this would be proof of a wholesale shortage of silver to go along with a retail shortage.     Eventually those futures-market shorts will have to be covered, and it will bring a lot of buying into the market place to cover the short positions.     An ETF can accumulate a lot of cash by shorting their own customers. The customer buys and thinks he is long in silver, and the ETF doesnt buy the silver, so they are short the silver. In the short run, a short sale has a depressing effect on the market, but in the long run, a large market short position means a pile of buying ahead. Ultimately, the big shorts will be responsible for an upward explosion in the price of silver.     Here are my suggestions:     1) Dont liquidate SLV all at once; sell it gradually a bit at a time. This is not a panic emergency. You will incur some tax liability, but the ETF will be treated like any security, so it will be normal capital gains, assuming youve had profits.     2) Dont give up on silver. It will go a lot higher. There are other forms of silver you can switch to, which I have done. They consist of (a) Central Fund of Canada Ltd. (AMEX:CEF), a mutual fund which I know buys the gold and silver they are required to buy. When you buy shares of CEF, they buy gold and silver at the rate of one ounce of gold to 50-ounces of silver. It is a simple way to benefit from gold and silver; or (b) you can buy actual physical silver and store it at home. Some people consider this inconvenient, but it is by far the safest thing to do. You can buy silver from any of my recommended dealers. Remember to always shop around; Ive listed them here for your convenience.

You will actually be given the serial numbers on your bars. To buy 1,000-ounce bars costs more than $18,000 per bar.     Again, dont give up on silver. The huge short positions mean a lot of future buying power will eventually pour into the silver market and make it explode upward in value sooner or later.     I have adjusted the Investment Menu in The Ruff Times (you can subscribe at  www.rufftimes.com ) to reflect these changes.     Uncle Sams Share     The second issue is a tax matter. Most tax preparers take the IRS position and assume that all gold and silver bullion and bullion coins will be treated as collectibles and capital gains will be taxed at the rate of 28 percent. We are still doing our homework, but I can tell you what I do know.     If the bullion is the same degree of fineness as the regulated futures market contracts, its treated as a commodity and taxed as such. Gold must be .9995 pure, silver must be .9990 pure, platinum and palladium must be .9995 pure. Most common bullion coins, such as U.S. Eagles, meet those requirements, so when you sell, they will not be taxed as collectibles at 28 percent. They will be of appropriate fineness, and your profit should be taxed at the ordinary capital-gains tax rate.     The IRS wants to argue with you and treat all bullion as collectibles, but a collectible has value because of investor opinions that are unrelated to intrinsic value, and there are no standardized market price quotes.     A rare coin is a collectible, and its value has nothing to do with its bullion content. It may or may not have bullion in it, but that does not determine its value.     A semi-numismatic coin, which a lot of coin dealers sell, is kind of a hybrid. It has some bullion value, but the largest part of its value is based on its condition, age and scarcity, and it is a true collectible.     To call bullion a collectible, which the IRS is doing, is a real rip off, and though the IRS regs seem to support it, the IRS code is silent on this matter, and court rulings have gone against them, which they have ignored. Unfortunately, a lot of conflict-averse tax preparers have simply gone along with the IRS. We are doing further research to see how we can deal with that issue. It is clear that it should be treated like any other commodity. I will contact my friends in Congress once we have completed our homework. This looks a job for Super Advisor Howard.
