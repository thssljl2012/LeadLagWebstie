Keith &amp;quot;government bonds&amp;quot;   Like Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (agencies)   CMOs????    OR &amp;quot;government securities&amp;quot; such as Treasury Bonds which are safe?  THERE&amp;#039;S A HUGE DIFFERENCE.   And I think PayPal (Barclays) is NOT invested in Treasuries but the former... agencies
