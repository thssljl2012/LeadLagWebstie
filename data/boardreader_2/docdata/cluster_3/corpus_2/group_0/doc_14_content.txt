        QUOTE(Ray Lewis&amp;#039;s Limo Driver &amp;amp;#064; Jun 30 2008, 08&amp;amp;#58;40 PM)        Lehman can no longer hide its failures    Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. plunged as traders speculated the fourth- largest U.S. securities firm may be sold for less than its market value.    Lehman dipped as low as &amp;amp;#036;19.61 before closing at &amp;amp;#036;19.81, down &amp;amp;#036;2.44, or 10.6%, on the day.  Barclays&amp;#039; would purportedly pick up Lehman at a steep discount, which explains the tumble once the story broke.  Lehman, which recouped some of its loss in after-hours trading, will be a focus Tuesday morning, as investors turn the page on a brutal month.   If you were paying attention you dumped this stock back in March when I told you this company was going to fail, if you are strike then you didn&amp;#039;t have anything invested in this company anyways so you don&amp;#039;t give a crap.    Tuesday should be an interestingday for the Lehman company....     FYP.  Still waiting for you to explain how I refinanced at 4.875%.  And for your &amp;amp;quot;thesis&amp;amp;quot;.  One has to wonder why you&amp;#039;re so afraid to have your &amp;amp;quot;thesis&amp;amp;quot; critiqued.  ROFLMAO.      Holy crap.  3 of your links are to the same focking story&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;   Is that how one tries to show a story is credible?  Change the heading on the link but link to the same story?  WOW&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;  I guess you have to write a &amp;amp;quot;thesis&amp;amp;quot; to be that smart&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;
