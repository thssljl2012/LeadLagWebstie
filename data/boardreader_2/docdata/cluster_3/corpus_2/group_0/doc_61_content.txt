         First FSA lifeboat launched:   http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sect...    The FSA chief already had an alternative plan ready to go in the form of rescue backing promised by four investment houses: Prudential, Legal &amp;amp; General, the HBOS-owned Insight and Standard Life. .....  Six of Britain&amp;amp;#8217;s biggest clearing banks &amp;amp;#8211; Abbey, HBOS, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Lloyds TSB &amp;amp;#8211; are also understood to have agreed to take some of the sub-underwriting.   Citigroup and UBS remain the lead underwriters. Under a new underwriting agreement, they are said to be fully committed and unable to use rating agency downgrades to get off the hook.    I imagine there will be several more of these in due course. The banks and highly-exposed institutional investors closing ranks and trying to bail out rather than let a major player go.....because they know full well that they&amp;#039;d ALL be stuffed if they didn&amp;#039;t cough up!  ee
