  Here&amp;#039;s another report of the actions taken by National Australia Bank. They are realizing 55% loss on foreclosed properties, and have now written off about 90% of their US based mortgage related debt. If this is indicative of the losses expected on the larger portfolios held by some institutions (Fannie, Freddie), then we do appear to be in uncharted waters.                 Bad debt bombshell from National Australia Bank    Article from:          Ben Butler  July 26, 2008 12:00am          THENational Australia Bank has effectively kissed goodbye to $1 billion itpoured into ill-fated securities backed by home mortgages in the US.    NAB chief executive John Stewart yesterday revealed the bank was increasing its bad debt provision onthe securities by $830 million, which comes on top of $181 milliondisclosed in May.   Mr Stewart denied NAB had a credibility problem, saying it had &amp;quot;been open and honest with the market&amp;quot;.   He said the surprise provision would not result in a cut to the bank&amp;#039;s dividend, job losses or increases in home loan rates.   But it would cut about $600 million from its profit.   NAB shares plunged on the news, leading the share market tumble yesterday.   The stock closed 13.5 per cent, or $4.14, lower at $26.56.   Other bank stocks were also hit, with ANZ dropping $1.70 to $17.75 and the Commonwealth Bank shedding $3.14 to $43.25.   Last night ratings agency Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s put the NAB onnegative credit watch, warning the bank&amp;#039;s AA rating was at risk ifNAB&amp;#039;s credit costs blew out or investors deserted the bank.   Mr Stewart said the global credit crisis was worse than he hadthought and had yet to hit bottom. &amp;quot;The worst-case scenario might notbe too far away from the most likely scenario,&amp;quot; he said.   Mr Stewart took a swipe at ratings agencies, saying they had not done a &amp;quot;thorough&amp;quot; job when giving the securities a AAA rating.   He declared the bank would &amp;quot;make the same investment decision (today)&amp;quot; based on the information it had.   &amp;quot;If you wouldn&amp;#039;t invest in AAA assets then you wouldn&amp;#039;t invest in any company in Australia,&amp;quot; Mr Stewart said.   NAB estimates the global banking sector is less than halfway through the credit crisis.   Figures supplied by NAB show global bank losses are expected to hit between $1 trillion and $1.3 trillion.   So far banks have lost $410 billion.  &amp;quot;The US mortgage crisis,which started with sub-prime, has moved to other classes of mortgagesincluding prime, resulting in the recent US Government move to rescueFannie Mae and Freddie Mac,&amp;quot; Mr Stewart said.   He said NAB wasleading the way worldwide in making provisions against losses from whatare known as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), usually backed byhome mortgages, and held off balance sheet by the banks in vehiclescalled &amp;quot;conduits&amp;quot;.   &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;d argue we were very early,&amp;quot; he said.   &amp;quot;Very few banks in the world are adding their conduits (to loss provisions).&amp;quot;   Representatives of the other three big Australian banks denied any problems with CDOs (see separate story on page 91).   MrStewart played down a report in a British newspaper that the bank wasprobably part of a consortium planning to break up troubled UK bankinggiant HBOS.   The report, in The Daily Telegraph, said NAB wastipped to buy Bankwest, the Australian division of HBOS, and might alsobe interested in HBOS&amp;#039;s corporate banking arm.   Asked about the report, Mr Stewart said: &amp;quot;We have a very low appetite for acquisitions at the moment.&amp;quot;   NabCapital chief executive John Hooper, who oversaw the bank&amp;#039;s move into US housing-backed securities, expressed his regret.   &amp;quot;Itake this matter extraordinarily seriously, both personally andparticularly for the vast majority of my staff who have workedextraordinarily hard and now find themselves waylaid by thisdifficulty,&amp;quot; he said.   Mr Stewart defended the bank&amp;#039;s decision to buy the securities.   &amp;quot;Thereis very little to be learned from this other than the quality of theratings agencies and that dislocations can happen,&amp;quot; he said.   &amp;quot;There was no way anyone could have predicted the dire state of the US housing market.&amp;quot;   Bankexecutives said US houses seized from owners who failed to pay theirloans now took a year to sell and might fetch just half of theoutstanding mortgage.   &amp;quot;A 55 per cent loss for housing would be miles away from anyone&amp;#039;s expectation in a mature economy,&amp;quot; Mr Stewart said.   Hesaid the &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot; nature of CDOs &amp;quot;can often have an acceleratingeffect&amp;quot; in a downturn, especially with no secondary market where thebank could sell the securities.   &amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s just not investor appetite for these securities at the moment,&amp;quot; he said.   Yesterday&amp;#039;sdecision slashed the value of the bank&amp;#039;s portfolio of CDOs backed by USresidential mortgages from $1.2 billion to just $161 million.   Mr Stewart said there were no problems with another $13.2 billion worth of CDOs in the bank&amp;#039;s conduits.   About$4.5 billion is backed by corporate securities and commercial realestate loans and another $8.7 billion is backed by loans to NABcustomers.   &amp;quot;There is nothing unusual happening in both these books,&amp;quot; Mr Stewart said.   But he warned that economic pain in Europe and the US would spread to Australia.   &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t expect to get away unscathed,&amp;quot; he said.   &amp;quot;(But) we don&amp;#039;t anticipate right now a major slowdown in the Australian economy.&amp;quot;   He said the bank did not need to raise mortgage rates &amp;quot;right now&amp;quot; but the global crisis was squeezing bank margins.   &amp;quot;You should know that the cost of funds is increasing all the time&amp;quot; he said.
