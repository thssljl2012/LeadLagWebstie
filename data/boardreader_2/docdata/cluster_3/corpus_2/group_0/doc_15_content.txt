         I own share in Barclays, B&amp;amp;B and HBOS - all bought at MUCH higher prices than the current prices. I know I should have sold long ago but never expected the shares to fall so low. I wonder if I should take up the rights issue or just leave matters alone and hope things may get better? What will happen if I dont do anything about my shares? Some of them are with Self Trade in nominee account and some are in paper certificates.
