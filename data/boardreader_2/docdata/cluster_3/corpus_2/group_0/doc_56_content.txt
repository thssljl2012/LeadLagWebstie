The bank&amp;#039;s standard variable rate home loan will increase from 9.44 per cent to 9.58 per cent from Monday for both new and existing customers and its basic variable home loan from 8.93 per cent to 9.07 per cent.    http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2...11/2300966.htm                       This is exactly why i generally like investing in bank stocks.  The big for banks operate in a unique environment that is not replicated anywhere else in the world.  They have an entrenched market position and in effect operate as a weak form of oligopoly.   The going gets tough, now the banks start clawing back their margins, and what can the market do about it? nothing    2008 and probably 2009 are going to be tough years.  But if you can see through the current market jitters, the big 4 banks could actually benefit from the credit crisis.   Even after the passage of the credit crisis, we are unlikely to revert back to the days of easy credit.  The markets been there already and been burnt, it will probably take 10 -15yrs before the next generation of investors &amp;#039;forget&amp;#039; about the dangers of accepting lax lending standards.   Therefore there will be less lending competition which should see the banks restore their traditional lending margins (which has been eroding for the last 10yrs).  If lending margins fatten, then less lending is required to achieve the same profit.      The current market is actually VERY favourable for long term retail investors.  There are not many circumstances where the retail investor has edge over institutional investors.  At the moment institutional investors have their hands tied by   1) unit redemptions and loss of investment mandates   2) their need to show short term outperformance to maintain and build their funds under management.   A private investor is not accountable to anyone, and thus can build a portfolio based on long term investment criteria rather than trying to select which industry/sector/stock is going to out perform in the next 6-12 months.
