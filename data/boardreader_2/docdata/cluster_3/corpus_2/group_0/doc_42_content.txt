I know it costs, but it might work out better in the long run if you can get a lower rate.      Did you try HSB?      Bev                        Tried HSB but they couldn&amp;#039;t help. I also talked to people at the mortgage brokers John Charcol but they couldn&amp;#039;t deal with this. Barclays could arrange a Euro mortgage (or a mortgage in some other currencies such as USD) through their Knightbridge branch (which handles Wealth management).      My thinking was that a Euro mortgage would have two  advantages for us       1). A lower interest rate (although that has largely diasappeared as the Euro interest rates have increased so that we would have to pay around 6% for a 10 or 20 year fix.      2). It would provide a form of currency hedge. By moving back to the UK but being paid in Euros we are vunerable if in the future sterling strengthens against the euro. I know this doesn&amp;#039;t seem very likely at the moment!      Where we live in the Netherlands there are also vast waves of retirees moving to southern Europe. As a result Dutch banks are now offering mortgages for properties in other countries within the euro zone. However it seems that they will also be able to arrange a mortgage in the UK if we want it.
