  again,this will affect canadian financials   toxic CDOs Given Up for Dead Coming to Life With Pension Funds    By Jody Shenn       July 8 (Bloomberg) -- CDOs are back.       Collateralized debt obligations that helped drive banks to$400 billion of writedowns and credit losses are finding buyersunder a different name: Re-Remics.        Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co. and at leastsix other firms are repackaging unwanted mortgage bonds as salesof CDOs composed of asset-backed securities fall to less than $1billion this year from $227 billion in 2007 because of the globalcredit crunch. Re-Remics contain parts that are structured toguard against higher losses on underlying loans than most CDOs,allowing holders to sell or retain other sections at lower pricesthat can translate to potential yields of more than 20 percent.       ``It&amp;#039;s just the reincarnation of the CDO,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said  PaulColonna , who manages more than $100 billion as chief investmentofficer for fixed income at GE Asset Management in Stamford,Connecticut. ``The mechanics are the same, but you&amp;#039;re getting inat a much different level of valuation.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       GE Asset Management has considered buying the debt, Colonnasaid. The  General Electric Co.  unit may also have Re-Remics madeout of bonds it owns if disposing of the riskier pieces booststhe securities&amp;#039; overall value.       Re-Remic stands for ``resecuritizations of real estatemortgage investment conduits,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; the formal name of mortgagebonds. Sales of the securities may help revive the market for newhome-loan debt, according to  Bernard Maas , an analyst in New Yorkat credit-rating firm DBRS Ltd.       `Look to Restart&amp;#039;       ``The hope is that by moving illiquid bonds to interestedparties, the structured-finance community can look to restart,&amp;#039;&amp;#039;he said.       More than $9.3 billion of Re-Remics were created in thefirst five months of 2008, almost triple a year ago, according toInside MBS &amp;amp;amp; ABS. The debt represented 47 percent of mortgagebonds issued in the period, excluding those guaranteed by  FannieMae ,  Freddie Mac  or Ginnie Mae.       A record $25 billion of Re-Remics were formed in 2007, thenewsletter said. Sales in 2008 may exceed that, according to Sharon Greenberg , a Barclays Capital analyst in New York.       Unlike most CDOS, Re-Remics don&amp;#039;t own debt or credit-defaultswaps based on the lowest-ranking subprime mortgage-bond classes.They are composed of AAA rated bonds backed by so-called Alt-Amortgages, issued to borrowers with higher credit scores whodon&amp;#039;t prove their incomes, seek higher debt ratios or buyinvestment properties.       Few Bonds       While CDOs are backed by more than a hundred bonds, Re-Remics typically combine fewer than a dozen, allowing holders tomore easily analyze the debt.       Holders of mortgage bonds use Re-Remics to separate better-quality from riskier debt. That increases the chance the higher-ranked debt will retain its AAA rating, enhancing its valueenough to boost the total worth of the mortgage pool, said  DougDachille , chief executive officer of New York-based FirstPrinciples Capital Management LLC, which oversees $7 billion infixed-income investments.       Lower-ranked pieces of the Re-Remics would be the first torecord losses from defaults on the underlying mortgages, oncelower-ranking bonds from the initial deals are wiped out,Dachille said.       A bond trading at 40 cents on the dollar could be split intoa piece worth 80 cents and another piece that could then be soldcheaply enough to offer returns as high as 20 percent, Dachillesaid. Banks advised by First Principles bought lower-yieldingsenior pieces and some are also considering buying the bonds fortheir pension funds, he said. The firm is also starting a fundfor pension clients that would invest in the debt, Dachille said.       `Credit Support&amp;#039;       ``A lot of the stuff they wouldn&amp;#039;t buy without theadditional credit support,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said. ``They&amp;#039;re happy with the7.5 percent return. They just wanted greater certainty thatthey&amp;#039;re going to get that 7.5 percent return.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       Transamerica Life Insurance Co., a unit of the Hague-based Aegon NV , is among holders of Re-Remics created this year by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , according to data compiled byBloomberg. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co., a unit ofWilmington, Delaware-based  Delphi Financial Group Inc. , owns aRe-Remic created by  Countrywide Financial Corp. , the data show. Cindy Nodorft , an Aegon spokeswoman, declined to comment . BernardKilkelly , a spokesman at Delphi, didn&amp;#039;t return a message.       ``It&amp;#039;s one of the few cases where re-securitization actuallyincreases, rather than destroys, value,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said  Scott Simon , headof mortgage-backed bonds at Pacific Investment Management Co. Hewouldn&amp;#039;t disclose whether the Newport Beach, California-basedfirm, the world&amp;#039;s largest fixed-income manager, has bought thedebt or used Re-Remics to repackage debt held by its funds.       $370 Billion       Commercial banks and savings-and-loans held more than $370billion of non-agency mortgage bonds on March 31, according toFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. Much of that can only besold at fire-sale prices after record subprime-mortgage defaultsand  home-price declines  sparked losses on the underlying loans.       ``This is an attempt to shake things up,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said  Scott Kirby ,who manages about $20 billion of structured-finance securities atAmeriprise Financial Inc.&amp;#039;s RiverSource Investments LLC inMinneapolis. ``There&amp;#039;s a lot of paper floating around that&amp;#039;shaving difficulty finding a home.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       CDOs, once the  fastest-growing part  of the debt markets,tumbled to zero cents on the dollar and credit ratings on someAAA pieces were cut to junk levels.       Goldman Sachs, based in New York, had about $15 billion ofresidential-mortgage securities on its books as of May 30, ChiefFinancial Officer  David Viniar  said on a conference call lastmonth. New York-based JPMorgan&amp;#039;s investment bank had $12.8billion of prime and Alt-A securities as of March 31, accordingto an investor presentation in April.  Lehman  had $15 billion ofhome-loan assets as of May 30, CFO  Ian Lowitt  said on aconference call last month.       Restructuring Needed       ``There are ample bonds that would fit the description ofneeding restructuring,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Greenberg, the Barclays analyst, said.       Banks can increase the total credit quality of their assetsby selling off lower-rated pieces and keeping the better part, Matthew Jozoff , an analyst at JPMorgan said. Avoiding downgradesalso would prevent the banks from having to hold more capital toprotect against losses on the debt.       Goldman spokesman  Michael Duvally , JPMorgan spokeswoman Tasha Pelio  and Lehman spokesman  Mark Lane  declined to comment.       Riskier Re-Remic mortgage securities are ``natural fit&amp;#039;&amp;#039; forhedge funds, according to a June 27 report by JPMorgan&amp;#039;s Jozoffand John Sim. The debt offers higher potential yields at a timewhen it&amp;#039;s difficult to borrow to boost returns, they wrote.       Re-Remics have repackaged so-called non-agency mortgagesecurities, which lack explicit or implied government guarantees,for at least 15 years. Re-securitizations of agency mortgagebonds date to the mid-1980s under First Boston&amp;#039;s  Laurence Fink ,now chief executive officer of  BlackRock Inc. , and  Lewis Ranieri of Salomon Brothers, now chairman of Ranieri &amp;amp;amp; Co., Franklin BankCorp. and Root Markets Inc.       Today&amp;#039;s Re-Remics are ``an opportunity for dealers to findliquidity and to move bonds out of their inventory,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said DBRS&amp;#039;sMaas.
