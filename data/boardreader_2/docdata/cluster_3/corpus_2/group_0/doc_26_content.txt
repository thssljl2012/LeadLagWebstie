             QUOTE (Justice &amp;amp;#064; Jul 18 2008, 09&amp;amp;#58;34 AM)       Looks like new rights isues are going to be dead ducks too.  I know the only way to solve the worlds troubles is to globalize all banks under the FED&amp;#039;s protection.  RB it&amp;#039;s a shame you did not get out of USD and into euro&amp;#039;s when i told you      Euro&amp;#039;s?  Wouldn&amp;#039;t want to be long on those.  Sarkozy has already more or less warned the German bloc that they will break the Euro if they have to and the recent formation of the Meditteranean Club is an indication that when things start to get really bad its everyone for themselves and the Med Club cannot afford the Euro at anything like today&amp;#039;s levels.  The Euro is untried and untested.  Its not much older than a decade and has never seen a downturn.  As we all know, this one is no ordinary downturn.  The US were &amp;amp;quot;first in first out&amp;amp;quot; and have responded to the HPC quicker and with greater efficiency.   As of now the banks are being sold to our &amp;amp;quot;friends&amp;amp;quot; in China and the Middle East with a large chunk of Barclays about to be handed over following the failure of the rights issue to attrcat more than 19% of existing shareholders.  Many more of our institutions will be controlled by these forces in the cmoing years which leads me to supsect there is less to fear from our old enemy, the USA, than there is from our &amp;amp;quot;friends&amp;amp;quot; in China and the ME.  My guess is that sterling will drop to around 1.80 before this year is out and the Euro should revert to somewhere around 1.40 unless something catastrophic happens in the EZ, such as a major bank failure.    IMO sterling is the most vulnerable of all currencies as it remains near its peak and things are not going well for the miracle these days.  The Euro is probably a little safer than sterling but I would steer clear of both.   BTW, your avatar shows BP and Royal Dutch Shell as part of GWB&amp;#039;s plan to control OPEC.  They are UK and Dutch companies.  Along with Total and GAZPROM they control most of the world&amp;#039;s refining and distribution capacity.  I am not so sure that GWB controls OPEC though.  Comrade Putin has far more influence now that he is &amp;amp;quot;helping&amp;amp;quot; the Iranians with their oil industry.

Here is where I think (as at 13th March 2008) the miracle economy will go this year*:  1. House prices down in  reality  terms by AT LEAST 20%.  E.g. 200k house becomes a 160k house 2. &amp;amp;quot;Growth&amp;amp;quot; in negative figures by the 3rd Q (+1.25% 1st Q, 0.5% 2nd Q, -1.0% 3rd Q, -1.75% 4th Q 3. Sterling down to 1.80 vs. the US&amp;amp;#036; and 1.10 vs. the Euro 4. CPI 3.5% by the end of the 2nd Q (Real inflation somewhere north of 6%) 5. Unemployment 6% by the end of the 1st H  *HPC &amp;amp;quot;expert&amp;amp;quot; Minos&amp;#039;s projections were as follows:  1. 2. 3. 4. 5.    By the time the crash finally comes to a rest, house prices will have dropped by 50-60% making a formerly 400k house 200k or less.    &amp;amp;quot;It looks likely that the sharp fall to the downside in house prices will by the 2nd Q of 2007&amp;amp;quot; RB 2006  &amp;amp;quot;Half of England&amp;#039;s regions have experienced falling house prices since the summer as the market has cooled decisively, the FT House Price index shows.&amp;amp;quot;  Financial Times 10th November 2007.  Mervyn King of the Bank of England warned in 2006 that house prices are a matter of opinion whereas debt is real.
