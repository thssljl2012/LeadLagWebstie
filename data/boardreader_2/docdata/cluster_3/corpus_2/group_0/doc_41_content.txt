  We are wanting to return to the UK in the next few months (when we have sold our own house here in Holland). I discussed the mortgage situation with the bank manager at Lloydstsb (where I have had an a/c for over 30 years) where my parents live. She didn&amp;#039;t think we would have any difficulty getting a mortgage but that is also because our LTV will be quite low as we have a lot of equity in our Dutch house.      However I had hoped I might be able to get a mortgage in Euros (since I continue to receive income in Euros as I have taken early retirement from my Dutch employer and in any case Euro rates are lower than in Sterling). This turns out to be rather difficult as UK banks don&amp;#039;t generally offer this. We did try Barclays which was the only UK bank to offer Euro mortgages in the UK but they were only interested if we wanted to borrow a minimum of 500keuros (because of the high cost of setting up such a mortgage).       We also talked with our bank here in the Netherlands (ABN-AMRO) about getting a Euro mortgage on a UK property. It seems this may be possible although the arrangement fee will be quite high because of the extra paperwork involved.
