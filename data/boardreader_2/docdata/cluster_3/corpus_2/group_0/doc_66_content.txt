 St George Bank have set the trend this afternoon with another round of interest rate increases by upping their Standard Variable Rate by 20 basis points to 9.57%.       The Dragon reported that whilst it had completed it wholesale funding agreement for this financial year the pressure on the spread between the cash rate and the 90 day remains higher than this time last year and could not rule out further increase.      I am sure they will not be alone so brace yourself for another round of letters.
