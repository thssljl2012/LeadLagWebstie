         &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;Issuers do many things in their own interest which are counter to the interests of shareholders&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  Venice: &amp;amp;quot;Incorrect. The issuer is Barclays and you, as a shareholder, own Barclays. The directors are legally obliged to work in the best interest of the shareholders.&amp;amp;quot;  Well do you work for Barclays Venice?  Shareholders do not control Barclays.  Shareholders own Barclays shares and provide capital on occasions such as these.  It&amp;#039;s the Barclays board who control Barclays. It&amp;#039;s quite easy to visualise circumstances where the interests of the Barclays board don&amp;#039;t coincide with the interests of a particular individual shareholder.
