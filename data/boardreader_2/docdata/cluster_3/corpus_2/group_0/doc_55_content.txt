       S&amp;amp;amp;P places some Fannie, Freddie ratings on watch -  Friday July 25, 5:18 pm ET S&amp;amp;amp;P places some Fannie, Freddie ratings on watch, affirms the pair&amp;#039;s senior ratings  http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080725/fannie_freddie_ratings.html?.v=2   From the article: &amp;amp;quot;... Fannie and Freddie hold or back $5.3 trillion of mortgage debt, about half the outstanding mortgages in the United States....&amp;amp;quot; .  If you assume that the average mortgage is held for seven years, the bulk of this debt is seven years or newer.        There are still a lot of homeowners underwater with their loans even if they made a 20% down payment (or refinanced a loan with a 80:20 loan-to-value ratio).  From the chart above, if prices fall back to 2001 levels, as much as 50% of the $5.3 Trillion ($2.65 trillion) debt could be underwater.  With a Federal bail out, how many of these home owners in this position plan to walk?  HELOC loans during the peak years (2005-2007) only compound the problem.  These borrowers do not have any workout options and the lender must absorb the entire loss!  I think this event gets resolved with a final bailout by the Fed in 18 months (when the temporary Housing Bill expires). http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/washington/26cnd-housing.html?ref=us   As a result, the $US dollar will probably devalue over the next 18 months.  If there is an announcement that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are to be Nationalized, the $US dollar will probable fall significantly.  I figure that such an event could add an additional $1 Trillion to our national debt (about 1/2 the size of the Iraq war).  The $US dollar could be 20% lower from the current levels.   The value proposition IMO is to own foreign denominated bonds or savings accounts (in the local foreign currency) in a politically stable country that maintain a trade surplus and/or conservative monetary policy.  Such countries might include Australia (large multi year surpluses) or Switzerland (know for their very conservative monetary policy and stable currency). The chart below tracks both the Australian dollar (FXA) and the Swiss Frank (FXF) against the $US dollar over the last five years.  Both currencies shows steady gains against a falling $US dollar.  http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=FXA#chart2:symbol=fxa;range=5y;compare=fxf;indicator=volume;chart...   Setting up a non-us retail term account through  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia  is one way to protect a percentage of your assets from a declining $US dollar.  The relative interest rate yields after the 10% foreign tax is not too bad too. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia is one of the leading financial institutions with businesses in New Zealand, Asia and the United Kingdom. Here are what the current rates look like for the different terms.   http://www.commbank.com.au/personal/rates-fees/term-deposit-rates.aspx   I suppose a portfolio of ADR&amp;#039;s and/or global (multinational) equities might accomplish the same result, but the key is to maintain your purchasing power.  Am I over reacting or could this be a potential &amp;amp;quot;Black Swan&amp;amp;quot; event about to unravel over the next 18 months?  EKS
