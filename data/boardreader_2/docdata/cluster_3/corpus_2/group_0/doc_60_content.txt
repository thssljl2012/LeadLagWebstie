         &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m just wondering at what point depositors start to panic? In all honesty, I&amp;#039;m surprised it hasn&amp;#039;t happened already given the recency of the Northern Rock episode. &amp;amp;quot;  The Dail Mail is doing its best.  EXCLUSIVE: DAILY MAIL DISCOVERS EXISTENCE OF SUB-UNDERWRITERS IN B&amp;amp;B SCANDAL  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1033515/Banks-ride-r...   The Mail writes: &amp;amp;quot;Britain&amp;amp;#8217;s Big Six banks staged a dramatic rescue of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley last night in a bid to avert a new Northern Rock crisis.&amp;amp;quot;  The FT responds: &amp;amp;quot;No they didn&amp;amp;#8217;t. There was no fresh drama last night. No re-re-re-refinancing of the bank formerly known as Bungle.  The banks named as having come to the rescue - HBOS, Abbey, Barclays, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC - are amongst the underwriters and subunderwriters, corralled by the FSA last week when buyout group TPG chickened out of the last B&amp;amp;B rescue plan.  What actually seems to have happened here is that Mail news editors have decided to lean on their quivering business reporters to turn B&amp;amp;B into a high street spectacle, complete with queues of nervous depositors anxious to withdraw their funds.  You couldn&amp;amp;#8217;t make it up.&amp;amp;quot;   http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/07/09/14398/exclusive-d...   S
