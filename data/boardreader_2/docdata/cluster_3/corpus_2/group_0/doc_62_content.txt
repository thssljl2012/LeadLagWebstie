         Meat on the B&amp;amp;B bail-out bones:   The six banks are Abbey, owned by Santander of Spain, Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HBOS, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland. With the exception of Abbey, they had already been persuaded to take part in the rights issue but have now agreed to increase their involvement in the fundraising after negotiations which took place in the run-up to the decision by TPG to walk away.   No vested interests there then :)  It&amp;#039;s like cap-sizing and being picked up by the Titanic  When the mugs took up the XXBillion Rights Issues on the fallen giants of RBS and HBOS  were they aware their money would be spent like this? Unbelievable.
