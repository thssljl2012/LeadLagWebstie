Chief executive John Stewart and most of his senior team faced a hostile, hour-long conference call with analysts, as well as an irate debt investor who attacked the bank over its alleged failure to keep the market fully informed ahead of Thursday&amp;#039;s $800 million bond issue.     Mr Stewart later said he was not surprised by the ferocity of the reaction, which saw NAB shed $7billion in value as its shares slumped $4.14, or 13.5 per cent, to $26.56 -- the bank&amp;#039;s biggest one-day fall since the 1987 market crash.     &amp;quot;At the end of the day, we lost $830 million; people have a right to be upset,&amp;quot; the NAB chief told The Weekend Australian.     The figure actually tops $1billion as it comes on top of an earlier $181 million provision it had set aside.     Mr Stewart effectively ruled out NAB playing a role in the current round of merger and acquisition discussions, saying he had been wrong to think in March that the Bear Stearns bailout had signalled the low-point of the credit crunch.     British newspapers carried a report overnight suggesting that JPMorgan, the investment bank that bought Bear Stearns, had talked to NAB about forming a consortium to break up HBOS, Britain&amp;#039;s biggest mortgage lender.     But the NAB chief said the worst was yet to come, as markets deteriorated and global economies slowed, amid a halving in domestic credit growth over the past six months.     &amp;quot;We now know we&amp;#039;re not at the bottom; I&amp;#039;m not sure this is a clever time to make acquisitions,&amp;quot; Mr Stewart said.     NAB&amp;#039;s stock rout was followed by other lenders, with Commonwealth Bank sagging $3.14, or 6.8 per cent, to $43.25, and ANZ giving up $1.70, or 8.7 per cent, to $17.75. The total loss in value for the Big Four, with Westpac also losing 71c to $22.09, was a staggering $16.2 billion.     St George Bank, Westpac&amp;#039;s merger partner, rounded out the losses, falling $1.04 to $28.61.     The NAB provision related to a $1.2 billion portfolio of collateralised debt obligations, or securities backed by US sub-prime mortgages held in conduit facilities that were established to help finance the bank&amp;#039;s customers.     NabCapital head John Hooper said vacant homes in the US were now at a record level of 10.6 million, which was depressing prices and leading to mortgagee sales where less than half the bank loan was recovered.     Losses of up to 50 per cent of a mortgage&amp;#039;s balance, he said, were &amp;quot;miles outside any loss expectations&amp;quot; in a mature economy.     Despite current losses averaging only 2 per cent of the total portfolio, the expectation was that the situation would deteriorate, making it prudent to provide for a worst-case scenario.     This called for write-downs covering almost 90 per cent of the portfolio, including the previous $181 million charge in the March half-year result.     Respected JPMorgan bank analyst Brian Johnson launched a savage attack on management in the conference call, saying NAB was continuing its &amp;quot;tradition&amp;quot; of disasters after providing reassurance to investors that the bank had been fixed.     A debt investor also took the bank to task over its $800 million bond issue, saying it should follow a European precedent and pay a higher coupon.     NAB chief financial officer Mark Joiner said the market set the coupon, to which the investor responded: &amp;quot;Yes, but fully informed.&amp;quot;     In a later media call, Mr Joiner said the bank&amp;#039;s treasuries &amp;quot;constantly&amp;quot; interacted with the marketplace and said decisions like the provision &amp;quot;take time to reach maturity&amp;quot;. He said: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t think we could conduct ourselves in any other way.&amp;quot;     Mr Stewart said the bank would probably have made the same decisions in similar circumstances, because the CDOs were AAA-rated.     &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s very hard to say that buying AAA assets with a tiny chance of default is reckless; it&amp;#039;s actually not,&amp;quot; he said.
