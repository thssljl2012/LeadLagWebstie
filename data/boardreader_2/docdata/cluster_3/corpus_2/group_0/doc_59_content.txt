         The Banks Want Your Cash By Padraig O&amp;#039;Hannelly   19 July 2008   A different way of solving the cash problem is to be bought out by a larger stronger bank. This is what Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester (LSE: AL) announced this week, selling out to the Spanish bank Santander, which already owns Abbey.  The fate of Lloyds TSB (LSE: LLOY) is the subject of much speculation. If additional funding is required, the most straightforward route may be a buy-out similar to Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester&amp;#039;s.   http://www.fool.co.uk/news/investing/company-comment/2008/07...
