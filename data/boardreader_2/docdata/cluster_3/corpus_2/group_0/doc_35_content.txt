The fact is that the  Halifax  side of the business is going to turn into a bad egg. Quite a few of the banking mergers have a specific mortgage arm that has risked everything to gain market share. These chickens will come to roost over the next 18 months just watch this space.                         I am still not sure what this has to do with the Nationwide.     According to the council of mortgage lenders this was the  top 10 BTL  mortgage providers at the end of 2007 (by balance outstanding - my ownership in brackets)        Birmingham Midshires (part of Halifax, ie HBOS)  Mortgage Express (Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley)  Paragon Group   Bristol &amp;amp;amp; West Group (bank of Ireland)  Cheltenham &amp;amp;amp; Gloucester (Lloyds TSB)  Northern Rock (The good old taxpayer)  Capital Home Loans (Irish Life &amp;amp;amp; Permenant)  Mortgage Works (Nationwide)  Mortgage Business (HBOS)  Barclays - Woolwich     and these were the  top 10 overall mortage providers  (end 2006 I&amp;#039;m afraid).     HBOS  Abbey   Lloyds TSB  Nationwide BS2  Northern Rock  The Royal Bank of Scotland   Barclays   HSBC Bank   Alliance &amp;amp;amp; Leicester  Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley     So if Nationwide are the 4 biggest morgage provider yet only the 8th biggest provider BTL provider  AND  they have a much small percentage of their lending classed as &amp;amp;quot;commercial&amp;amp;quot; (because they are a building society)  AND  more of their funds come from depositers rather than wholesale finance  AND  they had a small reduction in market share during this time period, how then are they in the &amp;amp;quot;deep do do&amp;amp;quot;?     Just wondering.
