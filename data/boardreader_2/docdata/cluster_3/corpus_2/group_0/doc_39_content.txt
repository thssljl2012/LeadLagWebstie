Speaking of banks, I just got a rights offer to  purchase more of my last bank holding, Barclays  (BCS). Kind of like being offered reduced price  shares in a &amp;amp;quot;slightly iceberg damaged&amp;amp;quot; Titanic. My  response was to sell my shares, so now I have no bank  exposure at all. I&amp;#039;ll be back when I think it&amp;#039;s  safe.
