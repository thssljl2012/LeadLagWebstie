 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              iShares (Barclays) splitting ETFs, trying to attract liquidity?   I noticed that many iShares are splitting.&amp;amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s a coincidence that companies tend to split shares near the peaks of popular interest.&amp;amp;nbsp; It usually has the short term impact of creating more liquidity (more affordable 100 share lots) and attracting more sheople because of the more &amp;quot;affordable&amp;quot; prices.  Find me something in this list that isn&amp;#039;t bubbly  SLV (silver trust) 10:1 ILF (Latin America) 5:1 FXI (China) 3:1 EEM (emerging markets) 3:1  In Canada, we have some pretty dramatic splits too XIU and XIC (the TSX index) 4:1 XEG (energy sector) 4:1 XGD (gold sector) 4:1
