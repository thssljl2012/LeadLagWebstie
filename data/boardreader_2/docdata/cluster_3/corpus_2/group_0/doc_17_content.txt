         &amp;amp;quot; LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays  said on Friday that qualifying shareholders took 19 percent of new shares made available in an open offer and that the rest would be taken up by &amp;amp;quot;anchor&amp;amp;quot; investors, as previously agreed.  Barclays said last month that it had raised 4.5 billion pounds ($9 billion) from &amp;amp;quot;anchor&amp;amp;quot; investors in Qatar, Japan and elsewhere, and that it would give existing shareholders the chance to buy on the same terms. &amp;amp;quot;    Barc got their money, but the OO imv was a semi-flop imv.  awbMaven
