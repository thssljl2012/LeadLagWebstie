      Shares in Barclays below the price at which large investors have agreed to invest 4.5bn in the British bank on July 1, further highlighting the difficulties facing banks as they attempt to raise fresh capital .  Barclays shares fell 10p, or more than 3 per cent, to close at 281p, just below the 282p price at which investors, led by the Qatar Investment Authority, have agreed to inject new equity into the bank. If the share price does not recover in the next few weeks, the chance that Barclays existing shareholders will take up their rights to participate in the offering will be reduced. The fall in Barclays share price was part of a broader sell-off in the financial markets, which led to further falls in financial stocks across Europe. Shares in HBOS, the rival UK bank that is in the middle of raising 4bn through a rights issue, dropped 7p to 269p, once again falling below the 275p price at which the issue has been underwritten.  When it unveiled its share offering last week, Barclays stressed the attractions of its approach, which placed shares at a relatively small discount with prospective long-term investors, and gave existing shareholders the opportunity to participate on the same terms.   If shareholders do not take up their rights, Qatari investors will own almost 10 per cent of the banks expanded share capital. Barclays executives believe that the share offering is superior to a deeply discounted rights issue, which risks leaving shares in the hands of underwriters who do not want to own them in the long term. Barclays share offering, which does not require shareholder approval, is expected to be completed in the next few weeks.  However, if the share price falls further it could prove  embarrassing  for Barclays new investors.
