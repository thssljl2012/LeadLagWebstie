        QUOTE (ruisort7 &amp;amp;#064; Jul 4 2008, 07&amp;amp;#58;07 AM)       &amp;amp;quot;St George Bank has lifted its standard variable home loan rate by 0.20% to 9.67%.  Australia&amp;#039;s fifth largest bank attributed the rise to the continuing high cost of funds it sources itself.  The 0.20 per cent rate rise equates to an increase in a home loan payment of about &amp;amp;#036;10 per week on an average sized loan of &amp;amp;#036;250,000 over 30 years.&amp;amp;quot;     I don&amp;#039;t think it will be long now until the average SVR in Oz is over 10% - people then might start to twig that the new paradigm of permanently low interest rates didn&amp;#039;t turn out to be very permanent - perhaps about as permanent oas the permanently high plateau  for house prices
