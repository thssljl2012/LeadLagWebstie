House prices mean-revert to about 4 times average earnings (see chart) but will probably return to 3 times earnings first. In normal economic cycles, prices move between 3 and 5 times earnings, but the huge speculative and leveraged frenzy which has been the BTL bubble has caused them to move up to 7 times. The unwind of this, which will be very painful will likely take prices down to 3 times earnings over the next 5-6 years (with the bulk of the falls happening in the first 3 years). With the inflation mandate of the Bank of England, we can only realistically expect to get 4.5% p.a. earnings growth at best, so 30% is the smallest nominal fall in prices we are going to get nationally (twice the 1989-1994 move).       The big driver of irrational behaviour by BTL speculators, and therefore house price rises, on a nationwide level until last year was ever-improving credit conditions. In London, there was the additional driver of growth (both in terms of employee income and numbers employed) of the financial services sector, but both these factors have not only stopped, but gone into reverse. London is going to fall much more. Sell now  it will be 20 years at least before your house is worth the same price it is now (remembering that it took until 1999 for UK House prices to return to their 1989 level)         Its funny how the schoolboy errors are wrapped in words like logic and sense!      You need to think about this again. Ask yourself a question: These people who arent buying and have to live somewhere - what are they doing right now?      Yes  thats right!.... They are already renting! So, no upward pressure on rentals then....                         This is what I mean by a senior doom and gloomist, I will post a chart supplied to me by Barclays Commercial that lists world events throughout history that have caused economic boom and bust periods.      The bust of the 80&amp;#039;s was caused predominantly but not solely by our Governments sole control of BOE Base rate and of course that in the 1980s economic growth was too fast and unsustainable therefore inflation increased, to reduce it the govt deflated the economy. It seems coincidental that in  the late 90&amp;#039;s (the period at which we entered a cycle of growth) the BOE regained control from the Government of Base Rate and we have seen steady growth ever since.      It is this control that will keep the economy on a more even keel these days that and of course the Banks control over the main and biggest dictating force of house price growth, The First Time Buyer.
