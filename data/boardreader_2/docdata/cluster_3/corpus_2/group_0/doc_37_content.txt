The Treasury will issue a statement on Sunday  expressing support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a  source familiar with the matter said. Treasury  declined to  comment.        &amp;amp;quot;The government cannot afford to let this thing  spiral down too much -- they are part of the  resolution of the housing crisis,&amp;amp;quot; Allegiant&amp;#039;s  Harding  said.        &amp;amp;quot;We buy this kind of paper all the time for our  money markets and there is nothing to stop us from  buying in the future. We are looking at tomorrow&amp;#039;s  Freddie offering,&amp;amp;quot; said Harding, who is based in  Cleveland,  Ohio.        Rajiv Setia, director of U.S. fixed-income strategy  at Barclays Capital, said: &amp;amp;quot;The auction on Monday I  don&amp;#039;t think will be a big issue ... But over time, if  the equity continues to trade in the single digits,  people across the world will begin to ask questions&amp;amp;quot;  about the companies&amp;#039;  stability.        Last Monday, Freddie Mac sold $4 billion of three-  and six-month bills. The $2 billion of three-month  bills were priced at 99.4193 with a money market  yield of 2.337 percent, while the $2 billion of  six-month bills were priced at 98.7486, with a money  market yield of 2.521  percent.        Alex Roever, a strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said in  a client note that investors who have ramped up  purchases of GSE short-term debt this year have grown  &amp;amp;quot;apprehensive, and are unsure of what steps to take  next.&amp;amp;quot; He saw no reason to duck short-term agency  debt,  however.        Roever said if market perceptions of the GSEs&amp;#039;  balance sheets continue to weaken, he sees some form  of government intervention.
