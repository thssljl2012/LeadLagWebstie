 LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch&amp;#039;s surprise write-down ratchets up pressure on rivals to cut the values of their own subprime assets as they grapple with mounting debts and economies weaken.  The global credit crisis, roughly a year under way, could cause total damage of around $1 trillion to balance sheets of financial services companies. That&amp;#039;s far above the more than $400 billion of write-downs taken so far.  Merrill&amp;#039;s revelation of a $5.7 billion (2.8 billion pounds) write-down and plans to sell $8.5 billion of stock heightened worry of more pain to come from European lenders UBS AG and Barclays, and from Wall Street and U.S. commercial banks.  Citigroup, Bank of America Corp, Lehman Brothers Holdings and Wachovia, for example, each still have billions of dollars of exposure to complex debt, mortgages, or both.  .....  According to Oppenheimer &amp;amp; Co analyst Meredith Whitney, Lehman ended May with about $600 million of gross ABS CDO exposure, and $29.4 billion of commercial mortgage exposure. Lehman spokesman Randy Whitestone declined to comment.   http://uk.reuters.com/article/stocksAndSharesNews/idUKA...
