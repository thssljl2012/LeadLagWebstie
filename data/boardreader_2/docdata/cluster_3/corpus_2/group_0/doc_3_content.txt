 The Big Six Banks of HBOS, Abbey, Barclays, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC have agreed to purchase a large chunk of Bradford and Bingley after their shareprice has collapsed to just 34p.    http://ukpress.google.com/article/AL...1lmqJK1Mx-MSdg            Quote:                         Big banks &amp;#039;in B&amp;amp;amp;B bailout bid&amp;#039;   16 hours ago      Britain&amp;#039;s high street banks have agreed to buy a large chunk of shares to rescue troubled Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley, it has been reported.      The buy-to-let lender&amp;#039;s share price dropped to 34p on Tuesday, down from a high of 539p in March 2006, prompting fears the stock is now worthless.      The bank wanted to raise 400 million in a rights issue, selling shares to shareholders at 55p. But the heavy losses may leave the underwriters forced to buy the shares.      The Daily Mail reports that the six high street banks, HBOS, Abbey, Barclays, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, stepped in after being leaned on by the Financial Services Authority.      They have promised to buy the shares which Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley&amp;#039;s main underwriters, the American investment banks UBS and Citigroup, do not buy, a procedure known as &amp;amp;quot;sub-underwriting&amp;amp;quot;. The &amp;amp;quot;Big Six&amp;amp;quot; banks could end up owning at least 30% of their rival.      Analysts do not believe the bank is heading for a Northern Rock-style crisis. Savers would in any event have the first 35,000 of deposits protected by the Government.      B&amp;amp;amp;B has been hit hard by the mortgage troubles caused by the credit crunch and the subsequent housing market woes.      It has reported mounting arrears within its buy-to-let borrowing base as many property owners struggle with repayments.      One City firm cut its target price for the bank to &amp;amp;quot;zero&amp;amp;quot; on Tuesday in the wake of its credit rating downgrade last week by Moody&amp;#039;s and the decision of private equity firm TPG to withdraw its 179 million investment.      A spokesman for Lloyds TSB said: &amp;amp;quot;We were one of the sub-underwriters for the original deal, that remains the case as part of the restructured deal.&amp;amp;quot;                      Bad stuff for a building society which imo should have never demutualised although they should hopefully not fold just why couldn&amp;#039;t they have been more competent? Should be one to keep updated on this thread considering they are such a large employer in West Yorkshire.
