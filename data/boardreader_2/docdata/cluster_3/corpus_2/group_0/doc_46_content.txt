With stocks down sharply and bonds flat  [unless inflation and/ or interet rates rise, then bonds would also drop -- W]  , just about the only thing that is up meaningfully are prices of commodities such as grains, copper and -- as any car owner knows -- oil....  When considering adding commodities to a portfolio, the first thing investors salivating over the past year&amp;#039;s double-digit returns need to remember is that commodities often have exceptionally wide price swings....  ...now could be an especially risky time to put money to work in commodities. After huge rallies, driven at least partly by booming demand for raw materials from China and other fast-developing economies, some argue that prices -- especially on energy -- are due for a fall....  A decision about how much of a portfolio to put in commodities depends, among other things, on whether there are other investments in the portfolio aimed at hedging against inflation, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities or real estate -- which, despite the current market, usually performs well in times of inflation.  &amp;amp;quot;An investor shouldn&amp;#039;t be afraid of a 3% allocation to commodities...and on a more aggressive side, they may want to take that allocation up to 10%...&amp;amp;quot;  ...the results of investing in a mutual fund investing in the stocks of companies in the commodities business, such as oil producers or miners aren&amp;#039;t nearly as meaningful as a direct investment in commodities, because the stocks may rise and fall more in step with the broad stock market than with commodities prices....  Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s GSCI index... energy comprises 78% of the index. An additional 12% is in agriculture products such as wheat, 6% is in industrial metals, such as copper, and the rest is in livestock and precious metals....iShares ETF...  Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index ... there is an annual rebalancing intended to make sure that no group of commodities -- such as energy, which can include natural gas, as well as different crude-oil products -- can make up more than 33% of the index for very long. But over the course of the year, market movements can affect the weightings. Currently, energy is above the cap at 40%, while base metals are at 17% and agriculture at 28%....Tracked by Barclays&amp;#039;s $3.89 billon iPath Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index Total Return ETN...  E-Tracs UBS Bloomberg commodities exchange-traded notes (ETNs) ...considers the level of production and consumption of commodities, in addition to trading volumes. ....  [end quote]  A few weeks ago, I did a fair amount of research on ways to invest in commodities.   This article doesn&amp;#039;t discuss the difference between ETFs and ETNs.   http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etn.asp   http://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/ETNvsETF.asp     An ETN is a type of unsecured, unsubordinated debt security ...ETN returns are based upon the performance of a market index minus applicable fees, no period coupon payments are distributed and no principal protections exists....One factor that affects the ETN&amp;#039;s value is the credit rating of the issuer.  The value of the ETN may drop despite no change in the underlying index, instead due to a downgrade in the issuer&amp;#039;s credit rating ....  ETNs are structured products that are issued as senior debt notes by [the issuing company], while ETFs represent a stake in an underlying commodity.  [end quote]  The i-Shares ETFs (e.g. DBC) invest the money directly into commodity contracts. The investor owns a share of the commodity.  The ETN is an unsecured bond, not a share of commodity. I want no part of that.  Based on that, I stayed with DBC. It&amp;amp;#8217;s the only commodity index ETF I was able to find. The article doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t mention another. If anyone knows about another commodity index ETF, please let me know. Wendy
