         I owe everyone here an apology. It seems that Lloyds IS different after all and their bailout conditions aren&amp;#039;t quite as strict as those of HBOS and RBS.   http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/jeremy-wa...    If it hadn&amp;#039;t been merging with HBOS, Lloyds TSB would have gone the same route as Barclays in attempting to raise the new capital from private investors, and could thereby have had a freer hand with dividend payments. Lloyds TSB thought it was being helpful to the Government in agreeing to be part of the solution for HBOS. Instead it finds itself penalised, unfairly in the view of its investors.  It has already won some concessions. Unlike RBS and HBOS, it is still allowed to pay cash bonuses to executives.    I can just imagine the David Brent (The Office) type speech given to shareholders when approval is sought for this deal:  &amp;amp;quot;The bad news is that you won&amp;#039;t get a dividend because we&amp;#039;re going to be skint for some time after this deal. The good news is that we&amp;#039;ve been very tough on negotiations and the Gubmint have agreed we can pay ourselves cash bonuses so we&amp;#039;re not stuck with the same shite you lot are. And Sir Victor&amp;#039;s got a Lordship. Any questions?&amp;amp;quot;  WShak
