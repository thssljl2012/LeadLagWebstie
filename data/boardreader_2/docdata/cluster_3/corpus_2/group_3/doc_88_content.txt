Investors shares will be worth nothing.     http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/f...ke-in-RBS.html                       7billion that Lloyds might require is nowhere near enough to even justify thinking about a full nationalisation. The businesses are sound, they just need extra capitalisation (which is a pretty commonplace thing in business). So maybe implying that they are in trouble is hardly the best thing to be doing in my opinion, especially when you also state that investors shares will be worth nothing.
