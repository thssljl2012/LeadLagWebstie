         The Telegraph&amp;#039;s view is that both HBOS and RBS will be nationalised  as with Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley and, therefore, the takeover by Lloyds will be off.  However, both Lloyds and Barclays  will also be given taxpayer-funded handouts in return for shares, meaning that none of the major British-owned High Street banks will be fully independent.   They are also suggesting a suspension of trading in UK Bank shares for the  next week    http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcr...   OTOH the same article also states that both Lloyds and HBOS say the deal is still on. My gosh, PR people are still at work on Sunday night!  I await Peston&amp;#039;s decision on the 7 a.m. news
