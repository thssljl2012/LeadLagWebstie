Extract    Update on capital, dividend and current trading     Following the announcement made by the UK Government on 8 October 2008 in relation to UK banking sector capital and funding, Barclays has been in detailed discussions with the UK Financial Services Authority (&amp;#039;FSA&amp;#039;) and HM Treasury.     Capital and dividend  Barclays is well capitalised, profitable and has access to the liquidity required to support its business.  Taking into account the new higher capital targets which the FSA has set for all UK banks, the Board has determined that it will raise in excess of 6.5bn of Tier 1 Capital. This would result in a pro forma Tier 1 Capital ratio as at 30 June 2008 of over 11%.     Given the strength of Barclays well diversified business and the existing capital base, the Board expects that the additional capital will be raised from investors without calling on the Government funding which has been offered to UK Banks. Accordingly, a plan has been agreed with and approved by the FSA which envisages:     The issue of preference shares to raise c3bn by 31 December 2008 as Barclays contribution to the commitment made by UK banks to increase Tier 1 capital by 25 billion in aggregate by year-end.  The issue of new ordinary shares to raise 0.6bn ($1bn) as announced on 17 September as part of our announcement concerning the acquisition of Lehman Brothers North American investment banking and capital markets businesses (&amp;#039;the Lehman Acquisition&amp;#039;).  The issue of new ordinary shares to raise a further c3bn as soon as practicable after the announcement of our full year 2008 results and our intention is that this should be before 31 March 2009. The offer of such shares will be structured so as to give existing shareholders full rights of participation.  Balance sheet management and operational efficiencies to release at least a further 1.5bn in equity resources.     As part of the above issuance of shares, Barclays has agreement in principle with an existing shareholder to contribute 1bn in new capital, to be allocated between the component parts listed above.
