    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              UK set to unveil bailout plans on Monday    banks set to unveil bailout plans  Ralph Gowling and Steve Slater ,  Reuters  Published: Sunday, October 12, 2008  LONDON  -- Major British banks are likely to announce their plans to recapitalise early on Monday, a person familiar with the matter said, a move which could see the government take multi-billion pound stakes in several lenders.    Banks were in crisis talks with the government and regulators on Sunday to determine how much capital each needs from the 50 billion pounds offered by Britain last week.    An announcement is expected before the market opens on Monday but details are still being fine-tuned, said the source, who declined to be identified.

Email to a friend    Printer friendly  Font:****The Sunday Times said Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Barclays could ask for a combined 35 billion-pound lifeline.    RBS may need at least 10 billion pounds, HBOS over 5 billion pounds and Lloyds and Barclays more than 3 billion apiece, according to industry sources and analysts&amp;#039; estimates.    That could result in the government becoming the biggest shareholder -- and even a majority investor -- in RBS and HBOS.    Earlier this year RBS shareholders had said Chief Executive Fred Goodwin he would need to step down if the bank sought to raise more cash.    The government could take seats on the boards of banks, a government source said on Saturday.    Lloyds, RBS, HBOS and Barclays all declined to comment.    Chancellor Alistair Darling, attending a G7 finance ministers&amp;#039; meeting in Washington, said on Saturday the government was to give more details early this week about its already announced 400 billion pound banking rescue plan.    The Sunday Times said the scale of the fund-raising could lead to trading at the London Stock Exchange being suspended to give the market time to digest the impact.    The LSE downplayed that prospect, however. &amp;quot;My information is that the market will open on Monday,&amp;quot; a spokesman said.    RBS, which has seen its market value fall to below 12 billion pounds, is to ask ministers to underwrite a 15 billion pound cash call, the Sunday Times said.    HBOS, Britain&amp;#039;s biggest provider of mortgages, was seeking up to 10 billion pounds, Lloyds wanted 7 billion pounds and Barclays needed 3 billion pounds, the newspaper said.    Barclays, Britain&amp;#039;s second biggest bank, has said it is considering raising capital privately and is expected to try and raise funds from existing shareholders to limit any funds provided by the government.    Lloyds is in the process of buying HBOS and the fundraising could see Lloyds renegotiate the terms of the deal, although both sides were still keen for the merger to go ahead, the Sunday Times said.    Banks were in talks over the weekend with the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England. The scale of the cash required by each will depend on estimates of more losses from their exposure to subprime mortgages and other financial instruments, the source said.    Capital is the cushion a bank keeps to protect its depositors against losses. Many banks ran down their capital in recent years amid a benign economic backdrop, but have been hit by big losses in the last year and now need to recapitalise in the face of an economic recession.
