         AwoodbMayen,  If you are desperate for the capital injection then virtually any percentage is a good deal.  Buffet was ahead of the game and got in the GS were desperate and before the US Government made captial available at 5%.   It therefore has to be questionable whether or not GS would have taken the WB 10% offer if they had known that 5% was around the corner.  Apparently the original Sands/Meddings plan (now being marketed by the politician as the &amp;amp;quot;Brown Plan&amp;amp;quot; was for 10%) but the Government realising that organisations like RBS would have no choice decided to up this to 12% and it is this that lead the former RBS CEO to call the plan &amp;amp;quot;more of a drive by shooting than a rescue plan&amp;amp;quot;.  The issue is therefore how desperately one needs the Government to make a capital injection.  If like RBS you are desperate and 12% from the loan sharks is the only game in town then it is the loan shark or nothing, but if you are not desperate you can look for a better deal then the loan shark is the worst deal in town.  In the case of LloydsTSB, if the merger does not go ahead, they will be able to easily raise the capital they need in the market, but if the deal does go ahead then the loan sharks are the only deal in town.  For me it is quite simple LloydsTSB plus HBOS = RBS LloydsTSB without HBOS = Barclays  Just go and compare the share price movement of Barclays and RBS since the announcement of the rescue plan and then decide which profile you would prefer for LloydsTSB.    For me it is a no-brainer, but perhaps I am stupid or I&amp;#039;m missing something.
