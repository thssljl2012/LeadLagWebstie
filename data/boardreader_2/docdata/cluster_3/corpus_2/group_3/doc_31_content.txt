          Capital injection would be at a 50 per cent discount to the share price, implying government ownership of 46 per cent at Barclays, 56 per cent in Lloyds/HBOS and 62 per cent in RBS, according to JPM.   I don&amp;#039;t believe the terms of the pref shares have been determined. The Government said;   The amount to be issued per institution will be finalised following detailed discussions. If the Government is to provide the capital, the issue will carry terms and conditions that appropriately reflect the financial commitment being made by the taxpayer. In reaching agreement on capital investment the Government will need to take into account dividend policies and executive compensation practices and will require a full commitment to support lending to small businesses and home buyers.   IMV the banks are in a stronger negotiating position than HMG. Barclays said on Monday;   &amp;#039;Contrary to press rumours, Barclays has not requested capital from the government and has no reason to do so.&amp;#039;   As the re-capitalisation is apparently at the behest of HMG I would be very surprised if it were at a 50% discount to the present SP.  Lots of things surprise me these days though.
