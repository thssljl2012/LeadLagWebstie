HBOS shares fall on Lloyds deal repricing talk            LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Shares in HBOS, the UK bank that has accepted a bid from rival Lloyds TSB, fell more than 20 percent on Tuesday amid market talk Lloyds could renegotiate the deal.                By 1030 GMT, Lloyds shares were up 3.3 percent at 224.75 pence, giving its bid a value of 186.5 pence under the recommended offer which will see HBOS investors get 0.83 Lloyds shares for every HBOS share they own.         HBOS shares were down 11 percent at 127.2 pence, having earlier fallen as low as 113 pence.             Both banks declined to comment on the talk of a possible renegotiation, but said they were pressing ahead with the acquisition process.
