         Dope,  &amp;amp;quot; First we have Peston telling us all the banks need capital after discussions which turned out to be 100% denied. &amp;amp;quot;    Really:  &amp;#039;On paper, Lloyds TSB, RBS and Barclays don&amp;#039;t have a pressing need for additional capital.  But they have become concerned that they are being weakened significantly by investors&amp;#039; perception that they are short of capital and their balance sheets need to be strengthened.&amp;#039;  http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2008/10...       ie, not really.  awbMaven
