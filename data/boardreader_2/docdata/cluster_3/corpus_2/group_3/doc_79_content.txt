It is not &amp;amp;quot;happening&amp;amp;quot; with the banks because, as already noted in this thread:   Data reveal short sellers not to blame for UK bank falls   Short sellers could not have been to blame for the share price falls in UK banks, according to data just published, as consultants warn the shorting freeze imposed by the Financial Services Authority has damaged market confidence. ... The levels of stock borrowing of other UK banks was also in single digits. At Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley, it was 6.8% of the shares available to be lent; at Alliance &amp;amp;amp; Leicester, it was 6.8%; Standard Chartered, 2.3%; Lloyds TSB, 3.1%; Barclays, 4.5%; HSBC, 2.8%; and at RBS, 1.2%.   see:  www.wealth-bulletin.com/archive/tag/HBOS/content/2451947961   It is a myth that shorters cripple companies, the real culprits are incompetent management teams.
