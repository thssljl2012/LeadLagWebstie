 There was a very good post on the Stock Market Watch which might explain the pivotal question:     Cui Bono? Is this a random selection of companies, or ...     Behind the Panic: Financial Warfare and the Future of Global Bank Power  by F. William Engdahl  (...)  There is serious ground to believe that US Goldman Sachs ex CEO  Henry Paulson , as Treasury Secretary,  is not stupid . There is also serious ground to believe that he is actually moving according to a  well-thought-out long-term strategy.  Events as they are now unfolding in the EU tend to confirm that. As one senior European banker put it to me in private discussion, &amp;amp;#8216; There is an all-out war going on between the United States and the EU to define the future face of European banking. &amp;amp;#8217;  (...)   Using panic to centralize power   As I document in my forthcoming book,  Power of Money: The Rise and Decline of the American Century ,  in every major US financial panic  since at least the Panic of 1835, the titans of Wall Street&amp;amp;#8212;most especially until 1929, the House of  JP Morgan&amp;amp;#8212;have deliberately triggered bank panics behind the scenes in order to consolidate their grip on US banking.  The private banks used the panics to control Washington policy including the exact definition of the private ownership of the new Federal Reserve in 1913, and to consolidate their control over industry such as US Steel, Caterpillar, Westinghouse and the like. They are, in short, old hands at such financial warfare to increase their power.  It&amp;amp;#8217;s becoming increasingly obvious that people like Henry Paulson, who by the way was one of the most aggressive practitioners of the ABS revolution on Wall Street before becoming Treasury Secretary, are operating on motives beyond their over-proportional sense of greed. Paulson&amp;amp;#8217;s own background is interesting in that context. Back in the early 1970&amp;amp;#8217;s  Paulson started his career working for a rather notorious man named John Erlichman , Nixon&amp;amp;#8217;s ruthless adviser who created the Plumbers&amp;amp;#8217; Unit during the Watergate era to silence opponents of the President, and was left by Nixon to &amp;amp;#8216;twist in the wind&amp;amp;#8217; for it in prison.   Paulson seems to have learned from his White House mentor. As co-chairman of Goldman Sachs according to a New York Times account,  in 1998 he forced out his co-chairman, Jon Corzine &amp;amp;#8216;in what amounted to a coup&amp;amp;#8217;  according to the Times.   Paulson, and his friends at Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase , had a strategy it is becoming clear, as did the Godfather of Asset Backed Securitization and deregulated banking, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, as I have detailed in my earlier series here, Financial Tsunami, Parts I-V.  Knowing that at a certain juncture the pyramid of trillions of dollars of dubious sub-prime and other high risk home mortgage-based securities would come falling down, they apparently determined to spread the so-called &amp;amp;#8216;toxic waste&amp;amp;#8217; ABS securities as globally as possible, in order to seduce the big global banks of the world, most especially of the EU, into their honey trap.  (... and much more worth reading ...)   http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/article_28467.sht...      Let&amp;#039;s go back to the Chart of Failures. The mortgage giants like Fannie &amp;amp; Frannie, Bradford, and Hypo Real Estate are not direct competitors of J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, however Lehman Brothers, AIG (Bear Stearns / XL Insurance), Merrill Lynch, HBOS, WaMu, Fortis and Wachovia were and they have now been eliminated or nationalized in order to be cut up in little pieces later on. Overall this scenario of J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup as behind the scene players (they are all survivors) is much more important than the importance of Legatus who acted much more as a bunch of scavengers, just like Tyco wasn&amp;#039;t that important either compared Enron, et al.
