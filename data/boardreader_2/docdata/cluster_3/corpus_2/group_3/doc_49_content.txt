   Brits get fleeced too         Up to 50bn of taxpayers&amp;#039; cash is to be injected into four of Britain&amp;#039;s biggest banks through the government&amp;#039;s rescue package, the BBC has learned.         Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Barclays is to sell off shares, the majority of which the government is expected to buy.         If the government ends up owning more than half of RBS and HBOS, it will be an effective nationalisation.         More details of the deals are expected to be announced later.          http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7665823.stm          per capita it&amp;#039;s got to be more than the US  _________________ In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.  - George Orwell
