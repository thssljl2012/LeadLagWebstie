    Global markets dive after Lehman declares bankruptcy          http://business.timesonline.co.uk/to...cle4755498.ece       Global stock markets plunged this morning after it emerged that Lehman Brothers, the 158-year old bank, had filed for bankruptcy after the failure of a weekend of rescue talks masterminded by US Government.      The Bank of England moved to calm UK markets today by pumping 5 billion into the short-term money markets, to guard against fears that financial markets will grind to a halt if banks, spooked by the collapse of Lehman, stop lending to each other.      Earlier this morning, the Bank said it was &amp;amp;quot;monitoring carefully conditions in sterling money markets and will take appropriate actions if necessary to stabilise those markets&amp;amp;quot;.      In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading blue chip companies fell by 184.1 points to 5,232.6 in morning trade, reversing gains made at the end of last week when a chance to secure Lehman&amp;#039;s future remained.      In France, the CAC 40 index lost 181.86 points to 4150.8 and Frankfurts DAX fell 1.55 per cent to 6,138.42 points.      Bank shares were predictably badly hit in early trading. Morgan Stanley was down almost 10 per cent in Frankfurt, while reports that the world&amp;#039;s biggest insurer, American International Group (AIG), was seeking rescue funding meant that its shares lost a third of their value on the German market.      In contrast, Merrill Lynch shares were up 38 per cent after it struck a $44 billion (24.4 billion) deal to sell the group to Bank of America.      The deal came as a surprise to markets since Bank of America was believed to be in talks with Lehman about a deal. Barclays was also in discussions about buying Lehman but said today it walked away because it was not possible to conclude a transaction in the best interests of Barclays&amp;#039; shareholders&amp;amp;quot;.      While the Merrill deal is expected to be widely perceived as a positive move, the collapse of Lehman, which controls $600 billion worth of assets, has sent shock waves through the London and New York stock and debt markets.      It is widely expected that the Dow Jones industrial average will open 300 points lower when trading begins.      Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; UK operations were put into administration this morning, with PricewaterhouseCoopers appointed to oversee the administration.      Tony Lomas, one of the administrators and a partner at PwC, said that the business would be wound down in as orderly manner as possible.       &amp;amp;quot;Because the group managed its funding on a global basis, the UK trading operation found itself unable to meet its obligations when the flow of funds dried up last night, &amp;amp;quot; Mr Lomas said.      &amp;amp;quot;Our priority now is to work with management and trading counterparties to agree the manner in which the assets and liabilities will be handled.&amp;amp;quot;      He added: I would also like to emphasise that a number of group companies remain solvent and will continue to trade. These companies include Lehman Brothers Asset Management Europe and a series of special purpose vehicles designed to manage portfolios of residential and commercial real estate assets and non-performing loans.      Lehman Brothers said today that its customers would be able to continue to use their accounts normally and it will take a series of actions today that will should allow it to continue managing its operations, including paying staff wages.      Lehman Brothers said: &amp;amp;quot;The board of directors ... authorised the filing of the Chapter 11 petition in order to protect its assets and maximise value&amp;amp;quot;.      The Financial Services Authority (FSA), the City watchdog, said today: &amp;amp;quot;The FSA is working with market practitioners, including the London Clearing House (LCH), to ensure the process connected with the winding down of this wholesale business is completed in an orderly manner to minimise any market disruption.&amp;amp;quot;      More than 26,000 jobs are at risk across Lehmans global operations. Earlier this year, the bank, which has written down billions of dollars on toxic assets linked to the US mortgage market, said it would cut 5 per cent of its workforce.      Workers at Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; Canary Wharf headquarters were &amp;amp;quot;numb&amp;amp;quot;, according to employees.      A source at the bank said today: &amp;amp;quot;People are just trying to absorb what happened and get as much information as they can, but there&amp;#039;s been no big official meetings. There have been talks division by division.&amp;amp;quot;      The source said that staff were told to come in to work today as normal and were &amp;amp;quot;trying to be professional, cancelling appointments&amp;amp;quot; but have been warned not to enter into any trades without sign-off from their superiors.      The hunt is now on for which banks are exposed to Lehman and, at the weekend, traders at all the leading banks were ordered back to their desks to calculate their exposure to a possible collapse of the lender.      While the bank has widely been perceived as most vulnerable because of its substantial holdings of mortgage-backed securities, it was the US Treasury&amp;#039;s refusal to bankroll a rescue that was seen as preventing other parties from bailing out the bank.       US authorities had tried to secure a rescue deal for Lehman Brothers over the weekend.      Mr Paulson and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, had convened an emergency meeting in New York on Friday evening to try to convince other banks to rescu Lehman.      At the same time, the Merrill Lynch board, led by John Thain, agreed to be bought by Bank of America, the mortgage provider, for around $29 a share, well above the $17.05 that Merrill Lynch stock closed at on Friday evening but below the $97 they fetched in January 2007. It is understood that both boards have approved the all-share deal.      The deal will mean that Merrill Lynch, which has been dogged by questions over its mortgage-backed securities, is protected by Bank of America&amp;#039;s substantial current account, credit card and lending businesses.      American authorities had hoped to ring-fence $85 billion worth of Lehman&amp;#039;s real estate assets into one company, which they wanted banks, such as Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase, to prop up with $35 billion of new capital.      Mr Paulson had hoped to persuade the banks to inject new money to prevent a fire sale of Lehman&amp;#039;s assets, a move which could have triggered a fall in the value of their own securities.      At the same time, Mr Paulson had tried to sell Lehman&amp;#039;s investment bank to either Bank of America or Barclays. However, both walked away at the weekend after Mr Paulson refused to bankroll a possible bailout of Lehman with taxpayers&amp;#039; funds.      On Sunday evening, Lehman Brothers, whose shares have fallen about 94 per cent over the year, was left in a vulnerable position.      Over the weekend, the bank hired bankruptcy specialists in the event that all other funding routes failed.      The collapse of Lehman and purchase of Merrill is likely to worsen an already difficult financial sector job market.      Headhunters said today that the US had already seen 100,000 jobs go in finance in the past year and that it was likely to see a further 50,000 cut.      Staff from Bear Stearns, which was bought by JPMorgan Chase in February, are still thought to be looking for work. Recruitment consultants said that they expected resumes to start flooding the market this morning.      The Federal Reserve is expected to try to help banks exposed to Lehman to use a wider range of collateral to borrow funds from the central bank.      In addition, 10 leading banks said they would pool $70 billion of their own money to create a borrowing facility. The 10 institutions, which include Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, could tap the pool to help them ride out the crisis.      At Lehman&amp;#039;s New York headquarters In midtown Manhattan, employees were seen removing their belongings from the building ahead of the bank&amp;#039;s expected collapse.
