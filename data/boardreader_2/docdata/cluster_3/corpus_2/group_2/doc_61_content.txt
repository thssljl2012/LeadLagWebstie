I made this post over at another forum, I think it sums up everything about the most recent events pretty nicely in a non-tldr format:      The Fed  : Has been really hardnosed this weekend, and flatly refused to provide any financial backstop to buyers this time around (you know that JPM bought Bear for $10, what you might not know is that JPM agreed only because the Fed absorbed some $29 billion in losses - most of the toxic assets - so it was a sweetheart deal for JPM). They have suffered enough embarrassment as it is with all the bailouts they have offered recently. But you better believe they will be offering plenty of tacit forbearance to cooperative parties.    Lehman Brothers:   Was looking for a buyer in Barclays, B of A, et al., but they all backed out because the Fed would not cover their losses from toxic assets. So LEH will file Ch. 11 and liquidate most of the company.      Merrill Lynch:   MER has been considered by most to be next on the chopping block for a long time now. This weekend in the late-night meetings, once it was realized that LEH was going to fail, the focus shifted not on saving them, but on preventing a domino-induced collapse of the rest of the financial sector.  In this sentiment, B of A agreed to buy MER for a high price (MER closed Friday at $17, B of A paid $44b or $29 per share). The hot topic today is why they agreed to such a premium.     Stopping the spread of contaminant :   In addition to organizing the purchase of MER, the Fed and the banking industry have started two additional measures to delay a complete collapse. These are   #  The Fed has further opened up it&amp;#039;s emergency lending facilities (discount window), by being open to more toxic collateral.   #  Banks have created an emergency lending pool of money worth $70 billion that is available for the aid of faltering financial companies.    Broker dealers:   All the big independent broker dealers are in trouble now. They are all highly leveraged, highly illiquid,  and susceptible to bank-run types of events.  Bear, LEH, and MER are done.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are left.  In order to survive, most agree that they each need to merge with a big commercial bank - a large base of insured depositors will provide the resources needed to sustain their business.     AIG:   This is an insurance company. Its stock is down 80% in 52 weeks, but before this it was one of the ten largest companies in the world.  It is being threatened with a ratings downgrade, which would cause it to no longer access the lending it is dependent on for its liquidity.  If they are downgraded, they are facing a $46 billion capital call, so they are scrambling to come up with this kind of cash now.  Last night there was word that they had asked the Fed for a  bridge loan of that amount while they liquidate their assets! (This is incredible if you remember that until now, the Fed only dealt with commercial banks, and I-banks since the credit crisis. An insurance company?)    Who&amp;#039;s next?:   The broker dealers must merge with a  commercial bank or they will fail within a year.  Other beleaguered financial  institutions like WaMu, insurance companies, and hedge funds are highly vulnerable and the next in line.        What this means for the average guy:    Well housing prices are sure to keep falling. The easiest way to explain how it could impact you directly is to play out the worst case scenario. If the financial sector and the Fed are unable to work out an orderly de-tangling of counterparty risk (swap derivatives) attached to toxic assets (ABCP, MBS) - which ties all of the banks together and is why if one goes down they all might - we could see:    Housing prices plummet, up to 150 banks fail, pensions funds are wiped out, we enter a recession/depression in 2009,  unemployment skyrockets, consumer spending decreases dramatically.  Our economy could look like japan when they had their crisis- stock market loses 80% of it&amp;#039;s value, and then trades sideways for the next ten years (it has never recovered) .  This won&amp;#039;t happen overnight, but could play out over the course of maybe two years.    ----------------  Now jamming to:  September - Looking for Love (Radio Version)  &amp;amp;nbsp;
