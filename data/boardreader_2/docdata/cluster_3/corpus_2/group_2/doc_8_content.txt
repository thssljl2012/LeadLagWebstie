it gets better....   A.I.G. Seeks $40 Billion in Fed Aid to Survive    http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/20.../index.html?hp     Tomorrow, we could have black monday during the walk-over to XM.    NYPost weighs in       Quote:                          TURMOIL    LEHMAN END NEARS AS BANK FAILS TO FIND SAVIOR    Last updated: 9:17 pm    In one of the biggest financial disasters in US history, Wall Street powerhouse Lehman Brothers is on the brink of going out of business tonight after the feds refused to put taxpayers on the hook for a bailout.    And even as Lehman is sinking, another former financial powerhouse, Merrill Lynch, is vanishing in a rescue merger.    UPDATE: Bank Of America Signs Deal To Buy Merrill Lynch    Lehman is still scrambling to save itself by finding an 11th-hour buyer, but no takers immediately materialized after Barclays Capital and Bank of America pored over its balance sheet and walked away.    The 158-year-old company, based in New York, has more than 24,000 employees around the world - between 10,000 and 12,000 in the city - facing loss of their jobs.    Mayor Bloomberg put off a scheduled trip to San Francisco to try to help deal with the crisis.    After rejecting Lehman, Bank of America, finalized a deal to take over Merrill.    Lehman&amp;#039;s fate appeared to be sealed after the collapse of three days of white-knuckle negotiations involving the investment bank&amp;#039;s president, Richard Fuld, possible buyers, and government authorities, including Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and New York Federal Reserve President Tim Geithner.    Buyers wanted the feds to agree to a deal like the one that convinced JPMorgan Chase to take over another giant investment bank, Bear Stearns, at a fire-sale price.    JPMorgan Chase agreed after the Federal Reserve guaranteed the taxpayers would eat expected losses from Bear Stearns&amp;#039; dodgy real-estate mortgages - up to $29 billion.    But Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke took heat from politicians on Capitol Hill and declined to offer a similar deal to any company willing to take over Lehman.    Bank of America is not looking for a federal guarantee for its takeover of Merrill - an institution in far better financial shape than Lehman.    &amp;amp;quot;What we&amp;#039;re seeing is that the federal government is now trying to draw a line as to how much support they&amp;#039;re willing to give,&amp;amp;quot; said Vincent Rinehart, a former director of the Federal Reserve Board.    Potential Lehman buyers also included foreign firms such as British-based HSBC and several Japanese banks - which also kicked the tires and said no thanks.    They were interested only in the investment bank&amp;#039;s so-called &amp;amp;quot;good&amp;amp;quot; businesses - its securities operation and its asset management unit, anchored by Neuberger Berman.    They wanted no part of its $85 billion worth of toxic commercial and residential mortgages, worth only pennies on the dollar.    Over the weekend, bankers at competing firms spent much of their time reviewing their business with Lehman - paying special attention to certain complex securities they hold guaranteed by the investment bank.    The federal government has been observing Lehman closely since Bear Stearns went out of business in a stunning collapse that saw about half its 14,000 bankers on the street back in March.    Since then, Lehman&amp;#039;s Fuld has been trying desperately to convince the street that his company is in better shape than Bear Stearns, to raise capital, and to restore confidence in its venerable bond-trading business. All of its efforts apparently failed.    The situation for Fuld&amp;#039;s firm reached dire proportions when last week&amp;#039;s talks to raise billions in much-needed cash from the Korean Development Bank failed.    Making matters worse, an early release of Lehman&amp;#039;s third-quarter results revealed nearly $4 billion in losses and an incomplete plan to sell its asset-management arm.    A spokesman for Lehman declined to comment.
