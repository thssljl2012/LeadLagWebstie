Phil Gramm (Tex.), who is now an economic adviser to his campaign. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to make the countrys financial institutions competitive by removing the Depression-era walls between banking, investment and insurance companies.      That bill allowed AIG to participate in the gold rush of a rapidly expanding global banking and investment market. But the legislation also helped pave the way for companies such as AIG and Lehman Brothers to become behemoths laden with bad loans and investments.       In other words, McCain, along with Phil Gramm  you know, the guy who thinks the recession is all mental  passed legislation that is directly responsible for the gargantuan mess we now find ourselves in. Is that the kind of experience we really need in the White House?      And Diaz response? None of that matters. What matters is that McCain talked about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac a few years ago. And what about that Barack Obama guy? Hes hasnt been Washington long enough to screw things up like McCain has!      This is really what it comes down to: A guy with a quarter century of experience passing legislation that ruins the economy versus someone who offers a fundamentally different approach to solving the mess the other guy made. Easy choice if you ask me. Its unfair to say John McCain doesnt understand the economy because he certainly understands how to destroy it.       http://www.crooksandliars.com/                                        Ben Stein, a McCain supporter was just on Larry King. He stated that McCain was getting bad economic advice.    He said the last thing we need is tax breaks for corporations, tax breaks for the wealthy, and no new regulations for banking and investment corporations.   Obama was touting increasing banking regulations a year ago...McCain was against it.                                                                                                                                                                                                            steve burns               View Public Profile                Send a private message to steve burns                      Find all posts by steve burns
