 I have a simple question, well actually two. Ive followed with bewilderment all the news surrounding the banking crisis and then the mortgage crisis and the most recent AIG government buyout but someone explain this to me.              First, every single bank that ever wrote a sub-prime loan always required mortgage insurance. The reason was if the mortgage ever defaulted, the bank would be paid by the mortgage insurance company. The bank even made the loan applicant pay for this insurance. Even if the mortgage defaulted, the bank still got their money. So in other words, the banks did not actually lose any money.             Next, the major mortgage insurance company was AIG, a fact not known by most people. But their insurance was always underwritten or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Fannie Mac. If they had to pay out to a bank, they simply went to the guarantor of the loan (Fannie Mae or Fannie Mac), and they got their money. So in other words, AIG and every single other mortgage insurance company did not actually lose any money.             Next, we now know that Fannie Mae and Fannie Mac were taken over by the government and all loan and mortgage guarantees that were in default were rescued through the use of public funds. We were told this was needed for the good of the country so I wont debate that here. In other words, Fannie Mae and Fannie Mac did not actually lose any money.             Next, Im told by the news of loses of billions of dollars all through the financial industry. Yet nobody lost any money. Isnt that strange?             So my question is: who lost the money and where did the money go?                         Part Two:             Todays news item talked about the need of the infusion of 180 billion dollars into the financial industry in order to protect the economy of the country. I can only assume this is needed to replace the money that was never lost in the first place. You do the math.
