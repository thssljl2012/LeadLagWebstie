  http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/17/mccain-aig/       Yesterday, the federal government offered insurance giant AIG an $85 billion loan to in the biggest government takeover thus far in the ongoing credit crisis. Interviewed on NBCs Today Show before the decision yesterday, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said that we cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else:               Quote:                         No, I do not believe that the American taxpayer should be on the hook for AIG and Im glad that the Secretary Paulson has apparently taken the same line.                     Interviewed on ABC this morning, however, McCain suggested that he supported the bail out:               Quote:                         I didnt want to do that. And I dont think anybody I know wanted to do that. But there are literally millions of people whose retirement, whose investment, whose insurance were at risk here. They were going to have their lives destroyed because of the greed and excess and corruption.                     ABC observed that McCain today sound[ed] somewhat accepting of the Feds action on AIG. Watch it:       [MEDIA]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e1XrsmWUkQ[/MEDIA]
