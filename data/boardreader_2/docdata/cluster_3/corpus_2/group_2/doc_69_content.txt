 Another big financial institution (Lehman Brothers) filing for bankruptcy protection from the Fed and a big insurance company (AIG) trying to get a $40 billion lifeline from the Fed...     At what point do we say &amp;amp;quot;enough is enough&amp;amp;quot; and put a stop to this federal flushing of money into the private sector?  And by &amp;amp;quot;we&amp;amp;quot; I obviously don&amp;#039;t mean you and I because we can do pretty much NOTHING here... the Fed is judge, jury, and executioner when it comes to this.  They decide who lives and who dies.     I know it&amp;#039;s scary... Lehman stocks fell 80% nearly immediately this morning.  I can understand why people start   when that happens, but funneling tax money to keep the failing company alive only exacerbates the situation in the long run.  It supports the poor choices they have made in the past.  It prevents (smaller) successful financial institutions from growing.  Same thing goes for the insurance company.     If we continue to try to save companies like this then eventually that&amp;#039;s all our taxes will go to.  By not allowing that business to be reabsorbed into the industry, the WHOLE industry is worse off... and so is the WHOLE economy.     But what can we (as tax payers, voters, and citizens) do?  I sure as hell don&amp;#039;t know... we never voted for Bernanke.
