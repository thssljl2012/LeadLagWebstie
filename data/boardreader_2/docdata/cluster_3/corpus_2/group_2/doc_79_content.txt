    Andrew Chryse:  Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddy Mac secured, AIG possibly next. See what kind of response  you  receive when you go to your government and say, &amp;quot;Uh, you know what? I&amp;#039;m $172,000 in debt and I&amp;#039;ve no way to pay it off. So you can take care of it.&amp;quot;   AIG is insurance. A lot of innocent policy holders may lose all their money if they go belly-up!
