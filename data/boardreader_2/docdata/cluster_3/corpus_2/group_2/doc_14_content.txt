PROBLEMS!!!                      Listen to this man&amp;#039;s wisdom.       AIG falls and its POSSIBLE (the scenario is likely enough for the Fed to bailout AIG without blinking) that all these investment banks, retail banks, etc that the normal man on the street uses including overseas banks will collapse and as di man seh... PROBLEMS. So now the Fed HAD to act to bail out AIG because its likely the economy would be truly crippled if they let that happen. They have to allow the economy to fall some yes... but this fall has to be cushioned and gentle... not a rug pulled from under everyone even those sensible enough to have not gambled on unstable assets.       If you want someone to blame point the finger at those who believe that self-interest and the &amp;quot;invisible hand&amp;quot; will work without government. It doesn&amp;#039;t work anymore than Communism works with greed.
