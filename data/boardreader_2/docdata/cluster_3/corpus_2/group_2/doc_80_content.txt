    JASON HUN:    The bailouts are all done by the Bush admin (it&amp;#039;s not up for Congressional voting)... The Dems only have 49 votes in Congress  AIG is a private insurance conmpany &amp;amp; the Repubs passed the Gramm-Leachy bill in 1999 that repealed the 1934 Glass-Steagull Act (44 out of 46 Repubs voted for it Gramm&amp;#039;s bill, 39 out of 40 Democrats voted against it --though it was signed by Clinton) that allowed the current mess to take place (a repeat of the 1920&amp;#039;s finacial mess that led to the Great Depression that the 1934 Glass-Steagull Act prevented)    the bush administration would have to get approval from congress like they did for the bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.But i forgot AIG is a internationally known and respected....they had no choice but to bail them out....plus the company would have to go to the federal reserve to ask for a loan to bail them out. But the thing about that the fed. reseve got a high intrest rate. so i think we might get the money back.  but the thing about the bailouts this happened right before the great depression.
