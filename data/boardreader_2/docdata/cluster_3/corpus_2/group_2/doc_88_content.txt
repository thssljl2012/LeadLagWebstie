Well the DOW went down 500 points yesterday.  Coupled with another 500 points down spike earlier this week, that&amp;#039;s a net loss of around 10%.      Not to mention that the Federal reserve is trying to save AIG.  If AIG or another big time insurance company goes bankrupt, then you can expect some serious problems.  I&amp;#039;m not saying we&amp;#039;re in a recession, but the economy isn&amp;#039;t very strong right now.  It&amp;#039;s not looking great for a speedy recovery either.
