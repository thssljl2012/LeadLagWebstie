AIG is one of the largest international insurance holding company&amp;#039;s in the WORLD.       AIG is also one of the largest financial services organiza -tions in the world, with holdings and operations in over 130 countries.       With that being said:       AIG is on the BRINK! of bankruptcy.   I couldn&amp;#039;t even begin to speculate how many banks or financial institutions both domestic and international who have exposure to AIG, so I won&amp;#039;t.      This I do know: AIG is so huge they make Bear Stearns and Lehman brothers look like a couple of back alley loan sharks.      I was listening to some guy on CNN  (I didn&amp;#039;t even bother to remember his name) , he said AIG&amp;#039;s troubles has nothing to do with the economy. That guy needs to be fired.      Nothing could be further from the truth. One of their main functions is to reimburse banks who lost money on bad loans, or because of defaults on loans as it were.      Why does CNN even pay some of these folks. It&amp;#039;s all tied to the economy. Even if AIG gets help from some private equity firms, this economy still has to be straightened out.       It&amp;#039;s also surprising that I never hear the people on CNN talk about anything other than stocks, bonds, commodities, corporations, wall street, the investors and etc. They do mention how sluggish this economy is from time to time, but they never get down to the real nitty gritty, the root of the problem.      --   Edited by ziptop at 09/16/2008 12:30 AM PDT
