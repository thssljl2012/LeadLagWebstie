 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/16/AR2008091603732_pf.html             &amp;amp;quot;A decade ago, Sen. John McCain embraced legislation to broadly deregulate the banking and insurance industries, helping to sweep aside a thicket of rules established over decades in favor of a less restricted financial marketplace that proponents said would result in greater economic growth.        Now, as the Bush administration scrambles to prevent the collapse of the American International Group (AIG), the nation&amp;#039;s largest insurance company, and stabilize a tumultuous Wall Street, the Republican presidential nominee is scrambling to recast himself as a champion of regulation to end &amp;amp;quot;reckless conduct, corruption and unbridled greed&amp;amp;quot; on Wall Street.&amp;amp;quot;        After the fact, Mccain now says he will &amp;amp;quot;reform&amp;amp;quot; and support regulations. These are the same regulations, he helped to void and null. Again and often, do we need four more years of Bush.
