These &amp;amp;quot;companies&amp;amp;quot; are the backbone of our economy, and as such, their failure could cause a huge ripple effect.  Pretty self explanatory.        I guess you&amp;#039;ve never read about the depression?  The S&amp;amp;amp;L collapse?  Do you even know what AIG is?         I&amp;#039;ve read and studied the great depression, I never heard of the S&amp;amp;amp;L collapse.  All I know about AIG is that they&amp;#039;re an insurance company.
