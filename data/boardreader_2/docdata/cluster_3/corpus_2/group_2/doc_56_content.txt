Here is something interesting about that.     JWBPLANATV wrote:     Look at the sstock market and the trouble our economy is in but then I guess you would blame all that on the Democrats. Remember when President Clinton left offfice we had a suplus of 3 trillion dollars now our spender in the oval offfice has us trillion&amp;#039;s of dollars in dept and our stock market is plunging. If you try to blame it on the democrats then I must class you with mccain because neither one of you know your butt from **** in the ground.     In 2002, McCain introduced a bill to deregulate the broadband Internet market, warning that &amp;amp;quot;the potential for government interference with market forces is not limited to federal regulation.&amp;amp;quot; Three years earlier, McCain had joined with other Republicans to push through landmark legislation sponsored by then-Sen. Phil Gramm (Tex.), who is now an economic adviser to his campaign. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to make the country&amp;#039;s financial institutions competitive by removing the Depression-era walls between banking, investment and insurance companies.   That bill allowed AIG to participate in the gold rush of a rapidly expanding global banking and investment market. But the legislation also helped pave the way for companies such as AIG and Lehman Brothers to become behemoths laden with bad loans and investments.   McCain now condemns the executives at those companies for pursuing the ambitions that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made possible, saying that &amp;amp;quot;in an endless quest for easy money, they dreamed up investment schemes that they themselves don&amp;#039;t even understand.&amp;amp;quot;    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26749280/    We have A LOT to thank McCain and his &amp;amp;quot;economic advisor&amp;amp;quot; for getting us into the the mess we are in now. Who in their RIGHT MIND would expect the companies to self-regulate (an oxymoron) themselves?
