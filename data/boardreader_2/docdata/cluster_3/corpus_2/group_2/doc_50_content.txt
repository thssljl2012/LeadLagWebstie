For starters, the FED has violated its own Federal Reserve Act section 23A that sets the limits on how much money can be injected at any single time.   Second of all - AIG was a shareholder operated company. The so-called &amp;quot;rescue&amp;quot; initiative did not get put to a vote. The shareholders that were expecting an announcement got handed the decision: &amp;quot;Your company now belongs to somebody else. Your stock is now worthless.&amp;quot;   AIG is a private insurance company. The FED along with the Treasury are using public funds (taxpayer money along with printed cash) to buy a private organization. They are confiscating property from investors that did not agree to the move, paid by taxpayers that never got to share any of the profits of the company but will now have to foot the bill.   Imagine if I had to use your money, without your consent, to buy and fix somebody else&amp;#039;s car, with neither you, nor the owner of the car being aware of the deal until it was done. That is what government and the Fed are doing.   The purchase of AIG is completely illegal. Conservatorship is the new word for confiscation.   Haven&amp;#039;t you heard the phrase: &amp;quot;Privatizing the gains while socializing the losses?&amp;quot; That describes US today. It is completely illegal.
