No need to worry.....        Bush feels the pain          Earlier Monday, President Bush acknowledged the &amp;amp;quot;pain&amp;amp;quot; of investors and workers in the finance industry, but assured the public that the government is working to iron out the problems.    &amp;amp;quot;I know Americans are concerned about the adjustments that are taking place in our financial markets,&amp;amp;quot; said Bush, speaking in the White House Rose Garden. &amp;amp;quot;We are working to reduce disruptions and minimize the impact on the [broader economy].&amp;amp;quot;    Bush didn&amp;#039;t offer much detail as the Dow plunged more than 200 points and the finance industry suffered one of its worst crises ever, stemming from its investments in the battered real estate sector.     &amp;amp;quot;In the short run, adjustments in the financial markets can be painful, for people worried about their investments, and for employees of the firms,&amp;amp;quot; said Bush.    In addition to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, here are a couple of the   latest developments   in the finance sector:   Merrill:  Bank of America (  BAC  ,   Fortune 500  ) said it would buy Merrill Lynch (  MER  ,   Fortune 500  ) for $50 billion in stock, or $29. Merrill&amp;#039;s stock surged nearly 15%   on the news   to $19.59 a share, while Bank of America plunged 17% to $27.80 a share.      AIG:  The stock plunged 52% to $5.81 a share for AIG (  AIG  ,   Fortune 500  ), after the insurance giant said it was getting ready to announce a restructuring.     Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies &amp;amp;amp; Co., described  this as the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s and the railroad bankruptcies of the 1800s.      &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;ve never witnessed this before,&amp;amp;quot; said Hogan before Bush&amp;#039;s speech. &amp;amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s no road map for this.&amp;amp;quot;
