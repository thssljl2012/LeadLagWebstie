       It seems to me the bailout is upside down.   The fed shouldn&amp;#039;t be bailing out wallstreet firms.   To end the crisis the fed should start by bailing out homeowners with bad mortgages.   Initially the govt would  just ask all the various banks (in the U.S.) with unproductive mortgages to submit a request for a subsidy.  Then the fed would start making payments on the mortgage.  This means the securities aren&amp;#039;t bad, so they banks don&amp;#039;t need a bailout.   This would stop the immediate crisis.    Now of course  you can&amp;#039;t just give everyone money to pay their mortgage , because some were already paying on time or already paid-off their house.  So for each loan the govt subsidises it will add the amount to taxes that individual owes and let the IRS keep track.    In the mean time the fed would readjust some of the mortgages so they are payable,  others it would just create a second loan that the individual must pay, and still others might just have to be forclosed, but none of this has to be done in a crisis mode, it can be done over the next year or two.  It will be a mess, but it can be straightened out over time in a thoughtful way, not a crisis.   This will cost money, but a lot less than 700 billion,  and  what money is spent  will still be in the American economy  and not going to golden parachutes or big payouts to foreign banks.   The banks will take a haircut on the various writedowns, but the closeness of the cut is controllable, and there is no reason for bankrupcy.  FInally, since the loans payback to the banks within reason, there is no need to bailout AIG or other insurance companies since insurance payouts will be resonable too.
