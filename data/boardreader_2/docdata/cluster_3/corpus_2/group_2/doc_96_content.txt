                     Here&amp;#039;s the gist of what I can get:  We&amp;#039;re are in a huge financial crisis, and George Bush gave us that news last night when it was already happening.  Mortgage home companies are in deep trouble, including AIG, one of the big insurance companies, which I have my car insurance under.  McCain is postponing his campaign for the $700 billion bailout economy thing while Obama wants to multitask both situations.
