 83 Wall Street lobbyists on the wall. If one of them should hapen to break ...          Quote:                         McCain has been quick with fiery, populist-tinged speeches. But one thing has been missing: any acknowledgment that McCain&amp;#039;s own campaign has been loaded with the type of people he&amp;#039;s been denouncing. (The McCain campaign did not respond to a request for comment; we will update the post if they do.) As  Mother Jones  previously   reported  , former Senator Phil Gramm, McCain&amp;#039;s onetime campaign chairman, used a backroom maneuver in late 2000 to slip into law a bill that kept credit default swaps unregulated. These financial instruments greased the way to the subprime meltdown that has led to today&amp;#039;s economic crisis. Several of McCain&amp;#039;s most senior campaign aides have   lobbied   for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.      And the Democratic National Committee, using publicly available records, has identified   177 lobbyists   working for the McCain campaign as either aides, policy advisers, or fundraisers.      Of those 177 lobbyists, according to a  Mother Jones  review of Senate and House records, at least 83 have in recent years lobbied for the financial industry McCain now attacks. These are high-paid influence-peddlers who have been working the corridors of the nation&amp;#039;s capital to win favors and special treatment for investment banks, securities firms, hedge funds, accounting outfits, and insurance companies. Their clients have included AIG, the newest symbol of corporate excess; Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy on Monday sending the stock market into a tailspin; Merrill Lynch, which was bought out by Bank of America this week; and Washington Mutual, the banking giant that could be the next to fall.                       http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/...treet_aig.html
