Funny how Obama is on the campaign trail talking about going after greedy, corrupt, nasty CEOs and yet his economic adviser is one.                      Lies, but I bet you know this already.  Franklin Raines has not and never will be an Obama advisor.     The McCain campaign is obtuse, McCain has a much larger connection to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

These financial instruments greased the way to the subprime meltdown that has led to today&amp;#039;s economic crisis. Several of McCain&amp;#039;s most senior campaign aides have  lobbied  for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And the Democratic National Committee, using publicly available records, has identified  177 lobbyists  working for the McCain campaign as either aides, policy advisers, or fundraisers.       Of those 177 lobbyists, according to a  Mother Jones  review of Senate and House records, at least 83 have in recent years lobbied for the financial industry McCain now attacks. These are high-paid influence-peddlers who have been working the corridors of the nation&amp;#039;s capital to win favors and special treatment for investment banks, securities firms, hedge funds, accounting outfits, and insurance companies. Their clients have included AIG, the newest symbol of corporate excess; Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy on Monday sending the stock market into a tailspin; Merrill Lynch, which was bought out by Bank of America this week; and Washington Mutual, the banking giant that could be the next to fall. Among these 83 lobbyists are McCain&amp;#039;s chief political adviser, Charlie Black (JP Morgan, Washington Mutual Bank, Freddie Mac, Mortgage Bankers Association of America); McCain&amp;#039;s national finance co-chairman, Wayne Berman (AIG, Blackstone, Credit Suisse, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac); the campaign&amp;#039;s congressional liaison, John Green (Carlyle Group, Citigroup, Icahn Associates, Fannie Mae); McCain&amp;#039;s veep vetter, Arthur Culvahouse (Fannie Mae); and McCain&amp;#039;s transition planning chief, William Timmons Sr. (Citigroup, Freddie Mac, Vanguard Group).         When cable news shows air footage of McCain railing against greedy execs and the lobbyists who rig the rules for the benefit of Wall Street dealmakers, there ought to be a crawl beneath him listing these lobbyists. (Talk about a fair and balanced presentation.) Short of that, here&amp;#039;s the list of the McCain aides and bundlers who have worked for the high-finance greed-mongers McCain has pledged to take on. So far, it seems, none of them have been cast out of the campaign. If McCain were serious about his outrage, he might throw these money-changers out of his own temple.                      http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/...treet_aig.html     There is a TON of info out there detailing the links between McCain, Fanny Mae and other financial houses that are in trouble.
