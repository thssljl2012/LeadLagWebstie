McCain appeared to soften his opposition to the bailout proposed by the Federal Reserve, treating the plan as a necessary evil to protect ordinary Americans with finanical ties to AIG - and asserting that such a financial collapse should not be allowed to happen again. He also called for an investigation to uncover any wrongdoing.      &amp;amp;quot;The government was forced to commit $85 billion,&amp;amp;quot; McCain said in a statement. &amp;amp;quot;These actions stem from failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street that has crippled one of the most important companies in America.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;The focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies, retirement plans and other accounts with AIG,&amp;amp;quot; he added. &amp;amp;quot;We must not bail out the management and speculators who created this mess.&amp;amp;quot;           http://www.rockymountainnews.com/new...l/?partner=RSS       Down with capitalism.
