                     Re: Brokerage Meltdowns: Lehman next shoe to drop                                   It&amp;#039;s over for Lehman. We&amp;#039;ll hear something by the end of the day - BofA is trying to do the same thing to Lehman as they did to Bear - just buy the good assets and ignore the bad assets / debt. It doesn&amp;#039;t sound like they&amp;#039;ll be allowed that kind of a &amp;amp;quot;sweetheart&amp;amp;quot; deal again.      Next stop - Washington Mutual.       Lehman endgame: Barclays out     British bank abandons bid for Lehman&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;good assets&amp;#039;, according to source. Key banking execs and regulators continue to meet to discuss how to resolve crisis.       NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Barclays pulled out of talks to purchase Lehman Brothers Sunday, even as some of Wall Street&amp;#039;s most powerful executives and financial regulators worked to resolve the fate of the troubled investment bank and crisis facing broader financial markets.      Following earlier reports that the British bank was a leading contender to buy the Wall Street firm, Barclays ended discussions as of midday Sunday, according to a source familiar with the situation.      The source said talks fell apart because Barclays (BCS) would have to guarantee or settle all of Lehman&amp;#039;s transactions, which would require the difficult task of organizing a vote by Barclays&amp;#039; shareholders, the person said.      The company declined to comment on the matter.      Barclays, as well as Bank of America (BAC, Fortune 500), were said to be interested in buying Lehman&amp;#039;s good assets, such as its equities division, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.      The news came midway through talks on Sunday by top Wall Street officials and federal regulators over the fate of Lehman.      The participants, who started meeting Friday at the offices of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, are discussing several scenarios, according to several published reports.       One solution is a so-called good bank/bad bank option that would divide Lehman (LEH, Fortune 500) into separate entities.       Another would involve others helping Lehman dissolve in an orderly way to try to stave off a cascade of problems at companies that do business with the firm. The possibility of an outright sale to another bank seemed to be fading, according to the Journal.      The stakes are high.      Lehman -- one of the nation&amp;#039;s largest and oldest investment banks - has suffered a dramatic and rapid descent. Its shares, which sold for as high as $67 in the past 12 months, have plummeted 94% this year and now trade at $3.65.       In the past six months, the company has reported $6.7 billion in losses due largely to bad bets on real estate. At the same time, concern is growing about problems throughout the financial sector.      Investors are worried about whether savings and loan Washington Mutual (WM, Fortune 500) has enough capital to survive the credit crunch and insurance giant AIG (AIG, Fortune 500), faced with the threat of a downgrade to its credit ratings, is said to be considering selling off assets to raise capital. Both companies have also lost billions of dollars this year due to the subprime mortgage meltdown.      Race against the clock   Investors are anxiously awaiting an announcement regarding what is next for Lehman. The hope is that a solution can be agreed upon by Sunday before financial markets open in Asia and Europe.       A source with knowledge of the meetings told CNN that representatives of several major financial institutions have been meeting with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox and New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy Geithner to discuss Lehman and the volatile state of the financial markets.       On Saturday, several heads of big Wall Street banks, including Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain, were seen entering and leaving the offices of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York.       According to several reports, other financial firms are said to be reluctant to contributing their own funds to help keep Lehman&amp;#039;s more toxic assets afloat without the assurance that the government would backstop Lehman&amp;#039;s bad loans.       However, a source close to the situation told CNN Friday that the Treasury Department was adamantly against using any government money to help finance a takeover, restructuring or bailout of Lehman.      Top banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, faced heavy criticism from lawmakers following the bailout of Bear Stearns in mid-March.       The Fed helped engineer a fire sale of the firm to JPMorgan Chase (JPM, Fortune 500), agreeing to put taxpayer funds at risk by guaranteeing $29 billion&amp;#039;s worth of potential losses on Bear Stearns&amp;#039; portfolio.       A chaotic week for Lehman and Wall Street   The talks continue after what has been one of the most tumultuous weeks ever on Wall Street.      Things first started to unravel at Lehman Tuesday following reports that talks between the state-run Korea Development Bank, who was rumored to be interested in buying a stake in Lehman, had ended.       That, combined with the threat of a downgrade by some of the credit ratings agencies, led to a bloody sell-off in the firm&amp;#039;s stock.      Hoping to finally put all the rumors to rest, the company released its third-quarter results more than a week in advance on Wednesday, booking a nearly $4 billion loss and announcing a drastic restructuring plan. Investors were unconvinced though and the sell-off in Lehman shares continued, with the stock plunging 42% on Wednesday.      By Thursday evening, it was widely reported that Lehman was actively seeking a buyer for the entire firm. The company reportedly reached out to a number of suitors, including Bank of America and Barclays.      Speculation also surfaced Friday that J.C. Flowers &amp;amp;amp; Co. and other private equity firms may bid for all or parts of Lehman. Current regulatory restrictions prevent buyout firms from owning a bank outright, although the Federal Reserve has eyed loosening those restrictions as bank failures pile up.      But as Friday wore on without any news of a deal, Lehman&amp;#039;s stock wound up falling another 13.5%. Shares plunged 77% over the course of the week, setting the stage for regulators to call upon banking executives to get together Friday night and begin talking about ways to hash out an end to the Lehman crisis.       End of an era for Wall Street icon   If Lehman is sold or broken up, it would mark the end for one of Wall Street&amp;#039;s oldest and most well-known firms. Getting its start as a modest cotton-trading firm in Montgomery, Ala. in 1850 by German immigrant brothers Henry, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman, Lehman saw its fortunes rose and fell along with the rest of Wall Street.      After World War II, Lehman&amp;#039;s profile grew as it advised such household American companies as Ford, Campbell Soup and Philip Morris on deals, before expanding overseas into Europe and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s.      The firm also became a breeding ground for high-profile dealmakers. Both Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson, co-founders of the private equity giant Blackstone Group, worked for Lehman in the early 1980s.      But Lehman&amp;#039;s rise was cut short in April of 1984, when the company agreed to be purchased by Shearson/American Express for $360 million. The company emerged independent just seven years later, albeit in much weaker shape than it was before.      It was around that time, however, that CEO Richard (Dick) Fuld Jr., assumed the helm at Lehman and the firm went public after splitting off from American Express (AXP, Fortune 500).      Known for his direct approach and staunch loyalty to the firm, Fuld transformed Lehman in the decade that followed from a lowly bond trading house into a worthy adversary of larger investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.      Still there were bumps along the way for the long-time Lehman chief, including the Russian credit crisis and the painful collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in the late 1990s.      Fuld was quick to remind investors of those painful days and subsequent comeback during a conference call Wednesday, just after the company revealed its nearly $4 billion third-quarter loss.      &amp;amp;quot;This firm has a history based on adversity and delivering,&amp;amp;quot; said Fuld. &amp;amp;quot;We have a long track record of pulling together when times are tough.&amp;amp;quot;      But the obstacles Lehman faced this time around may prove too tough for Fuld to overcome.       http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/14/news...ex.htm?cnn=yes                                          __________________       Military men are just dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy. - Henry Kissinger      &amp;amp;quot;I admit it: the liberal media were never that powerful, and the whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative failures.&amp;amp;quot;    - Neocon Bill Kristol
