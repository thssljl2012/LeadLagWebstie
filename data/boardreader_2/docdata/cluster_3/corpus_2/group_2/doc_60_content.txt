 The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac problems appear to be to have been encouraged by the government. At any time, the Government could have stepped in and slowed down the bad loans but instead it appear it encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to keep giving out loans to first time buyers with well under 20% down and worse yet, less than even 10% down. The government encouraged this balloon to build and there were warnings out there for years about the dangers.       Don&amp;#039;t even get me started on ARM/Balloon loans.       AIG is not failing as an insurance company but as a investment company that is not regulated as well as it should be. Apparently as an insurance company it did not need to meet the same regulations as a bank. Our government has really let the ball drop on regulation of the markets and loans.
