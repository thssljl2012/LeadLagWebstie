  McCain says US not &amp;quot;in decline &amp;quot;          HE IS STILL SAYING THAT THE ECONOMY IS OK!           Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Wednesday he rejected the view that the United States was in decline as the country faces economic turmoil.        &amp;quot;I reject the doom and gloom that says our nation is in decline. America&amp;#039;s best days are ahead of us,&amp;quot; McCain said during a visit to a factory of US car manufacturer General Motors in Lake Orion in the Midwestern state of Michigan.        &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re going to take care of the workers. They&amp;#039;re the ones that deserve our help,&amp;quot; said McCain a day after the US Federal Reserve rescued insurance giant AIG from bankruptcy.        American workers are &amp;quot;the backbone and the foundation of our economy,&amp;quot; he said.        He also bashed his Democratic rival Barack Obama who he said had &amp;quot;exactly the wrong approach.&amp;quot;        McCain and Obama are fighting over who is best prepared to lead the country out of economic hard times after the government&amp;#039;s huge bailout of American International Group and a spreading financial crisis on Wall Street.        Obama has lashed out at McCain, saying the Republican senator had always advocated deregulating the insurance and finance sectors until his presidential campaign .
