In 1999, McCain had joined with other Republicans to push through landmark legislation sponsored by then-Sen. Phil Gramm (Tex.), who is now an economic adviser to his campaign. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to make the countrys financial institutions competitive by removing the Depression-era walls between banking, investment and insurance companies.      That bill allowed AIG to participate in the gold rush of a rapidly expanding global banking and investment market. But the legislation also helped pave the way for companies such as AIG and Lehman Brothers to become behemoths laden with bad loans and investments.       So between Obama and McCain, the two candidates who are running for president today, McCain deserves the brunt of the responsibility.
