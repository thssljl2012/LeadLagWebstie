                               Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (created by the government) caused a fundamental change to the banking industry.  Organizationsbegan originate debt, then push the risk on to someone else.  Look at the recent failures:  Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, AIG.  Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were middle-men that got caught when the risk couldn&amp;#039;t be moved - they weren&amp;#039;t originating the bad loans.  AIG was an end buyer for thier insurance investments.  It&amp;#039;s funny how people ignore how we got here:  The government decided people had a &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; to 30-year, fixed rate mortgages backed by Fannie/Freddie.
