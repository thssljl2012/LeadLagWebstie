HP posted US $91.7 billion in annual revenue in 2006 compared to US$91.4 billion for IBM, making it the world&amp;#039;s largest technology vendor in terms of sales. In 2007 the revenue was $104 billion, making HP the first IT company in history to report revenues exceeding $100 billion.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard       A few more comments on Fiorina...      As vice-president at AT&amp;amp;amp;T in 1996, she directed the strategy and orchestrated the initial public offering (IPO) of Lucent, the most successful IPO in U.S. history up to that point in time. In 1998, Fortune magazine listed her as #1 &amp;amp;quot;most powerful woman in business.&amp;amp;quot;     The next year, Fiorina switched to the technology company Hewlett-Packard (HP) and became its chief executive officer. In 2000, she also became HPs chairman of the board. With the support of the Board of Directors, she led HP into a controversial merger with rival Compaq in 2002.      During her tenure, the market halved HPs value and the company incurred heavy job losses.[3]  When Fiorina was asked by the Board of Directors to step down in 2005, the company stated that Fiorina had put in place a plan that has given HP the capabilities to compete and win&amp;amp;quot; and that HP &amp;amp;quot;look[ed] forward to accelerating execution of the company&amp;#039;s strategy.&amp;amp;quot;       After Fiorina&amp;#039;s departure from Hewlett-Packard in 2005, the company quickly prospered, overtaking Dell as the top-selling computer maker in the world. Her defenders, and even some critics, credit her with laying the foundations for that prosperity.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carly_Fiorina      In contrast, Obama&amp;#039;s economic advisor  Franklin Raines  left Fannie Mae in a shambles and may well have started paving the long road for the current credit crisis as early as the Carter years. And time may reveal that Obama&amp;#039;s fingerprints are all over this mess. On August 27, 2008 the Washington Post drew a sharp contrast in leadership between Obama and McCain on this issue, revealing that  two members of Mr. Obama&amp;#039;s political circle, James A. Johnson and Franklin D. Raines, were former chief executives of Fannie Mae...       &amp;amp;quot;To be sure, both Republican and Democratic politicos have held well-paid positions in the two firms or have partaken of the tens of millions that they spend on lobbying. But a few Republicans, such as Mr. McCain and Sen. Richard C. Shelby (Ala.), who has been chairman and ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, have taken them on over the years, warning about their use of an implicit government guarantee to pursue private profits. Meanwhile, Democrats were not only politically but intellectually committed to the companies, seeing them as innovative public-private institutions that have been a boon to homeownership. In the current crisis, their biggest backers have been Democrats such as Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (Conn.) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (Mass.). Two members of Mr. Obama&amp;#039;s political circle, James A. Johnson and Franklin D. Raines, are former chief executives of Fannie Mae.&amp;amp;quot;    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...082703021.html                       &amp;amp;quot;Adding insult to injury, one of McCain&amp;#039;s most vocal campaign surrogates -- former   Hewlett-Packard   chief executive   Carly Fiorina   -- volunteered that McCain wasn&amp;#039;t qualified to run a major corporation.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;To cite one example, McCain backed landmark legislation in 1999 that removed the walls between banks, investment firms and insurance companies. That bill allowed a company like AIG to expand beyond its traditional insurance business -- which is still profitable -- into exotic new products that ultimately brought the company down. &amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;  Here&amp;#039;s something that really ought to grab everyone&amp;#039;s attention: McCain supports   George W. Bush  &amp;#039;s idea of channeling at least some Social Security funds into &amp;amp;quot;personal accounts&amp;amp;quot; that individuals would invest on Wall Street. Some of that money would have been entrusted to firms such as Bear Stearns (failed),   Lehman Brothers   (failed) and Merrill Lynch (sold at a fire sale). Imagine what this crisis would be like if Americans&amp;#039; Social Security benefits were evaporating along with their housing values and their 401(k) accounts.   This is the man who&amp;#039;s going to reform the economy? &amp;amp;quot;     &amp;amp;quot;John McCain was telling the truth when he said that economics wasn&amp;#039;t his strong suit. In response to what many economists have called the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the Republican nominee has sounded -- and let&amp;#039;s be honest here -- totally, embarrassingly and dangerously clueless.&amp;amp;quot;     &amp;amp;quot;His now-famous remark Monday about how &amp;amp;quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong&amp;amp;quot; would almost by itself be enough to justify my assessment. But he committed what was probably an even worse gaffe on Tuesday when, as the behemoth insurance company   AIG   teetered on the brink,   McCain   took a stand. &amp;amp;quot;I do not believe that the American taxpayer should be on the hook for AIG,&amp;amp;quot; he said. &amp;amp;quot;We cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else.&amp;amp;quot;      your favorite newspaper:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...091803052.html
