    LC (the REAL Laureen):      .:       LC (the REAL Laureen):           .:              LC (the REAL Laureen):     NO HE DID NOT!! He has said that he does NOT agree with this bail out..          McCain, who in recent days has slammed what he called Wall Street greed and corruption for causing the latest downward spiral of the stock market,  said he had to change his position on AIG  to protect millions of Americans who could be hurt if the company was forced to seek bankruptcy protection.              Just because the Biased media wants to twist McCains words to say he somehow &amp;quot;changed his position&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;supports the bailout&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#039;t make it true. His EXACT quote was:         &amp;quot;The  government  was forced to commit $85 billion,&amp;quot; McCain said in a statement. &amp;quot;These actions stem from failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street that has crippled one of the most important companies in America.&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;The focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies, retirement plans and other accounts with AIG,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We must not bail out the management and speculators who created this mess.&amp;quot;          So tell me where in that statement do you see him saying he supports this bailout? Where in that statement do you see him say he &amp;quot;changed his position&amp;quot;? NO WHERE!       This whole thing is started because of &amp;quot;short sellers&amp;quot; and i would like to know who they are so they can all rot in jail.    LMAO.. he just talked about his support for the bailout on 60 Minutes this evening, I guess you missed that one eh ?  So tell me, how does it feel to know that you support a candidate who flips so often, even his own supporters don&amp;#039;t know where he stands on an issue ?           So did he say &amp;quot;I now support this bailout&amp;quot; or did he say the same thing that he has been quoted saying ALL WEEK LONG as I have quoted above?
