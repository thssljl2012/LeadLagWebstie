 Let the bank runs begin!        By ***** *****, Editor    September 15, 2008      The immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy will be a massive and manic flight to liquidity and withdrawal of funds and credit from banks, S&amp;amp;L&amp;#039;s, insurance companies and brokerages, leading to more failures.      Nothing can stop it at this point.       The stunning magnitude of debt owed by Lehman Brothers - $613 billion -- comes to light because of their public bankruptcy filing. No wonder that Barclays, Bank of America and other potential buyers took a few sniffs at Lehman&amp;#039;s books and walked away.       The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is the largest in the history of the world.       Banks around the world who lent money to Lehman must absorb immediate and huge losses of capital and liquidity. Even if they eventually recover some of their money, they won&amp;#039;t have access to it until the bankruptcy is completed.    Insurance companies (like AIG) who issue insurance contracts against financial failure and non-performance are next on the chopping block. Policyholder claims could quickly overrun their ability to make good.      Investors have figured this out already.      They paid almost $70 per share for American International Group (AIG) last October. Today, some of those could have sold their shares for under $6.00 per share, a drop of over 90% in one year.    And who will rescue Washington Mutual (WaMu)?       WaMu is the largest savings-and-loan in the United States, and is currently unable to raise additional capital. Lenders and insurance companies are backing away.       Investors loved WaMu last October when they paid over $37 per share. They could have sold the same shares recently for $2.01 per share, for a loss of 94%.      There are a host of other financial institutions that are on the ropes as well.      American investors and politicians laughed at Fortis Bank when it released this report on June 28, 2008:   BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM - Fortis expects a complete collapse of the US financial markets within a few days to weeks. That explains, according to Fortis, the series of interventions of last Thursday to retrieve ? 8 billion. &amp;quot;We have been saved just in time. The situation in the US is much worse than we thought&amp;quot;, says Fortis chairman Maurice Lippens. Fortis expects bankruptcies amongst 6000 American banks which have a small coverage currently. But also Citigroup, General Motors, there is starting a complete meltdown in the US&amp;quot;      American sentiment is rapidly changing:  Six thousand banks is a long way to go!      When chickens discover a blemish on an otherwise healthy chicken, they will immediately attack it and peck it to death.      The global financial market players are just as merciless.    __________________________________________      Boy!
