       So if AIG collapses, I understand this is huge impact? makes Lehman look like walk in the the park? So is it correct that although AIG is insurance company, they have been a backbone of support for all the bubble mortgage money and derivatives? No wonder the fed has been encouraging fellow street boys to step up to the plate on AIG. Is this like a FRE/FNM in disguise?
