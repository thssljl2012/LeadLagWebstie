 Two very large brokerage houses no longer exist.  Lehman bros filed ch. 11 and merrill lynch was bought by bank of america.  The only two left standing are goldman and morgan.  These collapses were due to the large write down of mortgages and mis-management afterwards.  AIG, the insurance giant is trying to stay afloat and is receiving restructuring assistance to do so.  The fed will not cut interest rates.  And some regional banks are going under.      It&amp;#039;s bleak.  If the fed didn&amp;#039;t exist it would probably be worse than the great depression right now.            Mom to Gavin 10.23.06 and Henry 9.04.08
