Senator Shelby said a &amp;quot;brushfire&amp;quot; approach to it all.  You let Lehman, a venerated Wall Street firm, fail, but you got heavily invested in AIG, which is a large, complex insurance company.  You bought 79.9 percent of it for $85 billion.

They could raise the money.  And he also says that what you&amp;#039;re going to have as an asset at the end of the year, that won&amp;#039;t be worth anything because all the good AIG employees will leave if the government takes it over.
