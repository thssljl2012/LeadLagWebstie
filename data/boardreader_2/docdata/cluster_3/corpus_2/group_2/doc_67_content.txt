  Lehman Brothers make it official by filing for bankruptcy. Merrill is bought by BofA. The Fed and 10 strong banks expand lending to weaker players.        Last Updated: September 15, 2008: 9:11 AM EDT      Biggest bankruptcy in history      Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; stock, which fell another 13.5% Friday, is down 94% so far this year    NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Wall Street awoke to a vastly different world Monday morning after one of its own - Lehman Brothers - filed for bankruptcy in one of the biggest corporate failures in U.S. history.       After making its intentions known just minutes after midnight, the 158-year old investment bank made it official Monday morning, saying it would file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.      Lehman (LEH, Fortune 500) said that its board had OK&amp;#039;d the filing &amp;quot;to protect ... assets and maximize value.&amp;quot; None of Lehman&amp;#039;s broker-dealer subsidiaries will be included in the Chapter 11 petition, the firm&amp;#039;s announcement said. Lehman said it is trying to sell its broker-dealer business and is in &amp;quot;advanced discussions&amp;quot; to unload its investment management division.      In related news, the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers said Monday that three of its partners have been appointed administrators to Lehman&amp;#039;s British operations.      The dramatic conclusion followed marathon talks by top Wall Street executives and federal regulators who worked through the weekend to come up with a rescue plan for the embattled investment bank and a solution to a still-unfolding financial crisis.      The news of Lehman sent a shockwave across financial markets overseas and threatened to roil U.S. markets in Monday trading.      Markets in Asia plummeted, while the selloff was just as acute in Europe. Major indexes such as Britain&amp;#039;s FTSE 100 lost 4.5%, while Germany&amp;#039;s DAX was down nearly 4%.      Treasury prices soared in a flight to safety by investors; the 10-year note yield skidded to 3.51% from 3.72% late Friday. The dollar was up versus the euro and the British pound but down against the yen.      Lehman (LEH, Fortune 500) shares, which lost 94% of their value so far, fell an additional 87% in pre-market trading Monday.      The Lehman news proved to be the biggest in a string of major announcements made over the weekend. By Sunday evening, the Federal Reserve had stepped in to try to calm the markets by announcing plans to loosen its lending restrictions to the banking industry.       The Fed said it would expand its short-term lending to banks by starting to take all investment-grade debt as collateral - instead of just Treasurys and other high-grade securities.      &amp;quot;The steps we are announcing today, along with significant commitments from the private sector, are intended to mitigate the potential risks and disruptions to markets,&amp;quot; said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.      Similarly, a consortium of 10 leading domestic and foreign banks had agreed to create a $70 billion fund to lend to troubled financial firms. The group of 10 commercial and investment banks which included, among others, Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500), Citigroup, Barclays and Morgan Stanley, agreed to pony up $7 billion each to create a $70 billion lending pool to help troubled institutions.       Similarly, The measure would also help resolve exposure between Lehman Brothers and its counterparties, the companies said.      And two major financial companies - Bank of America (BAC, Fortune 500) and Merrill Lynch (MER, Fortune 500) - had entered merger talks. By early Monday, the two had announced that BofA had bought Merrill for $50 billion in stock.      But it was the fate of Lehman (LEH, Fortune 500) that remained front and center. The company&amp;#039;s fate took a turn for the worse Sunday when Bank of America and British bank Barclays, both viewed as potential &amp;quot;white knights,&amp;quot; pulled out of deal talks, according to sources.      Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who has led efforts to help get the U.S. housing market and the broader economy back on track, applauded the steps taken by regulators and top banking executives.      &amp;quot;These initiatives will be critical to facilitating liquid, smooth functioning markets, and addressing potential concerns in the credit markets,&amp;quot; Paulson said in a statement.      As earth-shattering as those events were, investors were juggling other concerns as well. Still, investors were weighing news that insurance giant AIG (AIG, Fortune 500) planned to unveil a restructuring plan that will include the sale of part of its business to raise cash and boost investors&amp;#039; confidence, according to a published report.      Investors are also likely to await more data about troubled savings and loan Washington Mutual (WM, Fortune 500), which sought to provide assurance about capital levels on Thursday.      Race against the clock
