 McCain was against it before he was for it.    &amp;amp;#8220;I&amp;#039;m always for less regulation. I&amp;#039;d like to see a lot of the unnecessary government regulations eliminated.&amp;amp;#8221;  &amp;amp;#8212; Sen. John McCain, March, 2008 &amp;amp;#8224;    &amp;amp;#8220;Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.&amp;amp;#8221;  &amp;amp;#8212; Albert Einstein      Quote:                         Excerpted from &amp;amp;#8220;  McCain Embraces Regulation After Many Years of Opposition  &amp;amp;#8221; By Michael D. Shear, Washington Post Staff Writer,  The Washington Post , Wednesday, September 17, 2008; Page A01     I   n 2002, McCain introduced a bill to deregulate the broadband Internet market, warning that &amp;amp;quot;the potential for government interference with market forces is not limited to federal regulation.&amp;amp;quot; Three years earlier, McCain had joined with other Republicans to push through landmark legislation sponsored by then-Sen. Phil Gramm (Tex.), who is now an economic adviser to his campaign. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to make the country&amp;#039;s financial institutions competitive by removing the Depression-era walls between banking, investment and insurance companies.     That bill allowed AIG to participate in the gold rush of a rapidly expanding global banking and investment market. But the legislation also helped pave the way for companies such as AIG and Lehman Brothers to become behemoths laden with bad loans and investments.    McCain now condemns the executives at those companies for pursuing the ambitions that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made possible &amp;amp;#8230;
