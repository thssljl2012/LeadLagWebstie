Congress is likely to feel the loss as well of securities firms Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, as well as the downward spiral American Insurance Group (AIG), particularly in their campaign coffers.  The three financial institutions and their employees have given about $4.7 million this election cycle to members of Congress, presidential candidates and parties; particularly to those who oversee economic and monetary policy.  The political action committees alone for Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and AIG have focused their giving almost exclusively on incumbents, giving $340,000 so far this election cycle.  The leading recipients are members of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, including Democratic chairman  Christopher J. Dodd  of Connecticut, who took $20,000 from the PACs. Committee member  Jack Reed  , D-R.I., accepted $16,500 and ranking member  Richard C. Shelby  , R-Ala., hauled in $11,500.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman  Max Baucus  , D-Mont., and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman  Charles B. Rangel  , D-N.Y., also cashed in from the three PACs. Baucus accepted $15,750 and Rangel, $14,000.  Employees of Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, have each given approximately $2 million to political parties, federal candidates and their political committees this election cycle, while AIG employees have made $462,000 in political donations. Leading recipients include the Democratic Party, whose committees have raised more than $575,000 from the firms workers.  Presidential rivals Democrat  Barack Obama  and Republican  John McCain  have benefited as well from the firms. Obama has hauled in $638,000, half from Lehman Brothers employees, while McCain has raised $575,000, including $384,000 from Merrill Lynch workers.
