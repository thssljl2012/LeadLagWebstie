It then said that everybody understands that the crisis requires a big act by government. I was hoping to get someone to explain that part in some detail. So what if Freddy Mac goes under? There won&amp;#039;t be enough others buying mortgages and there might be less money for buying homes. Others will quickly move in to fill the void. The price of homes might fall for a bit, but that has already happened. If mortgages are not a good investment, then other investments will appear more attractive. How does this affect AIG, an insurance company? What were they insuring that lost them billions? Did they pay out on Katrina? Most of the insurance companies I heard about refused to pay. What about the investment companies? How did they lose money? Typically they take some of your money to let you purchase some stock. They always get their money up front, so how did they lose? So far it all looks like just smoke and mirrors     this is exactly what i&amp;#039;m wondering also. the president said if we don&amp;#039;t go along with this bail-out, businesses won&amp;#039;t be able to borrow money and people will loose their homes. unemployment is at the highest it&amp;#039;s been in 7 years so what else is new. people have been loosing their homes and jobs all year but there was no need for a bail out until the rich began loosing their millions. NO BAIL OUT!!!
