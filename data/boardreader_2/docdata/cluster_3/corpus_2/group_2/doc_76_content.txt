    dujac:       LC (the REAL Laureen):     No one. I was just pointing it out to you because you said it was a bank.   no i didn&amp;#039;t      Sorry..I thought this statement was referring to AIG:         dujac:         LC (the REAL Laureen):       WEre not going to have a depression. God where do you get these ideas from?How EXACTLY do you think ONE company going under is going to cause a depression...go ahead and explain it to me.       i studied economic for many years (among other subjects), at university     &amp;quot;Thus early bank failures led to further bank failures and bankruptcies and so on. Had the Fed been more accommodating, much of the domino effect would not have occurred.&amp;quot;      What Caused the Great Depression of the 1930&amp;#039;s?         AIG isn&amp;#039;t a bank. ......It is an insurance company. There stocks and mutual funds dropped in value and they were then overextended. Again...thats the risk they take and thats the risk people take when they invest their money in stocks and mutual funds. Sorry but..... too bad. What exactly were they doing with everyones money is the question I want answered.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       LC (the REAL Laureen):     And what dominoe affect? If they let them go under the only thing that would happen is other people would buy up most of those shares at a HUGE discounted rate, and some shareholders would hold stocks that weren&amp;#039;t worth anything anymore and would have to wait for the market to correct itself before making any money on them.     I have had that happen to a few of my stocks...thats the risk people take. It isn&amp;#039;t like you hand over your entire life savings to the stock market and hope it does well! Where as people actually put ALL their money into savings accounts and do depend on that money to be there and be safe. Which it is up to 100,000.00. So it isn&amp;#039;t the same as a bank.   you don&amp;#039;t know what you&amp;#039;re talking about        Well you are entitled to your opinion.
