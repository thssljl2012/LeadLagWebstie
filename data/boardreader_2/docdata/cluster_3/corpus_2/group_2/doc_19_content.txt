Where are the&amp;amp;nbsp; THANK YOU&amp;#039;s&amp;amp;nbsp; to&amp;amp;nbsp; ole UNCLE SAM??         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm-Leach-Bliley_Act    &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;       &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;nbsp;   I am a little worried because I am almost agreeing with you.&amp;amp;nbsp;  I would however make the&amp;amp;nbsp;following additional&amp;amp;nbsp;observation.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;   After we repealed the Glass Teagle Act we should have transformed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because when these government-backed entities were not privatised and thus allowed to fail, the whole government/private activity sphere is confused and perverted ...and thus there is zero accountability on either side and we have seen this fact&amp;amp;nbsp;being played out this week on our TV.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;   How is it possible that the books were cooked at Fannie Mae to the tune of about $6 billion dollars and the fellows responsible walk&amp;amp;nbsp;away with a huge&amp;amp;nbsp;bonus package and a little slap on the hand&amp;amp;nbsp;instead of getting a uniform to go to jail for doing something that is basically illegal?   &amp;amp;nbsp;   In addition, where the hell were the State Insurance Regulators that allowed AIG and&amp;amp;nbsp;similar insurance companies to continue issuing policies to back these so called &amp;quot;securitized-bonds, bonds&amp;amp;nbsp;that were&amp;amp;nbsp;needed&amp;amp;nbsp;for Fannie Mae and Freddi Mac to generate the required capital to maintain&amp;amp;nbsp;subprime loan operations.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Hank Greenberg the former CEO of AIG who was in effect pushed out about 3 years ago admitted in an interview&amp;amp;nbsp;on CNN and later&amp;amp;nbsp;on Fox that &amp;quot;risk controls&amp;quot; were relaxed and strict due diligence went out the window.&amp;amp;nbsp;  So they contributed to creating&amp;amp;nbsp;a debacle waiting to happen.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;   As subprime bonds became non-performing and their market value took a nose dive when property prices began heading south,&amp;amp;nbsp;the shit hit the fan but not all the way down to the gutter because in my book the failure of government regulation is that we should allow companies that blow it, to fail.&amp;amp;nbsp; Yes, unemployment would have gone to hell, and the Republicans would have lost the whitehouse-- underservedly because as the story goes, it was the democrats who opposed Bush from reigning in some of the abuses that were being played out in the early years of this decade at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but those are the breaks.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   We should also force politician who made the wrong judgement, especially those with oversight responsibilities in Congress, to resign their Committee responsibilities.&amp;amp;nbsp; None of this is happening.&amp;amp;nbsp; So executives are not going to jail and politician are not suffering -- and the taxpayers are the ones holding the bag.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;   And while McCain is not a saint of my devotion, I have to admit that he is the only one I have seen that has taken on entrenched interests.&amp;amp;nbsp; So you know whom I am going to vote for.   &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;
