 I don&amp;#039;t know how much more interventionist you can get than 80% government ownership of the world&amp;#039;s largest insurance company, AIG. This was the Bush administration&amp;#039;s solution to the AIG crisis. Their solution to the Bear Stearns crisis was to coerce JP Morgan Chase into taking over Bear for pennies on the dollar with a government guarantee to cover at least $30 billion in Bear losses.     Some people would call that socialism. And those decisions were made unilaterally by the Bush administration without consultation with the Congress. They then denied Lehman Brothers any government assistance, causing them to file for bankruptcy. At the same time, Merrill Lynch was persuaded to sell themselves cheap to Bank of America at the &amp;amp;quot;strong urging&amp;amp;quot; of the feds. Wachovia sold all of their banking operations (3,300 branches) to Citigroup last night. And four days ago Washington Mutual, the nation&amp;#039;s largest home-loan morgage bank, failed and was taken over by the FDIC. That&amp;#039;s a $310 billion bank failure. The largest previous bank failure, Continental Illinois, was only $40 billion.     Over the weekend, the Europeans nationalized two humongous banks -- one in the U.K. and one with headquarters in Belgium and the Netherlands. Both were caught up in the subprime mortgage mess.     Bush has agreed to a bill that includes about $25 billion in government guaranteed loans for American automakers, while these same automakers are currently selling new cars at a loss just to keep up market share. It worked with Chrysler many years ago only because of the genius of Lee Iacocca. And that loan, back in 1979, was for only $1.5 billion. The Big-Three this time asked for $50 billion!
