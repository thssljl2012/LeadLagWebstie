Now, as the Bush administration scrambles to prevent the collapse of the American International Group (AIG), the nation&amp;#039;s largest insurance company, and stabilize a tumultuous Wall Street, the Republican presidential nominee is scrambling to recast himself as a champion of regulation to end &amp;amp;quot;reckless conduct, corruption and unbridled greed&amp;amp;quot; on Wall Street.       &amp;amp;quot;Government has a clear responsibility to act in defense of the public interest, and that&amp;#039;s exactly what I intend to do,&amp;amp;quot; a fiery McCain said at a rally in Tampa yesterday. &amp;amp;quot;In my administration, we&amp;#039;re going to hold people on Wall Street responsible. And we&amp;#039;re going to enact and enforce reforms to make sure that these outrages never happen in the first place.&amp;amp;quot;     ________________________________________  _____      I can&amp;#039;t wait to see McCain debate McCain!                      LOL he&amp;#039;s gonna hold his own campaign advisors responsible too....lol      Sad almost nobody knows who Phil and the rest of McCain&amp;#039;s advisors are.      These guys are more powerful than bush or McCain.
