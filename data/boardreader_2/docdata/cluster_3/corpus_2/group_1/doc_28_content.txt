 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Barclays Capital said in its closely-watched global outlook that U.S. headline inflation will hit 5.5%   And the feds will have to raise rates 6 times by the end of next year to prevent wage-spiral.If it hesitates,the bond markets will take matters into their own hands. This is the first test for central banks in 30 years and they have fluffed it.They have 0 credibility,and the fed is negative if that&amp;#039;s possible.It lost all credibility.
