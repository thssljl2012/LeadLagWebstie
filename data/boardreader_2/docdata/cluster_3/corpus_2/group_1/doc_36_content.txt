Britains second-largest bank is this week expected to reveal a pre-tax loss of at least 1 billion for the first six months of the year, with analysts warning it could slide to as much as 1.7 billion in the red.        The loss would be roughly five times higher than the deficit racked up by Barclays in 1992 at the height of the last recession.         http://business.timesonline.co.uk/to...cle4449834.ece            OH dear - the banking goes into further crisis.... time for the regulators to rein in the banks and regulated them better...                       Not only the regulators, but also the rich shareholders who expected and reaped the benefits of the gullible public. All will suffer.
