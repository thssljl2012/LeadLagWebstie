Holders of SORL-AIM shares will need to approach their brokers to find out how they will deal with the GTE shares and what the charges are.So far I have been told by Halifax Share Dealing that they can deal these shares and the charges are OK (17.50 internet-20 phone.) I have had a slight argument with Barclays(more of a blazing row really)because they said they couldn&amp;#039;t tell me anything as they hadn&amp;#039;t received details of the merger from the registrars yet.I know TDW can offer an account to deal &amp;quot;foriegn&amp;quot; shares and the charges are good (12.50 per deal,there is an account maintenence fee but this is waived if you deal in the 1/4 or have 5000 of stock in the account)Hope this helps         thread start
