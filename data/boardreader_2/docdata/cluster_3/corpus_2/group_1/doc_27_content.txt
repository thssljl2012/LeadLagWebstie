             QUOTE (gruffydd &amp;amp;#064; Aug 2 2008, 06&amp;amp;#58;18 PM)       Some analysts remain nervous about Barclays&amp;#039; total exposure. For example, they have questioned whether it might need writedowns in areas such as its leveraged loan portfolio, where markdowns of 190m are less than 3 per cent of its net exposure of 7.3bn.  James Eden, a banks analyst at BNP Exane, says: &amp;amp;quot;Many do not believe that the level of writedowns taken by Barclays is adequate, notwithstanding the company&amp;#039;s constant and extremely robust defence of its methodology and approach.&amp;amp;quot;     IIRC they produced annual return early last year to avoid the new Accounting rules in the US... by about 8 hours. Something to do with Mark to Market, up till the deadline they could mark to model.  Looked fishy then, still looks fishy now.                               --------------------       Its not a house price boom, its a credit feast and now its time for the hangover        No Bankers were harmed or sacked without a decent payoff in the making of this Bail-Out.
