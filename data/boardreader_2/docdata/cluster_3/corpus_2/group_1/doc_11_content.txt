       AIG still a good short, ddown 10% after results,  AP AIG loses more than $5B on credit market troubles Wednesday August 6, 6:17 pm ET  By Madlen Read, AP Business Writer   American International Group loses more than $5B in 2Q as credit default swaps deal huge blow    NEW YORK (AP) -- American International Group Inc. said Wednesday that it lost more than $5 billion in the second quarter, as struggling credit markets stripped about $5.6 billion from the value of its credit default swaps portfolio.  The world&amp;#039;s largest insurer lost $5.36 billion in the April-to-June period, or $2.06 per share. In the same period last year the company earned $4.28 billion, or $1.64 per share.  After excluding one-time items, the loss per share came to 51 cents -- much worse than the 63-cent gain that analysts were anticipating.  Shares of AIG fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading, having fallen 80 cents, or 2.7 percent, to close Wednesday at $29.09.  AIG&amp;#039;s net loss included a $3.62 billion after-tax write-down in the value of what are called super-senior credit default swaps. Before taxes, this write-down amounted to $5.56 billion.  Credit default swaps, which slammed AIG in previous quarters as well, are essentially insurance policies to protect bondholders against defaults. So far this year, AIG has lost more than $9.5 billion, after-tax, due to credit default swaps.  Further dampening its second-quarter results, AIG&amp;#039;s general insurance segment saw a 54.3 percent decline in operating income to $1.39 billion, and its life insurance and retirement services division saw a 10 percent decline in operating income to $2.61 billion. The company&amp;#039;s asset management unit also suffered a decline in income.  Back in May, having posted two consecutive quarterly losses, AIG decided to raise capital in an effort to improve its financial standing. AIG said Wednesday that it raised approximately $20 billion in capital through the sale of $7.47 billion of common stock, $5.88 billion in equity units and $6.91 billion in certain fixed-income securities.  Then in June, the insurer replaced its then-CEO Martin Sullivan with Citigroup Inc. veteran Robert Willumstad.
