Over the past three quarters, AIG has lost more than $25 billion, pretax, to credit default swaps, and more than $15 billion, pretax, in other investments.&amp;quot;   $40 Billion is a lot of money- 10%of theentire insurance industry&amp;#039;s reserves, and that&amp;#039;s just AIG&amp;#039;s loss.    Next the FED will be allowing insurers&amp;#039; to borrow at its window.   SNAFU is a term I learned in the military that seems to appropriately describe the gravity ofthe Globalfinancial melt down.
