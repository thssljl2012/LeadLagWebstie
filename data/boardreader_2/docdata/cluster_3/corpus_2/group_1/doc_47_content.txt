    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              ETFs:top earners and bleeders of the year-G&amp;amp;M      Saturday,  August 16, 2008      ETFs: top earners and bleeders of the year       SHIRLEY  WON    swon@globeandmail.com     WHAT  ARE WE LOOKING FOR?    The  stars and dogs among Canadian-listed exchanged-traded funds this year.    ETFs,  which are mutual funds that trade like stocks, have grown in popularity thanks  to their low fees and ease of buying and selling.    With  the world&amp;#039;s major stock markets in the red, it&amp;#039;s interesting to see what kinds  of ETFs are making money, and which are bleeding badly.    TODAY&amp;#039;S  SEARCH    We  checked the year-to-date returns to Aug. 14 of all ETFs listed in   Canada   to find  the 10 best and 10 worst performers.    Barclays  Global Investors&amp;#039; iShares ETFs mimic mainly traditional and also specialty  indexes. Claymore Investments focuses on specialty indexes. And BetaPro  Management has the Horizons BetaPro bull and bear ETFs, respectively offering  double the daily gain and double the daily loss of the indexes or commodities  that they track.    SO  WHAT DID WE TURN UP?    The  iShares Canadian Income Trust Sector ETF was the top performer with a  15.2-per-cent gain to Aug. 14. It is also the leader among all Canadian income  trust equity funds.    This  iShares ETF, which includes 60 trusts, benefited from the surging energy sector  earlier this year; robust distributions of some of its members and takeovers.  Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Penn West Energy Trust and Fording Canadian Coal  Trust make up 30 per cent of this ETF. Fording, which is being acquired by Teck  Cominco Ltd., has gained a whopping 149 per cent.    The  HBP S&amp;amp;amp;P/TSX Financials Bear + ETF, which effectively allows investors to  sell short stocks in this sector, has risen 12.4 per cent. This ETF has made  money as Canadian banks and other financials have been hit by the fallout  emanating from the   U.S.    subprime mortgage mess.    And  bond ETFs, which might seem boring compared to the potential of their equity  peers, made up six of the top performers. The iShares Canadian Real Return Bond  ETF was the leader with a 10.3-per-cent gain.    Among  the dogs, the HBP S&amp;amp;amp;P/TSX Global Gold Bull + ETF has plunged 35.3 per cent  as gold stocks have headed south along with the price of the yellow metal.    The  Claymore BRIC ETF, which invests in  Brazil ,   Russia ,  India  and   China  , was on a hot streak last  year, but that&amp;#039;s no longer the case. This ETF has plunged 21.3 per cent as  stock markets, especially  India   and   China  ,  have taken a sharp tumble amid a global market meltdown.    While    Brazil  &amp;#039;s  Bovespa index was the best performer earlier this year among the major markets,  it began losing steam in late May on falling commodity prices and concerns  about rising interest rates.
