          I don&amp;#039;t have the latest statistics on Market Share, we will have to wait the RBS report to find out.      But looking at the statistics available (from 2007) it doesn&amp;#039;t look like they have ever been the top player on mortgages...      Adjusting for the Banks size, you can see why HBOS and Lloyds would be so much vulnerable to a Housing meltdown than RBS.
