  Finance News: 04 Aug 2008        Australia&amp;#039;s peak consumer body fears the major banks will consolidate their hold on the lending market as the credit crunch forces their non-bank competitors to offer fewer products...           .      As competition among lenders dries up, the small business council has urged small firms to shed staff rather than take out loans to cover cash-flow shortages during an economic downturn.      The extent of the lending drought was revealed this week when data from financial research group Cannex showed the number of low-documentation loan products on offer by lenders fell by 15 per cent in the first seven months of 2008.      Consumer group Choice spokesman Christopher Zinn said the major banks were more likely to increase their market share as higher global borrowing costs made non-bank lenders withdraw from the market.      &amp;amp;quot;Our fear is that without competition from the non-bank sector, it does allow the banks far more freedom to further their interests,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      &amp;amp;quot;The rise of the non-bank industry led to a lot of price and terms of conditions competition and new products, which was terrific for the consumer.&amp;amp;quot;      Cannex predicts that non-bank lenders will offer few low-documentation loans, which are often taken up by self-employed people who earn an adequate annual income but on a more volatile basis.      &amp;amp;quot;People are finding it risky to lend ... based on what&amp;#039;s happening on the capital market,&amp;amp;quot; Cannex financial analyst Joshua Zenas said.      In first seven months of 2008, UK-based banking group HSBC, Australian investment bank Macquarie Group and British financial services company Virgin Money dropped out of the low-documentation loan market, along with smaller non-bank lenders Bluestone and Ironbark Mortgage Solutions.      In July, 38 lenders were still in the low-documentation business, down from 46 in January, with 153 products on offer, Cannex data showed.      During that period, the major banks increased their share of the lending market even though they raised their standard variable loan rates in April and July independently of the Reserve Bank of Australia, which raised its rates twice, in February and March.      Cannex says the major banks will be in a better position to offer low-documentation loans as they are able to draw more funding from the deposit accounts of their customers rather than the global money market.      Council of Small Business of Australia chief executive Tony Steven said small firms were better off cutting costs than getting into more debt to cover their cash-flow problems.      &amp;amp;quot;My advice to small business is to be very careful and wary of loans to cover cash flow in a downturn in the economy,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      &amp;amp;quot;At times like these in the economic cycle, efficiency gains have to be instituted in a small business whether that means cutting staff, finding cheaper and quicker administrative processes such as using IT or simply cutting the cloth.&amp;amp;quot;      Signs of a downturn were highlighted on Thursday when the Australian Bureau of Statistics said retail sales fell in the June quarter, marking the first time in 12 years that sales had fallen over two consecutive quarters.
