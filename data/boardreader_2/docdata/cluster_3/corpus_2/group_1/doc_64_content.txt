   UK banking group HBOS has seen profits before tax fall 72% in the first six months of the year, amid a credit crisis and a tougher economic climate.      The firm said first-half profits dropped to 848m from 2.96bn in the same period a year earlier.     Bad debts rose 36% to 1.31bn as customers failed to repay loans.     But the firm, which recently completed a 4bn share sale, said it was better placed to operate in the &amp;amp;quot;more challenging economic environment&amp;amp;quot;.      http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7534428.stm       Lloyds TSB  was supposed to be the British bank relatively immune to the credit-crunch losses afflicting most of the world&amp;#039;s big  banks. So a fall of 70% or almost 1.4bn in its pre tax profits for the first half of the year is something of a shock.        http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereport...islocated.html    HBOS&amp;#039;s losses on its exposure to security markets knocked for six by the credit crunch have increased only a little to 1.1bn from the gruesome figure it disclosed only a few weeks ago, when it was raising 4bn of new capital in a rights issue.      Probably the most worrying trend is a rise of 225m in charges on mortgages where the borrowers are having trouble keeping up the payments.      And its mortgages classified as impaired have risen 21% to 5.1bn.      There was also a doubling to 469m in the charges for loans to companies that are going bad.      HBOS warns that losses on mortgage and corporate lending can only get worse.    http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/     A doubling in bad loans, and a 21% rise in impaired mortgages - ouch!
