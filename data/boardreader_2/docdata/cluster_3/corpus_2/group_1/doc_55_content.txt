  http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au...-20501,00.html            Quote:                         COMMONWEALTH Bank of Australia posted a 7 per cent rise in full-year profit, but its charge for troubled loans nearly doubled.      The countrys biggest mortgage lender said net profit climbed to $4.791 billion for the year ended June 30 and it declared a record final dividend of $1.53 a share.       The profit result was slightly better than market expectations, according to analysts estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.       But the bank warned it would remain cautious after its impaired loan charge jumped to $930 million, which was $496 million higher than in the previous year.       And the charge was up from $333 million in the first-half.       Volatility in global markets and a slowing in economic activity placed upward pressure on funding costs and caused an increase in loan impairment expenses, the bank said.       CBA said the headwinds the industry suffered in fiscal 2008 were expected to dominate the outlook for global banking for some time and keep funding costs elevated.       We are cautious going into the new financial year and the group will continue with its conservative stance until signs of improvements in economic conditions are evident, chief executive Ralph Norris said. The group&amp;#039;s capital position is strong with capital levels well above target ranges.                          Quote:                         Should you be annoyed or relieved that the Commonwealth Bank (ASX: CBA) reported a cash profit increase of 5% yesterday morning? It would be a refreshing result in an otherwise gloomy reporting period for Aussie financials. But the news might not actually be as good as it first looks.      The earnings growth rate was the slowest in four years, according to Bloomberg. You knew it was going to be hard to grow earnings in the middle of a credit crunch. But the more disturbing number is the near doubling of bad debts.      Bad debts rang in at $496 million last year. This year, they came it just under a billion dollars, at $930 million for the fiscal year. Bad debts as a portion of total loans went from 0.14 last year to 0.26 this year. Commonwealth Bank shares are down about two percent as we write.      You can see that bad debts as a percentage of the total loan portfolio are still pretty low. That&amp;#039;s good. But they are rising. That&amp;#039;s not good.
