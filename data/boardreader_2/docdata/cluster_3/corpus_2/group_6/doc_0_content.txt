travisbickle227, in trhe last few days we have had announcements that    - Anglo Irish Bank to be fully nationalised.  - Bank of America needs and to receive more bail out money.  - Reports anf figures indicating the recession is deepening.  - UK government to provide additional help and speculators (probably shorting speculators) have rumoured that Government will further recapitalise banks diluting share value further. However in reality the government is going to form a bad bank (toxic assets)and or relax the capital rating to encourage lending.    This could not have been staged or fabricated any better building up to the shorting ban. Had the FSA been competent they would have delayed the lifting of the shorting ban until after the announcement by the government of further bank help.    The shorter must have been laughing today thinking the UK government must be stupid.    However, what goes around comes around and I am convinced that shorters will be burnt on banks when sentiment changes.
