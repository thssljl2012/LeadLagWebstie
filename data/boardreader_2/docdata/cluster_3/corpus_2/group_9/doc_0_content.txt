in answer to the OP's question, the answer is simple.   Both BoA and Citi (2 of the biggest US Banks) took a pasting in last night.    If you dont follow the news, this was all on the back of Bank of America Posting a $2.8b profit, but at the same time warned of worsening loan default problems, and expect the trend to continue for them until the end of the year.  This is what drove the prices of Lloyds and RBS today.  Barc &amp; HBSC faired better, as they seem less exposed.   Now, to the latest (breaking) news...    * British banks are expected to write off another &pound;137bn in bad debts over the next year, according to an IMF report.   The report does not name and shame, but the 185-nation institution reported that British banks had already written off &pound;75bn in bad debts.  That figure was likely to increase by &pound;137bn in 2009/10, it predicted, bringing the total figure to &pound;212bn.  Furthermore, the cost of repairing the financial damage to the British economy was the equivalent of 13% of GDP    On the upside:  * US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner today has said the &#147;vast majority&#148; of U.S. banks have more capital than needed, which has so far today created a rally in US Banks, and this is before the results of stress tests on the balance sheets of the biggest lenders.     * I also believe tommorrow is a very critical day, not just for our generation, but also the next.  The budget announcements will be cruicial, and depending on the likely outcome we will see if we have bagged a bargain or not...   I personally think Brown &amp; Darling will be pushed out of government before they can kiss each other goodbye if they let any of the banks fail.     I really hope that you guys at least pay attention to the news before deciding to invest in shares.
