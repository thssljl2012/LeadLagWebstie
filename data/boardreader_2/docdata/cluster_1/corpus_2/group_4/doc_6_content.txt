   ABC Catches AIG Executives Hosting Another Posh Junket At Luxury Hotel      Last month, a House committee discovered that just one week after the federal government bailed out insurance giant AIG, company executives went on $500,000  retreat to a luxury resort . Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) asked in astonishment, Have you heard of anything more outrageous?  But yesterday, just as the federal government agreed to  increase its bailout package to AIG , ABC Newss Brian Ross reported that the companys executives gathered last week at a  posh resort in Phoenix  for a business conference, complete with  cocktail parties , limousines, and dinner out at a top restaurant. AIG instructed the hotel to keep its involvement secret, no signs with its name allowed. Watch the report: &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; AIG CEO Edward Liddy  defended  the extravagant conference on CNN last night, claiming that the lack of signage was a result of cost cutting measures. [W]e are really cutting corners. Were doing the same thing the American taxpayer is doing, Liddy said.  We are tightening our belts . We didnt use any signage. Watch it: &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Cummings has now called on Liddy to resign. That a firm already reliant on taxpayers funding  would organize such an event is outrageous , Cummings said.         The tools are the neocons, of course. The &amp;quot;Obama-haters&amp;quot; (in retaliation for three years of &amp;quot;Bush is a distaster&amp;quot;) that rely on Fox to tell them what they think. Sure, the bailout is bad, this only proves it! Right? Or maybe we should say that CEO should go fly a kite in Limbaugh&amp;#039;s back yard and WE the GOVERNMENT should appoint a REAL CEO and REAL Key Executives and get back to REAL business!? Hmm? Let me just guess which side you are on...                   Remember, it&amp;#039;s not like we&amp;#039;re making policy here. It&amp;#039;s just an opinion from a former Republican.&amp;amp;nbsp;      Fox News -&amp;amp;nbsp;the PNAC mouthpiece   &amp;amp;nbsp;
