     Just a side note,      The federal government announced a second bailout valued at nearly $150 billion for the troubled insurance giant AIG. The new plan calls for the government to reduce the original $85 billion loan that saved AIG in September to $60 billion, buy $40 billion of preferred shares, and purchase $52.5 billion of mortgage securities owned or backed by the company.      Wonder if the US can shower some of that wealth to poor people like us, instead of incompetent people    who are getting billions of dollars in bonuses at the end of the year.
