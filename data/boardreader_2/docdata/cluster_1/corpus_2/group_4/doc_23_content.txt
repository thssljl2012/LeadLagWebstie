 Insurance giant AIG spent $343,000 on an executive retreat to an Arizona resort last week, despite a financial situation so dire that the Treasury Department agreed to give the firm another $150 billion in taxpayer money Monday .     http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/busin ... ref=slogin    The company has already apologized for its October spree at the lavish St. Regis resort in California, which occurred shortly after the company received its first multi-billion dollar infusion from the government. It does at least appear that AIG has stuck to its promise to take the current economic conditions into account.  This time, the company tried to keep the event secret.

Quote:    The troubled insurance giant American International Group already has consumed three-quarters of a federal $123 billion rescue loan,  a little more than a month after the government stepped in to save the company from bankruptcy  .  AIG has borrowed $90.3 billion from the Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s credit line as of yesterday, the bulk of it to pay off bad bets the company made in guaranteeing other firms&amp;#039; risky mortgage investments. That&amp;#039;s up from roughly $83 billion AIG had borrowed a week ago, and the $68 billion level it reached a week before  that. The news comes as the company&amp;#039;s new chief executive warned Wednesday that the government&amp;#039;s financial lifeline may not be enough to keep AIG afloat.     http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/co ... id=topnews     Maybe they should go to a resort and spend a bunch of money on massages
