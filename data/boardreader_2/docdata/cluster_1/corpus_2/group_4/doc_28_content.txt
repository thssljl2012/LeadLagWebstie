Last month, a House committee discovered that just one week after the federal government bailed out insurance giant AIG, company executives went on $500,000 retreat to a luxury resort. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) asked in astonishment, Have you heard of anything more outrageous? But yesterday, just as the federal government agreed to increase its bailout package to AIG, ABC Newss Brian Ross reported that the companys executives gathered last week at a posh resort in Phoenix for a business conference, complete with cocktail parties, limousines, and dinner out at a top restaurant. AIG instructed the hotel to keep its involvement secret, no signs with its name allowed.
