61.7 BILLION dollar loss. Largest in history. And now another $30 bil more in help. It's like a bottomless pit.             AIG Posts Record Loss, U.S. Pumps $30B More    Government unveils a revamped rescue package to insurance giant American International Group and will provide the troubled company another $30 billion on an "as needed" basis.        WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government unveiled a revamped rescue package for insurance giant American International Group on Monday, and will provide the troubled company another $30 billion on an "as needed" basis. AIG also reported a large fourth-quarter loss.        The company has burned through cash and has been unable to find buyers for pieces of its business that it hoped to sell to repay the government on its existing aid package, which totals some $150 billion.        The new package calls for the Federal Reserve to take stakes in two international units.        Instead of paying back $38 billion in cash with interest that it has used from a Federal Reserve credit line, AIG now will repay that amount with equity stakes in Asia-based American International Assurance Co. and American Life Insurance Co., which operates in 50 countries.        AIG said it lost $61.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or $22.95 per share, after a loss of $5.3 billion, or $2.08 per share, a year ago.        The latest results include $7.2 billion in unrealized losses and credit valuation adjustments at AIG Financial Products, the source of credit-default swaps, and pretax losses of $21.6 billion tied to the declining value of AIG's investment portfolio.             www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/02/pumps-b-aig-insurer-posts-biggest- loss/
