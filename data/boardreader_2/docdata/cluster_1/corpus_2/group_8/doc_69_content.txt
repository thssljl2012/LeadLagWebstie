          The good thing about buying life insurance policies is that they offer a guaranteed payout. (assuming no counterparty credit risk).   Did AIG write life insurance policies? If so, it would seem there could be considerable counterparty credit risk.   And even if AIG did not write such insurance, others certainly did. Are they more credit-worthy than AIG appeared to be before "all this?" My guess is that some are and some are not.
