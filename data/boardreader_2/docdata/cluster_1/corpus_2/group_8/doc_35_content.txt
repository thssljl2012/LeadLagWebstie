(...Under the plan, the government will take a controlling stake in AIGs Asian operations and its global life insurance business - two of its most prized assets - as well as $8.5bn-worth of bonds backed by cash flow from the US life insurance unit. In return, the authorities will forgive most or all of the $38bn lent to AIG, reduce the interest rate on future loans, and provide a $30bn standby credit line to cover further losses....)  AIGs huge shortfall, which pushed its total net loss for 2008 to nearly $100bn, was partly driven by substantial write-downs on its commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).  AIGs results&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;were negatively affected by continued severe credit market deterioration, particularly in CMBS, the company said.  The value of AIGs $20bn portfolio of securities backed by commercial property loans fell by nearly a quarter in the three months to December, forcing a $5bn writedown.  The plummeting value of AIGs commercial mortgage securities will ring alarm bells at the many US banks and hedge funds with large holdings of commercial real estate loans and CMBS.  Bankers have been warning for some time that commercial real estate would be the next source of losses as the slowing economy forces companies to fall back on mortgage payments.  So far, commercial real estate losses for banks have been smaller than the one caused by the collapse in US house prices. But the poor performance of AIGs portfolio is a sign that the market is rapidly deteriorating, especially in troubled states such as California and Florida.  The rest of AIGs record loss was driven by yet another shortfall in the securities lending business and the financial product division. AIG also took a $25bn charge for tax losses it was unable to obtain during the quarter and goodwill impairment related to the fall in value of past acquisitions.
