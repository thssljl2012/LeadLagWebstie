Under the deal, the third government rescue of AIG since September, the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve would provide around $30bn in fresh capital to the insurer, lower the interest rate on a $60bn-loan and ease the terms of a $40bn preferred share investment. People close to the situation said the $30bn would not be injected immediately but would be provided as a standby line of equity that AIG could tap as its losses mount.

If approved, the restructuring will be announced on Monday alongside AIGs fourth-quarter results, which are expected to show a loss of around $60bn, one of the largest in Americas corporate history.     The latest rescue could put an end to AIGs 90-year-history as a standalone insurance conglomerate and undo decades of deal-making by Hank Greenberg, its former chief executive. However, government officials and company executives say it is the best way to keep AIG alive after its plans to raise capital through asset sales were scuppered by frozen credit markets, economic turmoil and lack of bidders.     They add that the new structure would give the government a better chance to recoup taxpayers money through the sale of its stakes in AIGs two divisions once capital markets recover.    However, the new bail-out of AIG could fuel public anger at the use of taxpayers money to rescue the ailing financial institution especially because it would come days after the government had to rescue Citigroup for the third time in four months.    The new AIG plan  first revealed by the Financial Times last week  would see the government, which already owns an 80 per cent stake in AIG, gain a large holding in two of its most prized assets: American International Assurance (AIA)  AIGs large Asian operations  and American Life Insurance Company (Alico), a global life insurance business with operations in more than 50 countries.    AIG would remain as a government-controlled holding company and run the main remaining asset, the US personal lines insurance, according to people close to the situation.     The companys foreign general insurance and International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), AIGs large aircraft leasing company, would be likely sold off at a later stage.    People familiar with the plan said the government would reduce the interest rate charged on a $60bn five-year loan to AIG from the current rate of 3 per cent over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) to just Libor.    That could save AIG around $1bn a year in interest payments. Insiders said the authorities were also planning to ease the terms on a $40bn-holding of preferred shares in AIG, which are currently paying an annual interest of 10 per cent.    AIG, the New York Federal Reserve and the US Treasury declined to comment.
