 AMD Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              it appears that AIG is going to be split up (eventually)                                      Description                 Federal Reserve Vice Chairman   Donald L. Kohn  testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on AIG in Washington.                                                                                            Highlights                This              morning Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn spoke before the              Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on the Feds              role with bailing out American International Group (AIG). The big news              from Kohn is that he gave additional details on the Feds new plan to              boost AIG capital and confidence that was announced on March 2. Kohn              also reiterated many of the Feds views of its actions with AIG as              already stated by Fed chief Bernanke.                               The new plan focuses on              continuing to provide capital and liquidity to AIG but also to divest              certain business units from AIG. The Fed will get about $26 billion in              preferred equity interest in AIG's two largest life insurance              subsidiaries, American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) and American              International Assurance Company (AIA). The actual amount will be a              percentage of the fair market value of AIA and ALICO based on              valuations acceptable to the Federal Reserve. This action would be a              positive step toward preparing these two valuable AIG subsidiaries for              sale to third parties or disposition through an initial public              offering, the proceeds of which would return to the Federal Reserve              through its preferred equity interest stake in these two companies.                               Also,              the Treasury will create a new capital facility that would allow AIG to              issue to the Treasury up to $30 billion over five years in new              preferred shares under the TARP as liquidity and capital needs arise.                               Another              component of the debt restructuring involves the use of an insurance              industry tool to monetize cash flows on a specified block of life              insurance policies already in existence. Under the plan, the Federal              Reserve would extend up to $8.5 billion in credit to special purpose              vehicles (SPV) that would repay the obligation from the net cash flows              of identified blocks of life insurance policies previously issued by              certain AIG domestic life insurance subsidiaries.                               The bottom              line is that the Fed and the Treasury continue to hold the view that              AIG cannot be allowed to fail and confidence in this international              financial conglomerate must be restored. But in the process, it appears              that AIG is going to be split up.                               Kohn restated the Feds reluctance and even distaste for bailing out AIG.                               "It              is against this background that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury              Department have taken a series of unusual actions to stabilize the              company. These have entailed very difficult and uncomfortable decisions              for a central bank. These decisions were particularly difficult and              discomforting because they involved addressing systemic problems              created largely by poor decision making by the company itself.              Moreover, many of these decisions involved an unregulated business              entity that exploited the strength, and threatened the viability, of              affiliates that were large, regulated entities in good standing.              However, uncomfortable as this was, we believe we had no choice if we              are to pursue our responsibility for protecting financial stability."                               The              Fed Vice Chairman went into some detail over the extent that the Fed is              watching over AIG daily operations. The Fed has no statutory              supervisory role with AIG but has authority of oversight from its              agreements with AIG to provide access to credit facilities.                               "The              Federal Reserve has a team of about 15 staff members, led by senior              officials, who conduct oversight of the company pursuant to the credit              agreement. The team has frequent on site contact at the company to make              sure the Federal Reserve is adequately informed on funding, cash flows,              liquidity, earnings, asset valuation, and progress in pursuing              restructuring and divestiture. Federal Reserve staff is also assisted              by qualified advisers in its monitoring and coordinates with officials              of the Treasury."
