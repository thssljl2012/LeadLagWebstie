If an insurance company loses money, isn't it because the insurance they sold and received premiums for, didn't work out and they had to pay claims?         What I want to know is if they lost $60B last quarter, who got the money?  That is who were the insured parties that collected on AIG'sd bad bets?         Or are they losing money some other way?           What am I missing?           thread start
