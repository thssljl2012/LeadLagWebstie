       It's not about AIG stupid... ...or the economy  Diane Francis, Financial Post  AIG, the worlds biggest insurance company, is not being bailed out. AIGs clients are and they include some of the biggest banks and pension funds in the world. So far the cost to American taxpayers has escalated from a two-year loan of US$85 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank in September to US$150 billion in December, then another US$30 billion this week.  But the cost to taxpayers has only just begun. The tab will likely hit at least US$447 billion in months or years, if not more. This is the amount that has been disclosed so far of AIG's underwritings, in the form of credit default swaps, to banks, pension funds, insurers and Wall Street firms.   http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/francis/archive/2009/03/03/pdac-again.aspx
