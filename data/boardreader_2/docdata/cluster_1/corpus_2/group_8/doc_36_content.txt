          The former chief executive officer of American International Group Inc. Maurice "Hank"  Greenberg , 83,  claimed in papers  filed in federal court in Manhattan Monday that  the company , once the world&#039;s largest insurer,  has ruined his fortune by lying about its financial health.   AIG&#039;s stock fell to 42 cents Monday, as the government threw a stunning new $30 billion lifeline to the insurance giant, even as it confirmed it lost more than twice that much, $62 billion, last quarter. The source of trouble for AIG, which has 74 million customers worldwide and operations in more than 130 countries, is its business insuring mortgage-backed securities and other debt against default. That business imploded once the credit crisis struck with force.  The government has now made four separate efforts to save the company, totaling more than $170 billion.  Greenberg was forced out of AIG amidst a controversy in  spring 2005  when the company restated its financial statements for the previous five years, acknowledging accounting improprieties, including "improper or inappropriate transactions." New York  regulators   later  accused  AIG,  Greenberg  and the company&#039;s former chief financial officer of  orchestrating an accounting scheme  that made AIG&#039;s financial picture appear brighter than it was,  misleading both investors and regulators.
