 Edited on Thu Mar-05-09 08:49 PM by cosmicdot         a reinsurance company, headed by one of Maurice Greenberg's sons, Evan, is somehow involved w/AIG ... conveniently, headquartered offshore.   The other son, Jeffrey, was at Marsh &amp; McLennan at the time, I believe, when, then, NY Atty Gen Eliot Spitzer accused M&amp;M of price fixing and collusion  http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/insurance/2004...  .   ~snip~ Some of the nation's largest insurance companies are accused in Spitzer's suit of steering contracts and bid rigging, including AIG, ACE (ACE), The Hartford (HIG) and Munich American Risk Partners. Other insurance companies are being investigated in a scheme that Spitzer said raises everyone's insurance premiums.~snip~   Maurice, fwiw, is Chairman of the Nixon Center; and, Evan is on its Advisory Council  http://web.archive.org/web/20050205063607/www.nixoncent...  .   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_Limited    company website  http://www.acelimited.com/AceLimitedRoot  /  2008 proxy to stockholders  http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/10/100/100907/i...

First, Hank promoted Evan to the rank of executive vice-president, putting him on equal footing with his brother for the first time in their seventeen years together at AIG, a move that reportedly blindsided Jeff. Then, in late spring, Hank convened a dinner at the 21 Club with executives of Jeffs domestic-brokerage unit. Hank had traditionally scheduled off-site dinners to announce good news, like promotions, so most of the executives were looking forward to the evening. But when they arrived, they found Hank in a foul mood. It was a general ass-kicking, recalls Jeffs de facto No. 2 at AIG, Bill Smith. Jeff got in the middle of it, and Hank beat the hell out of him. Several days later, according to Smith, Jeff told his subordinates hed had enough, and tendered his resignation. ~snip~   http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/bizfinance/biz/features/1...    I just sense there's a whole lot of iceberg below the tip.
