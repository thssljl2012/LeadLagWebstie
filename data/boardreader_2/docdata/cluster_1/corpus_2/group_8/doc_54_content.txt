Heard on CNBC yesterday that the old CEO is suing AIG for over 2 billion in stock losses.      They also pointed out that AIG is supposed to be selling parts of the company, but they are not really trying to.      If anyone here happens to have insurance with Audubon or AIG Agency Auto you will be non-renewed (Audubon) or you may see a healthy rate increase with the agency auto brand. Also don't be fooled by this new 21st Century Insurance you see on tv now, that is AIG with its new name.
