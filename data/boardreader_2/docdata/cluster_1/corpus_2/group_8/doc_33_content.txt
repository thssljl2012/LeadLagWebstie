The Dow Jones Industrial traded below the 7,000 mark for the first time since October 1997 after AIG announced a $61.7bn fourth-quarter loss on early on Monday.  The slump came despite the US government announcing that it would lend AIG $30bn.  The Dow Jones Industrial index fell 110 points, or 1.6 per cent, to 6,952 in early-morning trading.  The credit crisis and recession have now slashed the index&#039;s value since it hit a record high over 14,000 in October 2007.  The dive in AIG&#039;s profits, equal to $22.95 a share, was the company&#039;s fifth consecutive quarterly loss, and its value has now fallen by more than $100bn over the last five quarters.  Taxpayer aid    World markets have fallen amid concerns about the US economy [EPA]   AIG received $150bn in aid from the US taxpayer last year, but the US Treasury Department and Federal Reserve said that the ongoing financial crisis meant more assistance was likely to be needed.  "The Treasury Department will create a new equity capital facility, which allows AIG to draw down up to $30bn as needed over time," they said in a joint statement.  "Given the systemic risk AIG continues to pose and the fragility of markets today, the potential cost to the economy and the taxpayer of government inaction would be extremely high."  Al Jazeera&#039;s John Terrett in New York said that the government had also loosened the terms on AIG&#039;s outstanding loans, allowing it to pay less in interest.  The new aid package calls for the Federal Reserve to take stakes in two of AIG&#039;s international units.  Instead of paying back $38bn in cash with interest that it has used from a Federal Reserve credit line, AIG will repay it with equity stakes in Asia-based American International Assurance Co. and American Life Insurance Co., which operates in 50 countries.  AIG has been unable to find buyers for parts of the company that it had hoped to sell off in order to make repayments on its existing loan.  Help needed  Edward Liddy, the chairman and chief executive of AIG insisted that the firm would pay back its debt to the taxpayer.  "The new $30 billion is a standby line. It&#039;s not necessarily something that we think we&#039;ll have to draw on right away," he told the NBC news channel on Monday.  But Liddy backed away earlier statements about repaying the company&#039;s debt to the government in full within two years.  "It is clearly our goal. But we need some help from the financial marketplace,&#039;&#039; he said.    Source: Agencies
