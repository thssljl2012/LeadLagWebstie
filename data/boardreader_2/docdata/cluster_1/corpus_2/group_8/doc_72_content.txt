AIG Halts Talks, Data Access for Bidders of Life Unit         March 4 (Bloomberg) -- American International Group Inc. told employees the company suspended talks to sell a life insurance unit spanning 50 countries and is preparing to take the business public as early as next year.         AIG has halted active communications with two unnamed bidders for American Life Insurance Co. and closed the so-called data rooms providing access to financial data, Dennis Vigneau, the units chief financial officer, said yesterday during an employee meeting and conference call in Wilmington, Delaware. MetLife Inc. made a preliminary offer of $11.2 billion for Alico and Axa SA put in a bid that excluded Japanese operations, three people familiar with the matter said last month.
