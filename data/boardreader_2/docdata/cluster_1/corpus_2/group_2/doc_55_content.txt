AIG is a stock company listed on the New York Stock Exchange &amp;amp;amp; about 60% of the portfolio is commercial business, default insurance, as well as $50 Billion subsidy that leases planes etc.   In short they reinsured the MORTGAGE Loan Market. Expend so much money on defaulted loans they had a cash flow problem. Big Issues.  New York State Regulators detected AIG had low cash reserves. NYSR demanded that they raise their cash reserves. AIG could not do it.  AIG did not have enough $$ on hand. It is a big player on the market. Who is going to help them? The Federal Reserve is not a government agency.   It is Indep.Financial Inst. and the Gov. can not CONTROL them.  Fed Res said they will loan them $80 billion, with a crude % rate over 8 percent.  Also, the Federal Reserve NOW OWNS 79% of AIG. AIG has a matter of few years to pay off the loan. It is impossible for the Federal Reserve to LOSE THIS $$ wise.  Not only will the Federal Reserve make gazillions of money-   It is actually a brilliant move, the Fed Res. Stock holders are protected -AIG is financially strong,they got into the MORTGAGE MARKET- which was a BAD FINANCIAL MOVE. Obviously the CEO was fired when the Fed Res signed the legal papers to bail them out. Fed Res now owns that 79% of AIG.  Insurance indemnifies  Mortgage negligence with LOANS people could NOT afford the loans.  This has caused AIG STOCK to plummet. They were caught in the middle &amp;amp;amp; selling off assets at this point is a NO WIN situation.
