   AIG: CONVERSATION SHOULD STAY FOCUSEDON THE FACTS      INSURANCE CONSUMERS PROTECTED BYSOLVENCY STANDARDS      http://www.naic.org/Releases/2008_docs/AIG_solvency.htm    &amp;amp;#8220; As a holding company, AIG is a separate, federally regulated legal entity  that is distinct and apart from its subsidiary insurers.  The subsidiary insurers are governed by state laws designed to protect the interest of policyholders . State insurance regulators are committed to protecting the  interest of policyholders  and will work closely with AIG management and other regulators to fulfill this commitment.   &amp;amp;#8220; The No. 1 job of state insurance regulators is to make sure insurance companies operate on a financially sound basis . If needed, we immediately step in if it appears that an insurer will be unable to fulfill the promises made to its policyholders. This includes taking over the management of an insurer through a conservation or rehabilitation order, the goal being to get the insurer back into a strong solvency position.    http://www.naic.org/Releases/2008_docs/AIG_facts.htm       What are the facts?        Although AIG is generally known to the public as the world&amp;amp;#8217;s largest insurer, in truth,  AIG is a financial services conglomerate .       American International Group, Inc., is a financial holding company  that owns 71  U.S.-based insurance entities and  176  other financial services companies throughout the world. These  include banks ,  securities firms  and non-U.S. insurers , along with  other related businesses  like premium finance companies.       The 71 state-regulated insurance entities are not the problem. They are all financially sound &amp;amp;#8212; or, in insurance regulatory terms, &amp;amp;#8220;solvent&amp;amp;#8221; &amp;amp;#8212; and fully able to pay claims presented by policyholders and claimants.       The problem lies with the  AIG financial holding company  that is subject to  federal regulatory oversight  by the  U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).  The AIG financial holding company took on more risk than they could handle when  investing in collateralized debt instruments, such as credit derivative swaps on mortgage-backed securities . It is important to note thatthese types of investments are  financial products ,  not state-regulated insurance products . When the U.S. housing markets experienced a downturn, these risky investments  lost lots of money  for the AIG financial holding company.       Even if there was an optional federal charter for insurers, and some or all ofthe 71 U.S. based AIG insurance entities had selected to be regulated bythe federal insurance regulator,  the problem at the AIG parent company level would not have been prevented .        State insurance regulators are proud { Noted added by DQ -I&amp;#039;m soory but their Failure to regulate wiht the Fed under the Law is nothing to be proud of - in fact we as a Nation are all at risk because of the insurance fraud} of the important work they do every day to protect America&amp;amp;#8217;s insurance consumers &amp;amp;#8212; using conservative accounting and investment rules. It is this  conservative approach to investments  that keeps insurers from investing inordinate sums in  risky investments, such as the mortgage-based securities , which is what caused difficulties for the AIG financial holding company.       Even throughout the AIG financial holding company&amp;amp;#8217;s liquidity crisis, consumers remained protected by insurance regulatory rules that prevented the parent company from simply raiding capital from its profitable and well-capitalized insurance subsidiaries. A coordinated effort by the nation&amp;amp;#8217;s insurance regulators ensured that no policyholder assets were used for anypart of this transaction.       State insurance regulators have authority over intercompany transactions with the AIG insurers. They are closely monitoring any proposed transactions to ensure they will not threaten the ability of the insurers to paypolicyholder claims.       Insurance regulators from every state &amp;amp;#8212; but especially those regulators whooversee a large number of AIG insurance subsidiaries &amp;amp;#8212; have been involved in every step of this process, with the primary focus of safeguarding the assets of the insurers so t
