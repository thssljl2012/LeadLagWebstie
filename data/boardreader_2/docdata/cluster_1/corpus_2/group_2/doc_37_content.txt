This the day after they let Lehman go bankrupt.  I can&amp;#039;t follow this action, it&amp;#039;s too big, complex and fast for me.  I just feel its not good.      one pundit said the difference is that Lehman was insolvent and AIG had a liquidity problem but otherwise is solvent.          http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...d7M&amp;amp;amp;refer=home                            Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Rex_B                         If I&amp;#039;m not mistaken doesn&amp;#039;t the &amp;amp;quot;insurance&amp;amp;quot; side invest their monies using the &amp;amp;quot;financial&amp;amp;quot; side...                         AIG Inc. is the parent.  AIG Commercial Insurance is autonomous. There is, in essence, a &amp;amp;quot;Chinese Wall&amp;amp;quot; between the two. There are no insurance funds being diverted to the parent in order to resolve the cash crunch.  I regret that a government bailout was necessary but AIG is too big to be allowed to belly    up. This was released earlier this afternoon:           Quote:                         AIG ISSUES STATEMENT TO ADDRESS POLICYHOLDER CONCERNS   NEW YORK, September 16, 2008 - American International Group, Inc.
