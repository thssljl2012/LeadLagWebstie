    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Re: Anyone still buying eit.un and sdt.un - exchange offer  Plus info on Credit Default Swaps   Re: Anyone still buying eit.un and sdt.un exchange offer &amp;amp; Credit default swaps  Just heard back from investor relations at EIT and very non-committal on the exchange offer. She stated they have no specific plans to do an exchange offer right now but that could change in the future.      On a separate note: Just listened to Kim Parlee, (on the BNN Close), interview a past director with the SEC in the USA on &amp;quot;credit default swaps&amp;quot; and how they will impact AIG insurance. This was one very scary interview and may be worth a listen when they have the replay available on their web site - if you have the stomach for more bad news that is.    A brief synopsis:     AIG is the main insurer for Credit Default Swaps that banks and brokerages could take out to protect themselves in the event that some of the re-packaged sub-prime mortgages (and bonds that were floated out there to cover them) go into default. AIG sold insurance to other banks and brokerages to cover any losses that may occur if the sub-prime mortgages and bonds defaulted and because they didn&amp;#039;t see housing prices ever going down they never set aside any funds to cover all the losses they are now obligated to pay.     Because the US Federal government under the &amp;quot;Bushes&amp;quot; has been deregulating the American insurance and banking industry, there was no one regulating that they should have some sort of financial resources set aside to cover such insurance. IF AIG collapses then all the other banks that have been telling their customers that they have insurance to cover their sup-prime losses, are going to get nothing, and we will have another round of bank failures.     If they patch AIG together, with Federal Reserve backing and let the shareholders fend for themselves, (which now appears to be the most like scenario), then the American taxpayer will be on the hook for the rest of this sub-prime fiasco and have to cover all the credit default losses, which are estimated at potentially in the trillions of dollars. I think it was Warren Buffet that called all these wonderful new whiz kid derivatives, (like credit default swaps), as weapons of financial mass destruction. Well the nuclear bomb from AIG&amp;#039;s greed and stupidity - at not having any funds to cover these credit default swaps - is about to detonate and it is you and I that will get hit the hardest from the fallout!!
