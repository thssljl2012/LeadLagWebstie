    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Add AIG insurance to the list of dead men walking - (move over Lehman and Merrill)    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15aig.html?ref=business   Rush Is On to Prevent Big Insurer From Failing   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH  The American International Group, the insurance company, is planning a major reorganization and a sale of its aircraft leasing business and other units to stabilize its finances, a person briefed on the companys strategy said on Sunday.    A.I.G. became one of the focuses at an emergency gathering of Wall Street executives over the weekend, and was trying to arrange a capital infusion in the face of possible credit downgrades.    It was unclear whether A.I.G. would succeed in its capital search, but a person briefed on the discussions said it was seeking more than $40 billion even as it tried to sell assets to shore up its financial footing. Among the businesses likely to be sold is A.I.G.s aircraft leasing business, the International Lease Finance Corporation. Founded in 1973, the business has nearly 1,000 planes in its fleet.     Investors, afraid that A.I.G. would have to absorb further write-downs in its already damaged mortgage securities and collateralized debt obligations, have driven down the companys shares in recent days. The stock closed Friday at $12.14 a share, a decline of 46 percent for the week.    Several private equity firms were at A.I.G.s headquarters in downtown Manhattan on Sunday, and may inject billions of dollars in capital into the firm, a person briefed on the matter said.    A.I.G.s problems are not new. The company lost $13.2 billion in the first six months of 2008, largely owing to declining values in mortgage-related securities held in its investment portfolio and collateralized debt obligations it owns.     But the companys outlook grew grimmer last week when Standard &amp;amp; Poors warned that it was considering downgrading the companys debt as a result of further write-downs it might have to take.     As the credit storm has raged in recent months, insurance companies like A.I.G. have been better positioned than the nations banks and brokerage firms to weather it because accounting rules do not require insurers to mark the investments held in their long-term portfolios to market. Insurance companies like A.I.G. can hold their investments until they mature, riding out the ups and downs in the market for those assets.     But the moment it began trying to raise capital, A.I.G. had to open its books to potential investors who were likely to take a sharp pencil to the companys portfolio values, analysts said. And with Lehman Brothers last week providing investors with a valuation for the same types of assets held by A.I.G., subprime and Alt-A mortgage securities, the investment banks marks can now be applied to the big insurers books.    As of the most recent quarter, for example, A.I.G. had $20 billion of subprime mortgages marked at 69 cents on the dollar and $24 billion in Alt-A securities valued at 67 cents on the dollar.     But Lehman officials on a conference call with investors last week said it was valuing similar subprime mortgage securities to those held by A.I.G. at 34 cents on the dollar; its mark on the Alt-A holdings was 39 cents. Those valuations suggest almost a $14 billion decline in A.I.G.s holdings, after taxes, an amount representing 18 percent of the companys book value.     Additional write-downs may also be required in A.I.G.s collateralized debt obligations, which the company does mark to market because they are held in a short-term account known as available for sale. The company valued $42 billion in high-grade holdings at 75 cents on the dollar, while it marked another $16 billion in lower-rated obligations at 70 cents.    A spokesman for A.I.G., Nicholas J. Ashooh, said it was inappropriate to compare the markdowns of Lehman Brothers securities with those at A.I.G.     We dont think thats valid, to look at somebody elses portfolio markdowns and then infer what A.I.G.s might be, because theres so many variables, Mr. Ashooh said, what kind of risk is in the portfolio, what kind of collateral there is, and how the marks were calculated. We think we use a very thorough and conservative approach that includes third-party input and input from the rating services.     A.I.G., which is based in New York, has also been under pressure from the derivatives contracts that its London-based financial products unit sold in connection with complex debt securities. Those contracts, called credit default swaps, acted as a type of insurance on the debt securities, making them more attractive to buyers. The swaps also gave speculators an opportunity to bet on the debt securities overall creditworthiness, which has declined in response to the turmoil in the housing markets.     When A.I.G.s financial products unit sold the credit default swaps, it effectively promised to compensate buyers of the debt securities if the mortgages underlying them got into trouble. At the time, the securities were rated AAA, so it seemed at first that A.I.G. was not taking on inordinate risk.     But that picture changed as the housing crisis took hold and homeowners began to default. A.I.G. wrote down the value of its swap portfolio by $25 billion, telling investors that the markdowns did not represent a cash loss of that magnitude. It estimated possible cash payouts on the swaps of between $5 billion and $8 billion.     But because the debt securities covered by the swaps are so complex and opaque, it has been hard for investors to verify A.I.G.s numbers on their own, and investors have grown impatient as A.I.G. reported big losses they did not expect in the last two quarters.     A.I.G. also said recently that it might have to post collateral to its swap counterparties, heightening concerns that the company would have to raise capital in tight markets. A.I.G. said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that if its own credit were downgraded one notch by Moodys and Standard &amp;amp; Poors, its swap contracts would require it to post collateral of about $13 billion.     In addition, A.I.G. said some of the contracts gave counterparties the option to terminate their swaps, which would cost A.I.G. between $4 billion and $5 billion. A.I.G. said that it did not expect all of its counterparties to exercise that option, however.     As a result, when S.&amp;amp; P. announced a negative outlook for A.I.G.s credit on Friday, investors understood the company might soon have to produce up to $18 billion
