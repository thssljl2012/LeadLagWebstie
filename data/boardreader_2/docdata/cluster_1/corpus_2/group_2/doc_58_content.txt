In addition to the shareholders and bondholders, you also have the people who purchased AIG spread products (insurance, fixed annuities and CD&amp;#039;s).      AIG does sell investments too, but these, like at Lehman are held in &amp;quot;managed&amp;quot; accounts.&amp;amp;nbsp; Those assets are NOT co-mingled with the AIG company assets called &amp;quot;Owned&amp;quot; assets.&amp;amp;nbsp; These assets are the premiums people pay on their life insurance or deposits to CD or fixed annuities.&amp;amp;nbsp; These dollars go into the AIG general funds, where they are invested to achieve returns.&amp;amp;nbsp; The insurance model is to generate a spread between what is earned on their assets and what they have to pay out on their assets.&amp;amp;nbsp; For example their owned assets might be invested to return 7.5% while  they pay out 5.0%.&amp;amp;nbsp; This results in a spread margin of 2.5%.&amp;amp;nbsp; Out of  the 2.5% net spread they cover their administrative and operating  expenses.      All dollars from each life insurance, annuity or CD buyer gets put in the same pot and shows up on AIG&amp;#039;s balance sheet.&amp;amp;nbsp; A mutual fund investor&amp;#039;s asstes are held in separate accounts and not co-mingled with the companies assets.&amp;amp;nbsp; (In a sense mutual funds are co-mingled with other investors dollars but they award and keep track of shares of interest for each investor, but they are NOT mixed with company assets.)&amp;amp;nbsp;       Because assets are co-mingled Insurance companies have much higher capital requirements (2% or more of assets) than an investment bank ($25k) because they have other people&amp;#039;s money mixed with their own.      Far more people get hurt when AIG goes under compared to Lehman.&amp;amp;nbsp; In addition when an insurance company fails, the industry is forced to essentially cover the owned asset obligation by using proceeds from the guarantee fund which all insurance companies contribute to.&amp;amp;nbsp; The last thing you want is to wipe that out in one swoop with the largest insurer going belly up.      I still think that the bailout should be from a private investor group vs. the govt.&amp;amp;nbsp; Hope this helps.      Nas            thread start
