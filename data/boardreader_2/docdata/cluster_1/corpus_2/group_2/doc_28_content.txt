The chief executive officer of AIG General Insurance, Brad M.Bennett said, policies underwritten by the company are direct obligations of its regulated business which is subject to stringent local regulatory and capital requirements according to the Insurance Act 1996 and Regulations.     &amp;quot;We are proud to be a locally incorporated insurer, with 100 percent of our total assets invested in Malaysia.     &amp;quot;Our capital and margin of solvency are well in excess of what is required by the Bank Negara Malaysia to meet obligations to policyholders,&amp;quot; he said in a statement Wednesday.     The statement follows news that the giant American International Group Inc in the United States is reeling from billions of dollars in souring mortgage debts.     On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board announced that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would provide a two-year, US$85 billion secured revolving credit facility to AIG to ensure the company met its liquidity needs. - Bernama
