           basically AIG sold credit default swap (CDS) contracts on lehman holdings - basically, insurance on the credit.  so when lehman went under, AIG suddenly became liable for all this &amp;amp;quot;insurance&amp;amp;quot; they wrote.    the market is interconnected in ways it never was.  which is why one firm going down triggers others to fall.    AIG hasn&amp;#039;t been downgraded...if it is...holy fuck
