 In American International Group&amp;#039;s darkest hour, former chairman Maurice Greenberg wants the company&amp;#039;s current chieftain to know he&amp;#039;s there to help--and maybe a little more.  &amp;quot;I do not know whether or not it is now too late to save AIG (nyse: AIG - news - people ),&amp;quot; Greenberg wrote in a letter today to AIG Chief Executive Robert Willumstad, as the firm teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, pleading with Fed bankers for a lifeline. &amp;quot;But we owe it to AIG&amp;#039;s shareholders, creditors and our country to try.&amp;quot;  Another option: Greenberg might just try to take back the company. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, he said he continues to retain Perella Weinberg to advise on the business, operations and financial condition of AIG. He also said that C.V. Starr, its affiliates and Greenberg may pursue a variety of options, including acquisitions of assets, loans or other financings, or further investments. Greenberg controls about 12% of AIG&amp;#039;s shares through C.V. Starr &amp;amp; Co. and personal holdings.    http://www.forbes.com/business/2008/09/16/aig-insurance...      This is not an altruistic move by Mr. Greenberg. It smells like a contest of chutzpah to me.
