My assertion was the same your Board of Directors made:         By JEANNINE AVERSA, IEVA M. AUGSTUMS and STEPHEN BERNARD, AP Business Writers    2 hours, 29 minutes ago          ......       In a statement late Tuesday, AIG&amp;#039;s board of directors said the loan will protect all AIG policy holders, address concerns of rating agencies and buy the company time to sell off assets.       ......   The worries were heightened Monday after Moody&amp;#039;s Investor Service, Standard and Poor&amp;#039;s and Fitch Ratings lowered AIG&amp;#039;s credit ratings, forcing AIG to seek more money for collateral against its insurance contracts. Without that money, AIG would have defaulted on its obligations and the buyers of its insurance  such as banks and other financial companies  would have found themselves without protection against losses on the debt they hold.
