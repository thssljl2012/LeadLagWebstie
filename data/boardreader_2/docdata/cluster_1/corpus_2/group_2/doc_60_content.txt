  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/b...&amp;amp;amp;hp&amp;amp;amp;oref=slogin     The governor and insurance regulator of New York have authorized for AIG to transfer capital from its consumer insurance and investment subsidiaries, to help bail out its unrelated monoline insurance subsidiary, which is certainly dead from roughly $20BLN of imminent ABS CDS default-loss claims.      If you have an auto, life, disability, or homeowner insurance policy from AIG, or have invested in its annuity or retirement plans, and are thereby very dependent upon its claims-paying capacity, you should be very worried.        This stupid move by Governor Paterson, Commissioner Dinallo, and AIG will spread the contagion from the institutional to the retail side of this insurer, violating fiduciary responsibilities to individual policyholders and investors.
