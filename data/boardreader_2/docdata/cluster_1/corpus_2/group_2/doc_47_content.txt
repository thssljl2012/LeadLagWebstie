                    AIG falls 42% in cash scramble    Tami Luhby   CNNMoney.com September 16, 2008: 10:48 AM EDT      Shares of American International Group tumbled Tuesday as the    company scrambled to raise as much as $75 billion to keep itself afloat.       If AIG were to fail, the global ripple effects would be unprecedented,    said Robert Bolton, managing director at Mendon Capital Advisors Corp.    It has $1 trillion in assets and operates in 130 countries.      AIG is a major player in the credit default swaps market, an insurance-   like contracts that guarantee against a company defaulting on its debt.    Also, it is a huge provider of life insurance, property and casualty    insurance and annuities.      &amp;amp;quot;If AIG fails and can&amp;#039;t make good on its obligations, forget it,&amp;amp;quot; Bolton    said. &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s as big a wave as you&amp;#039;re going to see.&amp;amp;quot;             .
