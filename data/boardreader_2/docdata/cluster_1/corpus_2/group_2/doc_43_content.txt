Losses on mortgage securities forced insurance giant  AIG  Tuesday to accept a punitive bailout from Washington to avoid a bankruptcy filing the next day. The deal could make Uncle Sam a winner and shareholders a loser.    Under the rescue plan, the Federal Reserve will make available an $85 billion revolving credit line to AIG (ticker: AIG). In return, it will receive warrants that, upon exercise, would give the government a 79.9% common-stock interest in the company. The interest rate will float at 8.5 percentage points above the London interbank offered rate, which currently would make the rate for AIG about 11.5%. And since AIG has about 2.7 billion common shares outstanding, the warrants would give the Fed about 10.7 billion shares, putting total shares outstanding at 13.4 billion.    Of major moment is whether the government will take a loss on the $85 billion two-year credit facility. Probably not -- it might even make a profit -- although it&amp;#039;s uncertain what AIG might net from the sale of diverse global assets that include operations in property and casualty insurance, life and retirement products, the world&amp;#039;s largest airplane-leasing businesses, an American consumer finance outfit and a large U.S. mortgage insurer.                                                                            ChrisHondros/GettyImages                         The government line of credit, with all the company&amp;#039;s assets pledged to it, is senior to other AIG debt, meaning that Uncle Sam will be the alpha male lion chomping on the insurer&amp;#039;s carcass before any other creditors can move in.    As for the common stock, it will likely be toast, despite the many brokerage-house reports that have estimated its eventual value at anywhere from $2 to $10 a share even after the huge dilution following an exercise of the government warrants. For one thing, AIG&amp;#039;s senior, unsecured debt was trading at around 60 cents on the dollar late last week; if the debt takes any loss, the equity, of course, is wiped out.    Yet such considerations didn&amp;#039;t stop FBR Capital Markets from estimating AIG&amp;#039;s breakup value, or what might be available to shareholders, at as much as $150 billion or more. That would be roughly twice the $78.1 billion that AIG reported as its net worth as of June 30.    But even that number seems wildly inflated. One would have to deduct $10.7 billion in goodwill, at least half of the $46.7 billion in deferred acquisition costs (early surrender of policies will keep AIG from fully recouping agent commissions it has fronted) and at least $20 billion in mismarked real-estate assets.     AND EVEN A SHRUNKEN CURRENT net worth of, say, $25 billion is likely too generous. The company, whether it likes it or not, is in a run-off and liquidation mode. Distress sales fail to garner rich prices since potential bidders sense a certain desperation. Yet AIG doesn&amp;#039;t have the luxury of time.    An insider tells Barron&amp;#039;s that the company&amp;#039;s brush with bankruptcy has particularly harmed its all-important insurance business. Key employees are looking for other jobs. Business buyers of property and casualty insurance are refusing to renew policies or demanding repayment of premiums covering time left on existing policies. Retirement-plan sponsors are heading for the hills. New business evaporates on both the life and casualty sides. Why deal with a wounded carrier in what&amp;#039;s basically a commodity business when so many financially unblemished competitors are available? &amp;quot;People have to only look back to how quickly other insurers like Reliance Insurance burned down once they got into financial trouble,&amp;quot; our source says.     Barron&amp;#039;s heartily recommended buying the stock earlier this year (&amp;quot; AIG&amp;#039;s Selloff: a Huge Opportunity ,&amp;quot; Feb. 18) when the stock had fallen to about 45. After rallying for a time, it resumed its decline, prompting us in a June 23 Follow-Up column to advise bailing out after a top management change and continued write-downs of AIG derivatives tied to subprime securitizations. The stock then was trading at around 32.    The latest crisis unfolded with stunning rapidity. On the weekend beginning Sept. 12, eyes were fixed on Lehman&amp;#039;s death throes when rumors began swirling that AIG needed $40 billion in new capital. By Monday, the figure had risen to $75 billion, and on Tuesday to the $85 billion it obtained that evening. The government acted only after a large bank consortium said it couldn&amp;#039;t raise the amount and various private-equity concerns took a pass.    At first, it seemed to be a liquidity problem. As is typical with insurance companies, most of its capital is trapped in regulated state entities, making the holding company, at the top of the capital structure, vulnerable to sudden capital needs. That&amp;#039;s what happened on that Tuesday after the company suffered a credit downgrade from S&amp;amp;amp;P, Moody&amp;#039;s and Fitch.     IT WAS THUS FORCED to pony up nearly $20 billion both as collateral and early-termination payments on underwater credit-default swaps (CDS) that the company had sold to a number of U.S. investment banks and European banks as insurance against any decline in the value of collateralized debt obligations they owned that were full of subprime mortgage paper.       Many suspect that AIG&amp;#039;s exposure to bad mortgages and other debt paper is far larger than reflected in its second- quarter financials. For example, AIG at the end of the quarter had sold insurance, or CDS, against some $447 billion of securities filled with mortgage and corporate- loan paper. Of greatest concern is the $80 billion of this insured portfolio largely backed by subprime mortgages. Only $24.8 billion has been charged off so far, which seems extremely light.    Unbeknownst to Wall Street until the Texas insurance commissioner blew the whistle in June, AIG was also taking cash generated by its life-insurance subsidiaries in return for lending out their investment securities and putting it into long-term subprime mortgage paper rather than shorter-term liquid investments. So when the borrowed shares were returned and AIG was compelled to return the cash, it suffered nasty losses selling the now-price-depressed mortgage paper. Some estimate that these capers may ultimately cost AIG another $20 billion.    Finally, AIG at the end of the second quarter was sitting on $23 billion in unrealized losses in its insurance investment portfolio. More than likely a goodly part of these losses will have to be taken soon.    So it seems that insensate speculation, particularly at AIG Financial Products&amp;#039; Wilton, Conn., trading room, has done in a venerable financial enterprise built over four decades by onetime chief Maurice &amp;quot;Hank&amp;quot; Greenberg, who was deposed after an accounting scandal in 2005.    Rumors are circulating that Greenberg is forming a group to pay off the U.S. loan and void the warrants that would give Uncle Sam nearly 80% of AIG. We don&amp;#039;t put much credence in this possibility, even though the stock jumped 43% Friday to 3.85.     -- Jonathan R. Laing
