Just to clarify this is not so much about an insurance company  -- AIG is well-known for its insurance but that was a set of subsidiaries unrelated to the investment banking arm with all the problems.  This  group structure chart  might clarify things.    My biggest concern was the New York state government allowing AIG to pull 20 billion from its other subsidiaries to help the investment sub.  There is a reason why insurance regulators do not allow corporate groups to pull money from one entity to the other, it is so that policyholders stay protected and above any other creditor.  By allowing AIG to pull money from the insurance arm it is in essence letting money that was earmarked for policyholders now go to pay off credit default swap holders.  If enough money was transferred then the insurance area could also be in trouble.         I was wondering about that.  Does it also do life insurance, that is, investments on behalf of policy holders?  Have they lost everything?    Isn&amp;#039;t moving that money illegal, and wouldn&amp;#039;t they be up for criminal charges?    Hurricane Andrew was enough to kill off a large Australian re-insurer, that found itself &amp;#039;holding the parcel&amp;#039;. Who is going to be up for Ike?  It sounds very similar to Andrew. Not a CAT5, but causing widespread damage with a large economic impact.
