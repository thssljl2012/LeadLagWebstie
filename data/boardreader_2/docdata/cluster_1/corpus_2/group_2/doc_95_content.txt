update:      Rating agencies downgrade AIG           Quote:                         Moody&amp;#039;s Investors Service cut AIG&amp;#039;s rating to A2 from Aa3, a two-notch downgrade. Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s Ratings Services lowered the rating to A-minus from AA-minus, a three-peg reduction and Fitch Ratings reduced its standing to A from AA-minus, a two notch cut.                     Now who the hell would wanna buy insurance from a company with less than AAA rating?      AIG is so screwed.
