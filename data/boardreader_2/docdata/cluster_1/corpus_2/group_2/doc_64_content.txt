I believe that at least the life insurance and perhaps the life annuity are covered by the guarantee fund in the state where you purchased them.   (Meaning the state will cover up to a certain amount kinda like FDIC)      I would contact your insurance agent.      Personally, I don&amp;#039;t think AIG would go bankrupt per se but might have to seek a capital infusion.
