 From Morning star, to again counter Red&amp;#039;s claim that the parent company would lien on the P&amp;amp;amp;C business:             Quote:                         AIG continues to pursue alternatives to increase short-term liquidity in the parent company. Those plans do not include any effort to reduce the capital of any of its subsidiaries or to tap into Asian operations for liquidity.      The insurance policies written by AIG companies are direct obligations of its regulated subsidiary insurance companies around the world. These companies are well capitalized and meet or exceed local regulatory capital requirements. The companies continue to operate in the normal course to meet obligations to policyholders. In particular, AIG noted its long tradition of service in Asian markets, which are key to AIGs future growth. Founded in Shanghai in 1919, Asia is home to some of AIGs oldest and most valued clients.                              They don&amp;#039;t mention PCG by name, but we&amp;#039;re the healthiest of them all (subsidiaries).
