 BAK Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Re: AIG:  MKS &amp;amp; XFP from insurance subsidiary (I think)    &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt; I guess the ultimate question is what is an insurance company worth in  BK court.. Obviously they cannot write new insurance policy and  probably has to wind down the current policy holder (??). They can sell  all the asset of the company. But they won&amp;#039;t be able to hold their  people or clients.&amp;amp;nbsp; What exactly is left when an insurance company go  BK? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;       I don&amp;#039;t think the problems are in the insurance companies.&amp;amp;nbsp; They rake in $20 bn a year, and are in good enough shape to upstream $20 bn to the AIG holding.&amp;amp;nbsp; The problem is that AIG guarantees all its subsidiaries, and the financial services subsidiary has blown up.&amp;amp;nbsp; I wonder if (no, I hope that) the insurance subsidiaries are bankruptcy remote from AIG.&amp;amp;nbsp; If AIG goes broke, the insurance companies should continue to function and will be sold off to someone.
