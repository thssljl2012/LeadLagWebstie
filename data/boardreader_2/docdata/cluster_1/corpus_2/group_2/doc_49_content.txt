AIG isn&amp;#039;t just a financial institution, but it is also a HUGE insurance company, which in many cases, is a requirement of the common person to have.       So, if I&amp;#039;m not mistaken on the insurance side of things (and this could be the 20% that the government is not taking over since certain types of insurance cannot be federally regulated), AIG will be having financial issues and will rely on other big insurance companies to contribue and help them get back on their feet as much as possible with that portion.      More than likely, one of the other companies would just buy out what&amp;#039;s left of AIG Insurance and use their own guidelines and practices to run things instead.      A lot of insurance companies are having troubl right now, especially with employment. Many have had mass lay-offs, and others are on hiring freezes. There are a rare few out there who are still hiring, which means that they are doing well and continue to grow...but eventually things have to come to a stop as long as the economy continues to go into a downward spiral.
