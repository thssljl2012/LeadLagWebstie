             Quote:           Fitch Cuts AIG Ratings    By KATHY SHWIFF    September 15, 2008 7:11 p.m.        Fitch Ratings cut its credit ratings on American International Group Inc., saying the insurer&amp;#039;s financial flexibility and ability to raise cash is &amp;quot;extremely limited&amp;quot; because of recent declines in the stock price, widening credit spreads and difficult capital market conditions.        Fitch lowered the insurance giant&amp;#039;s long-term insurer debt and senior unsecured debt ratings two notches. The rating agency also warned of possible further downgrades.        Fitch noted New York state&amp;#039;s agreement to relax insurance regulations so AIG can access up to $20 billion in assets held by its subsidiaries. But the firm said AIG&amp;#039;s ability to fund collateral requirements and replace capital lost because of exposure to the U.S. residential mortgage market only will come from its subsidiaries or from asset sales.        &amp;quot;Given current difficult market conditions, Fitch believes that AIG is likely to face additional material collateral calls on this portfolio,&amp;quot; Fitch said.
