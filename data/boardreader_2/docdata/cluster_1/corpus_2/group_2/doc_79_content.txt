The Fed couldn&amp;#039;t decide if it was a security or a commodity. In the end, it went unregulated by anyone. The NY Insurance Commissioner announced last week they would regulate CDS as insurance. Suddenly, Congress goes ape-sheep over Federal oversight and starts talking about Federal insurance charters.   Don&amp;#039;t be misled. AIG&amp;#039;s insurance subsidiaries (who are regulated at the state level) are financially sound and the AIG parent, not subject to any oversight, is in trouble. Just goes to show the states accomplish what the Fed can&amp;#039;t do. And now the Fed want&amp;#039;s to wrest control and regulation away from the states. When that happens, how responsive do you think the Fed regulators will be to Kimo in Hawaii who has a problem with his auto claim? Take a number and stand behind the yellow line!!!
