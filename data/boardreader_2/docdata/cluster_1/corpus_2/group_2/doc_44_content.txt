The authors are missing the inconvenient fact against their thesis, that the insurance entities under the AIG umbrella are very sound financially because of the current oversight by the states and the NAIC (National Associations of Insurance Commissioners).        They state, &amp;amp;quot;Unless Congress provides an alternative to the state-based regulatory model, it is likely that the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) will be forced to pay for more bailouts in the future.&amp;amp;quot;  But this just doesn&amp;#039;t add up when you take a closer look at AIG.        It is only non-insurance entities that have caused AIG problems.  Most of these entities are regulated on the federal level.  For example the finance company of AIG is regulated by federal lending laws.  Another example is the SEC regulates the exotic securities (CDO&amp;#039;s &amp;amp;amp; CDS&amp;#039;s) which are part of AIG&amp;#039;s trouble.  As well the SEC does regulate stock companies too which is what AIG is.   There is a pattern to see in the AIG picture, those entities that are regulated by the feds are giving AIG the grief.        With this kind of success rate maybe we should not ask the feds to rescue AIG.        The authors do have a point that it would be easier for insurance companies to do business if the individual states would be more similar in their regulations but at least they are making progress in that area with combined product filing and attempting to use NAIC model regulations to bring some uniformity.        The success of the insurance entities at remaining solvent has to do with being forced by regulation to be good risk managers.  To manage risk well you need good analysts.  In the insurance world those analysts are called actuaries.        We just read in this paper yesterday that the current problems on Wall street has something to do with not having enough analysts in the business of risk assessment.        The nerds are needed after all.  Maybe the best thing the feds could do for the future of the investment world would be to force better risk management.  Yes good risk management will require risk managers--the investment analysts.        Truly,    Daniel Remboldt
