   American International Group   should not expect bridge financing from the Federal Reserve and should be &amp;quot;assessing all their private market options,&amp;quot; sources told CNBC.AIG, which is seeking a bridge loan of up $40 billion from the Federal Reserve, made an unprecedented approach to the Federal Reserve seeking short-term financing on Sunday, according to media reports.              The Fed normally oversees monetary policy and supervision of banks. AIG was seeking the funds as a temporary measure and planned to repay the Fed with the proceeds from asset sales.   Meanwhile, New York State will allow AIG to use $20 billion of assets held by its subsidiaries to provide cash needed for the troubled insurer to stay in business, Gov. David Paterson said.  Paterson asked New York state insurance regulators to essentially allow AIG to provide a bridge loan to itself.  The governor has also asked the head of New York&amp;#039;s insurance department to talk with Federal regulators about providing an additional bridge loan to AIG. &amp;quot;AIG still remains financially sound,&amp;quot; Paterson said.  The move will allow AIG to use those assets as collateral to borrow cash to fund its day-to-day operations, Paterson explained.  AIG has been battered over the past year by billions of dollars of losses tied to deterioration in the mortgage and credit markets.     http://www.cnbc.com/id/26718923
