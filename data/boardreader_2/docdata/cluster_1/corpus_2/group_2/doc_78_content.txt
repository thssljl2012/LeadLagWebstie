                               That is the stupidest, most irresponsible comment I have ever seen.    The Federal Reserve has NOTHING to do with the regulation or solvency of insurance companies.  Insurance companies, ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES, are regulated by STATE insurance departments, not any agency of the Federal Government.  State Guaranty Funds protect the solvency of insurance companies, not the Feds.  Don&amp;#039;t feel left out, one of the presidential candidates doesn&amp;#039;t realize this either....the younger one, with less experience.  He has made statements that clearly indicates that he doesn&amp;#039;t know who regulates insurance companies.  Pay your premium to AIG and sleep well at night, the AIG insurance companies are solvent and solid.
