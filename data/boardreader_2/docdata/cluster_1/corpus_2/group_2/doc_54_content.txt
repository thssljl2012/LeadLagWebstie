On first look this item sounds good. If you look at the front page of Investors Business Daily today you find out the government had no choice but to give a loan to AIG. Why? Isn&amp;#039;t AIG just a Life Insurance Company? No. AIG insured those risky mortgage backed securities of sub prime loans. AIG sold insurance on commercial bonds on companies like Fannie and Fred plus Lehman Brothers that all became valued at zero. They sold the insurance in this country and overseas. The insurance allowed banks to hold fewer assets and meet Federal requirements to give loans. If AIG could not pay the insurance, bank loses would create a credit crunch that would bring this country to a standstill and likely no loans could be issued. You could have listened to CNBC all day and not understood until IBD wrote today&amp;#039;s item. Maybe the Sentinel needs to write items on just what it understands - Daisy Lynum and her son Juan. Where is Juan&amp;#039;s father?
