  The problem with an annuity from a mutual fund is that they are usually variable. You get what you make. When you get old you don&amp;#039;t want that. You want a reliable income. But of course &amp;#039;reliable&amp;#039; has a relative meaning. The agentsDO get a horrendous fee for selling the policy and if most people knew what the fee was they wouldn&amp;#039;t buy the policy. That money comes from you.       As for just why AIG is in trouble:  http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/uncle-sam-blinks-steps-bail/story.aspx?guid=%7B7060429A-C32D-455F-8FD7-91E24EDD3B83%7D&amp;amp;amp;dist=msr_21    i.e. it sold insurance on mortgage related securities.    &amp;quot;AIG has been hammered by derivatives exposure to the housing bust and mortgage meltdown.      The insurer has been hit hard by the housing crisis and credit crunch because its derivatives unit sold guarantees on mortgage-related securities known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, using credit-default swaps.      As house prices fall and the credit crunch deepens, the market for these CDO exposures is disappearing, forcing AIG to report big write-downs.      AIG reported a quarterly net loss of more than $5 billion in August as it wrote down these exposures and suffered impairments on some of its mortgage-related investments.  &amp;quot;   To what degree has AZ done the same thing? Well we don&amp;#039;t know because they aren&amp;#039;t in the spotlight like AIG. But they ARE in the exact same business as AIG. Will they fail too? No indication of that but they are hurting like everybody else.    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;amp;sid=agKr1y4Nb2Ao&amp;amp;amp;refer=home    I think they&amp;#039;ve gotten rid of that bank.
