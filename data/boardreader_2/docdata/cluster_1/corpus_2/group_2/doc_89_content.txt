 After reading the WSJ piece on AIG (unless I&amp;#039;m missing something), it appears AIG derives little of its operational income from the insurance business.   It is true that the only portion of AIG&amp;#039;s business that is in the tank is their reinsurance business related to the sub-prime mortgage pyramid scheme.  While that is apparently a relatively small piece of their total worth, the problem as I see it is that AIG has jeapordized all of it&amp;#039;s subsidiaries as well.  Here&amp;#039;s a link to the Federal Reserve Board Press Release that substantiates my opinion:  http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080916a.htm   From that Press Release:  The interests of taxpayers are protected by key terms of the loan.  The loan is collateralized by all the assets  of AIG, and of its primary non-regulated subsidiaries.  These assets include the stock of substantially all of the regulated subsidiaries.  The loan is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the firms assets.  The U.S. government will receive a 79.9 percent equity interest in AIG and has the right to veto the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders.    So, the way I see it, the stockholders are shafted as well as the taxpayers.
