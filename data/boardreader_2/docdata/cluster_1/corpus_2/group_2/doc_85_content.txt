According to AIG&amp;#039;s prospectus for their $6.5 billion equity unit offering (AIG-A), they had no outstanding preferred shares as of May 12, 2008.      &amp;quot;As of the date of this prospectus, neither AIG nor AIGPF has any preferred stock outstanding.&amp;quot;      Kind of confusing because they do have exchange traded junior debentures (AVF and AFF). But the Fed statement only stipulates the right to veto dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders.&amp;amp;nbsp; I&amp;#039;m assuming that the statement applies to preferred stock issuance in the future.      AVF and AFF are interest payments.&amp;amp;nbsp; They don&amp;#039;t qualify for the 15% tax rate.&amp;amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#039;t see why given the wording of the Fed statement these junior debt securities would not receive their interest payments.            thread start
