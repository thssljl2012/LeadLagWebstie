(AIG) What the AIG Bailout Means for You   By Kimberly Lankford   September 17, 2008      (AIG) My husband and I hold life insurance policies with American  International Group (AIG), which the government just bailed out so  it wouldn&amp;#039;t fail. How can I tell whether the company would be in a  position to pay out on my policies?         AIG&amp;#039;s financial turmoil has been a big concern to many Kiplinger  readers -- especially because it has offered some of the lowest  term insurance rates for the past few years, and the company  underwrites the popular Vanguard immediate annuity. The bottom line  for these customers: AIG&amp;#039;s insurance subsidiaries do have assets  available to pay claims, and there are several layers of protection  for policyholders.      AIG has several different businesses, and only some of them deal  with insurance. Those insurance subsidiaries are subject to  different rules from the rest of the company. The state insurance  departments set strict capital requirements to make sure insurers  can pay claims. As a result, those subsidiaries are not suffering  from the same financial troubles as other parts of the company.      &amp;quot;The insurance subsidiaries are solvent and able to pay their  obligations,&amp;quot; says Sandy Praeger, president of the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners. &amp;quot;In fact, it will likely be  the insurance subsidiaries &amp;amp;#8211;--or their valuable blocks of  business and high-quality assets -- that will be sold in an attempt  to return the AIG parent to a more stable financial  position.&amp;amp;#8221;      For the annuities, the AIG life insurance companies hold  substantial assets to back their payment obligations to the  Vanguard Lifetime Income Plan fixed annuity contracts, including  those indexed to inflation measures, according to Vanguard. And the  assets in the Vanguard variable immediate annuities are held in  separate accounts that are invested in Vanguard mutual funds and  wouldn&amp;#039;t be affected by the insurer&amp;#039;s financial situation.      If the insurance businesses are sold, then the insurance benefits  and annuity payouts should continue to be paid by the new insurer  without any disruption.      If the insurance subsidiaries did end up having financial troubles,  then the insurance department in the company&amp;#039;s home state (New York  for many of AIG&amp;#039;s insurance subsidiaries) would try to rehabilitate  the company. If that didn&amp;#039;t work and the company became insolvent,  then the state guaranty associations would protect policyholders by  continuing the insurance policies and paying claims, up to certain  limits.      The maximum limits on protection vary based on the policyholder&amp;#039;s  state, but every guaranty association must provide coverage for at  least $300,000 in life insurance death benefits (per insured life),  $100,000 in cash surrender or withdrawal value for life insurance,  $100,000 in withdrawal and cash values for annuities, and $100,000  in health insurance policy benefits. Also, &amp;quot;immediate annuity  payouts are continued without a break,&amp;quot; says Peter Gallanis,  president of the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance  Guaranty Associations.      Policyholders often receive even more than the guaranty association  limits because policyholder claims are given priority over other  creditors. &amp;quot;That has happened in a number of cases where either the  assets available in the failed company are relatively high compared  with the liabilities, or where there&amp;#039;s been exceptionally good  handling of the estate in the receivership process,&amp;quot; says Gallanis.

If a financially strong insurer ends up buying AIG&amp;#039;s insurance  subsidiaries, your claims could be paid seamlessly. If you&amp;#039;re still  thinking about switching to another company that isn&amp;#039;t in financial  trouble, be careful: If you&amp;#039;ve held a life insurance policy with  AIG for several years, buying new coverage now could be a lot more  expensive because you&amp;#039;re older. And you could get stuck with a  penalty for switching out of an annuity.
