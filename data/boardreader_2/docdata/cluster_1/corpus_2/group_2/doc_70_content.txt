Before you phone DAN, I just did - and they assured me that I&amp;#039;ll be covered okay, but I&amp;#039;m not business savy enough to understand.  Someone want to explain to me how they can guarantee payments from a insurance written by AIG if it goes into bankruptcy...?     thanks                       Good question. If AIG goes bankrupt, I&amp;#039;d suggest not getting bent.    Do we have any insurance lawyers hanging around who would like to chime in?    Terry
