You noted that:       XFP -- underlying securities issued by &amp;quot;American General Institutional Capital A&amp;quot;   MKS -- underlying securities issued by &amp;quot;American General Institutional Capital A&amp;quot;      So MKS &amp;amp;amp; XFP are supported by debt issued by an insurance holdco/subsidiary of AIG.         This is good, right? As opposed to the finance arm which has the exposure to the toxic stuff?      I&amp;#039;ve stayed out of this mess so far; thinking about XFP though...      Thanks,   TB            thread start
