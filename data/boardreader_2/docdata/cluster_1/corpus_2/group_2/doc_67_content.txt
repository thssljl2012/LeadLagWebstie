Personally, I think that they are done for.                           I feel your pain Mike. I got a 5 million verdict against Mellon Bank who could obviously handle the amount. Their excess carrier went bankrupt. The underlying carrier Chubb only had 1 mill coverage. I had to chase them quite a while until my client got paid.  It&amp;#039;s sad, because AIG&amp;#039;s insurance business is very sound. It&amp;#039;s the monoline biz dragging down the whole entity.     I wonder how the NY Insurance Guarantee Fund will handle AIG&amp;#039;s Life Insurance Policies if they do fail.
