   I know several people who have a lot of money in AIG. Some people have said the reason the government is bailing them out, is too many politicians have money in AIG.    Gotta love it...LOL, I think I heard the same thing...       My LTC is with Mutual Of Omaha    Find out what their exposure is. Considering the seriousness of this crisis, they may have information on their web site.      Here is a summation of the AIG problem:      The big brokerage firms bought the loans from the banks, and packaged them into pools. They then split the pools into pieces (&amp;amp;#8220;tranches&amp;amp;#8221; in Wall Street parlance) and sold each tranche to investors. Pension funds, endowments, hedge funds and mutual funds scarfed them up.       Some of the pools held low-risk loans; these consisted of borrowers who made 20% down payments on traditional 30-year 6% fixed-rate mortgages. But other tranches consisted of the new &amp;amp;#8220;subprime&amp;amp;#8221; or &amp;amp;#8220;Alt-A&amp;amp;#8221; mortgages &amp;amp;#8211; obtained by borrowers who managed to borrow more than the house was worth, paying less than the monthly payment and with little or no assets or income that might enable them to keep doing so. But on paper, the loans were profitable, and Wall Street found them easy to sell to investors eager for the high returns that had been eluding them since the dot-com bubble had burst in 2000. And to give the illusion of safety, firms creating these securities had them insured.    Enter AIG and other insurance companies. In exchange for a premium, AIG agreed to guarantee these investments in one way or another. Now, with Lehman&amp;amp;#8217;s collapse, it appears that those promises might need to be honored. There are fears that AIG might not be able to pay all those claims.
