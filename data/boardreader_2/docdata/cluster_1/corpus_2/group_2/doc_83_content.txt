           Advertisements [ ? ]                         They are desperately trying to avoid having their stock rating downgraded.   SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- American International Group Inc. lost more than 60% of its market value Monday as the giant insurer rushed to raise capital and stave off ratings downgrades that could threaten its survival.    ...  AIG is rushing to try to raise capital to avoid ratings downgrades. If downgrades happen, the insurer may have to post billions of dollars in collateral to support credit-derivatives positions. The downgrades also may trigger an exodus of clients, with some customers canceling policies. That may require AIG to return any unearned premiums covering the rest of 2008.  &amp;quot;What&amp;#039;s really needed is a significant amount of external capital as quickly as possible,&amp;quot; said Sean Egan, president of Egan-Jones Ratings, a ratings agency that&amp;#039;s paid by investors rather than issuers. &amp;quot;The most likely avenue for that is the sale of some of AIG&amp;#039;s operating units to another insurance firm.&amp;quot;  If AIG can arrange short-term financing of at least $25 billion, that would probably give the insurer enough time to sell businesses and raise the capital it needs to avoid downgrades, Egan explained.   Shares of AIG slumped 61% to close at $4.76. Spreads on AIG credit-default swaps widened by 1,000 basis points to 1,908 during afternoon action, according to Credit Default Research. That suggests traders are a lot more worried about an AIG default.     http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/aig-slumps-insure...                         ...
