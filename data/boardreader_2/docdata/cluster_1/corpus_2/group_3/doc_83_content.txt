At the hearing, a recent business event held by an AIG subsidiary was mischaracterized as an Executive Retreat held right after receiving the $85 billion loan credit facility from the New York Fed. The event in question was held by one of AIGs insurance subsidiaries for independent life insurance agents  not for AIG employees  who were top business producers for the company.         The vast majority of the attendees were independent business people and their guests, not AIG employees. Indeed, of the more than 100 attendees, only 10 were employees of one of our insurance subsidiaries who attended to represent their company. Not a single corporate executive from AIG headquarters attended.&amp;amp;quot;
