           Advertisements [ ? ]                         This is where your money went:  Key AIG stockholder and former AIG CEO Maurice &amp;quot;Hank&amp;quot; Greenberg is currently chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr and Company, a diversified financial services firm that is named for the founder of AIG, Cornelius Vander Starr. Hank Greenberg&amp;#039;s sons (see below) Jeffrey Wayne Greenberg and Evan G. Greenberg are also key AIG stockholders.  Maurice &amp;quot;Hank&amp;quot; Greenberg shifted the AIG&amp;#039;s focus from personal insurance to high-margin corporate coverage. Greenberg focused on selling insurance through independent brokers rather than agents to avoid selling insurance at prices which occasionally became too low (to cover the future payouts) given marketplace competition. In the mid-2000s AIG became embroiled in a series of fraud investigations conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Justice Department, and New York State Attorney General&amp;#039;s Office. Greenberg was ousted amid an accounting scandal in February 2005. The New York Attorney General&amp;#039;s investigation led to a $1.6 billion fine for AIG and criminal charges for some of its executives  Greenberg was both a social friend and client of Henry Kissinger, utilising his consultancy, Kissinger Associates, for advice and operations in a number of countries, particularly in Asia. In 1987 he appointed Kissinger as chairman of AIG&amp;#039;s International Advisory Board.  Son Jeffrey Wayne Greenberg began his career at Marsh &amp;amp; McLennan after graduation. Greenberg resigned as CEO of Marsh &amp;amp; McLennan after the firm was charged with rigging, and as part of a lucrative kick-back scheme, &amp;quot;stifling competition&amp;quot; according to New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. He is currently chairman of the privaty equity firm he founded, Aquiline (Validus) Holdings registered in Bermuda.  http://www.secinfo.com/d14sr8.u1aWk.htm   Jeffrey Wayne Greenberg is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, serves as a trustee of the Brookings Institution, and has served as a member of Brown University&amp;#039;s corporation.
