I cannot help it if you lack basic reading comprehension skills to recognized when someone moves from a direct quote to another paragraph.  Man you are a retard....direct from the site:           Quote:                         Does the Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s $85 billion bail-out of insurance giant AIG constitute nationalization? According to the Fed&amp;#039;s official statement, the answer is &amp;amp;quot;no.&amp;amp;quot; But that could just be because Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act only allows the Fed to make loans, not own companies. The Fed used this Act to allow it to provide a two-year loan to AIG to prevent bankruptcy, which the Fed said &amp;amp;quot;could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility...&amp;amp;quot;       In return, the government gets 79.9% of AIG&amp;#039;s equity. It also gets to replace management (which it already has) and has veto power over all important decisions, including asset sales and payment of dividends.      The plan is to break up AIG and sell off the pieces to repay the loan. If the plan works, the loan will be repaid through sales of the assets. If the plan works really well, then the stock price will go up.                     Oh, and I like the part where she says &amp;amp;quot;the plan&amp;amp;quot; is to break up AIG like she knew wtf she was talking about.  AIG is not breaking up, it is just simply selling off some divisions, which happens all the time in business.  I read her bio, sounds like she spent to much time in the &amp;amp;quot;classroom&amp;amp;quot; reading books instead of reading real world material:       AIG to repay US government after asset sale - Yahoo! News       Looks like the &amp;amp;quot;credentialed&amp;amp;quot; person jumped the gun and made an assumption that she had no idea about in the first place and now proven wrong.  Oh, and btw, with all those credentials, all she could get were government jobs?  Seriously, get someone from the financial sector who &amp;amp;quot;made it&amp;amp;quot; and did not ride the tech boom of the 90s and listen to them...      Meanwhile, while she was writing that article posted on September 17th, I read the real world material and went all in on AIG September 18th at $2.27.....       GBJJ, we are talking about 2 &amp;amp;quot;loans&amp;amp;quot; here.  The one that will allow AIG to buy other companies is the second one at $35 billion.  AIG has many options now with that one secured and not tied to any specific stipulations.  The link above discusses Libby&amp;#039;s plan on what will be sold to repay and what will be kept, but the company itself is not going anywhere.  With $1 trillion in assets, even if the company is 25% smaller, especially now with the second loan&amp;amp;quot; that AIG now has, that is still a $750 billion dollar company trading at $3.50 a share right now.  Even if AIG is only 50% the size, it is still a $500 billion dollar company.        AIG will have the loan repayed very soon, the bad underwriting on derivitives will be transfered to the government via the $700 billion bail-out, I see CHACHING CHACHING CHACHING.  At my entry point, all AIG has to do is get to $7 and I made ~300%.
