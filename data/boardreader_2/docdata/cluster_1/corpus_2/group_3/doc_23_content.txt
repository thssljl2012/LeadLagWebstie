   What kind of gaggle of retahds are these j.erks? They should be thrown in jail and tried as criminals!!!  &amp;amp;quot;AIG executives spent $500,000 at an exclusive resort just days after the U.S. government agreed to spend $85 billion to protect the giant insurer from collapse, according to Rep. Henry Waxman, the California Democrat who chairs the House Oversight Committee.  Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., described what investigators found during a hearing this morning on Capitol Hill:      After the bailout of AIG last month, the United States government effectively bought an 80% share in the company. That should have caused a fundamental change, you would think, in how the company was spending funds on compensation, bonuses and benefits.      But it doesn&amp;#039;t look like that&amp;#039;s what happened. The committee learned that shortly after the bailout went through, executives from AIG&amp;#039;s major U.S. life insurance subsidiary, AIG American General, held a week-long conference at an exclusive resort in California.      The resort is called the St. Regis Monarch Beach. ... It&amp;#039;s very impressive. This is an exclusive resort. The rooms start, gentlemen, at $425 a night. Some are more than $1,200 a night.      ... We contacted the resort where AIG held this week-long event, and we requested copies of AIG&amp;#039;s bills. We learned that AIG spent nearly $500,000 in a single week at the -- at this hotel. Now, this was right after the bailout.      ... Let me describe some of the -- the charges that -- that the shareholders who are now U.S. taxpayers had to pay. Check this out.      AIG spent $200,000 for hotel rooms, and almost $150,000 for catered banquets. AIG spent -- listen to this one -- $23,000 at the hotel spa and another $1,400 at the salon. They were getting their manicures, their facials, their pedicures and their massages while the American people were -- were footing the bill.      And they spent another $10,000 for -- I don&amp;#039;t know what this is -- leisure dining.&amp;amp;quot;
