               Quote       Now that AIG has been nationalized, some folks are wondering just how their tax dollars are being spent. If you&amp;#039;re among them, we have some bad news for you from ABC. They are reporting that papers uncovered by congressional investigators show that &amp;amp;quot;less than a week after the federal government committed &amp;amp;#036;85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California.&amp;amp;quot; Ouch.  ABC says that the documents show that the company, yes the company, paid more than &amp;amp;#036;400,000 for a week long retreat at the resort. The bill included &amp;amp;#036;200,000 for rooms, &amp;amp;#036;150,000 for meals and &amp;amp;#036;23,000 in spa charges.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).  AIG&amp;#039;s former CEO told Congress today that AIG was a victim of a &amp;amp;quot;crisis in confidence&amp;amp;quot; and an &amp;amp;quot;unprecedented global catastrophe,&amp;amp;quot; but records show that there were serious concerns about the way the company was being managed.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;In March, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision wrote AIG, &amp;amp;quot;We are concerned that the corporate oversight of AIG Financial Productslacks critical elements of independence, transparency, and granularity.&amp;amp;quot;  Congressman Waxman also said that there was evidence that the former CEO changed the bonus schedule in order to insure that top executives would continue making multi-million dollar salaries, even as their company went broke.  &amp;amp;quot;Mr. Sullivan and the other top executives should have had their bonuses slashed due to poor performance,&amp;amp;quot; said Waxman.  Sullivan received a &amp;amp;#036;15 million golden parachute payment when he was let go in June, says ABC.
