When the company (at large) is failing (at large) you don&amp;#039;t separate the profits from one division and treat it differently than the losses of another division.  This is still money that AIG did not have to spend, which was then subsidized with tax payer money.  When a company&amp;#039;s profits dry up the first things that should be dissolved are the &amp;amp;quot;perks.&amp;amp;quot;
