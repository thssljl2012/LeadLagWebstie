 Less than a week after the federal government offered an $85 billion bailout to insurance giant AIG, the company held a week-long retreat for its executives at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., running up a tab of $440,000, Rep.  Henry Waxman  (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant.   Showing a photograph of the resort, Waxman said the executives spent $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa.        http://voices.washingtonpost.com/livecoverage/2008/10/after_bailout_aig_executives_h.html?nav=rss_email/components
