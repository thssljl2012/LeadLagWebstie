 October 7th, 2008           Quote:                         AIG, once the world&amp;amp;#8217;s largest insurer, disputed Waxman&amp;amp;#8217;s characterization of the conference. Spokesman Nicholas Ashooh said the event had been scheduled a year earlier by AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s American General life insurance subsidiary as a way to reward independent agents who sell the company&amp;amp;#8217;s products.    &amp;amp;#8220;This is very standard in the industry to reward the top 5 to 10 percent of top sellers,&amp;amp;#8221; he said. &amp;amp;#8220;In the insurance business, it&amp;amp;#8217;s as basic as salary as a means to reward performance. It was not AIG executives running away to California.&amp;amp;#8221;                        AIG American General spent:         * $147,302 for banquets      * $139,375 on rooms      * $23,380 for spa services      * $6,939 for golf      * $5,016 at the Stonehill Tavern      * $3,065 for in-room dining and the lobby lounge      * $2,949 for gratuities      * $1,901 at the Monarch Bayclub      * and $1,488 at the resort&amp;amp;#8217;s Vogue Salon    The Bloomberg wire service quoted Waxman as saying, &amp;amp;#8220;Average Americans are suffering economically Yet  less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG , company executives could be found  wining and dining  at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation.&amp;amp;#8221;    I heard about this on the radio tonight.
