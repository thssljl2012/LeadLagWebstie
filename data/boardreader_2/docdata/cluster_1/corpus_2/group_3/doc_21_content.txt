Only idiots wouldn&amp;#039;t have canceled that trip under the current financial crisis of AIG.     AIG&amp;#039;s holding company may have been in trouble, but its insurance subsidiaries have plenty of assets to back the insurance policies. If the taxpayers want the loan to AIG to be repaid, AIG&amp;#039;s insurance companies will have to keep selling insurance. That means keeping the agents happy (as well as the policyowners).  Despite the troubles of the AIG holding company, all the AIG insurance companies are solid. To repay the loan, the life companies (American General, SunAmerica, VALIC, and ALICO) are all likely to be sold. To get a solid offer, each of these insurers must continue to be a going concern.  Let&amp;#039;s not kill the goose before it returns our golden egg.
