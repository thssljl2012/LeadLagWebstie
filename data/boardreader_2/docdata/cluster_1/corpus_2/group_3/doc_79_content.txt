         Congress scolds former AIG executives over crisis       By ANDREW TAYLOR,    Associated Press Writer   48 minutes ago             Executives at American International Group Inc. hid the full range of its risky financial products from auditors as losses mounted, according to documents released Tuesday by a congressional panel examining the chain of events that forced the government to bail out the conglomerate.      The panel sharply criticized AIG&amp;#039;s former top executives, who cast blame on each other for the company&amp;#039;s financial woes.      &amp;amp;quot;You have cost my constituents and the taxpayers of this country $85 billion and run into the ground one of the most respected insurance companies in the history of our country,&amp;amp;quot; said Rep.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., unveiled documents showing AIG executives hid the full extent of the firm&amp;#039;s risky financial products from auditors, both outside and inside the firm, as losses mounted.      For instance, federal regulators at the Office of Thrift Supervision warned in March that &amp;amp;quot;corporate oversight of AIG Financial Products ... lack critical elements of independence.&amp;amp;quot; At the same time, Pricewaterhouse Cooper confidentially warned the company that the &amp;amp;quot;root cause&amp;amp;quot; of its mounting problems was denying internal overseers in charge of limiting AIG&amp;#039;s exposure access to what was going on in its highly leveraged financial products branch.      Waxman also released testimony from former AIG auditor Joseph St. Denis, who resigned after being blocked from giving his input on how the firm estimated its liabilities.      Three former AIG executives were summoned to appear before the hearing. One of them, Maurice &amp;amp;quot;Hank&amp;amp;quot; Greenberg
