Seriously, its time to start shooting these people. Trials are expensive.                         Yeah, I heard about this today.  This is seriously fucked up.  Kinda reminds me of the $2000.00 debit cards the Katrina refugees got to help them get back on their feet, and many of them blew it on coke and hookers.      I&amp;#039;m glad to see my tax money is being put to good use.
