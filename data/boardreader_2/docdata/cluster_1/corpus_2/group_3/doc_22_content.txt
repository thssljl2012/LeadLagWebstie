If the taxpayers want the loan to AIG to be repaid, AIG&amp;#039;s insurance companies will have to keep selling insurance. That means keeping the agents happy (as well as the policyowners). Despite the troubles of the AIG holding company, all the AIG insurance companies are solid. To repay the loan, the life companies (American General, SunAmerica, VALIC, and ALICO) are all likely to be sold. To get a solid offer, each of these insurers must continue to be a going concern. Let&amp;#039;s not kill the goose before it returns our golden egg.     You are absolutely right,,,,but they should at least be making an effort, how ever so slight, to be working to that point of showing the taxpayer a recovery path towards accountability. Not spa treatments. Hell, I&amp;#039;m sure this wasn&amp;#039;t the first time they have done this. And no, I really don&amp;#039;t think they deserved it because they were &amp;amp;quot;stressed out&amp;amp;quot; as one spokesman said.
