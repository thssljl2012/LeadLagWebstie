The event was scheduled months ago and hosted by one of AIG&amp;#039;s life insurance companies for INDEPENDENT LIFE INSURANCE AGENTS, NOT FOR AIG EMPLOYEES. There were zero AIG Corporate executives in attendance. There were more than 100 attendees and only 10 of these were AIG employees who attended to represent their company. These Independent life insurance agents were not AIG employees, but this retreat was a reward to the top independent sales agents.     you sound like AIG&amp;#039;s press agent; a &amp;amp;quot;close friend?&amp;amp;quot; This is the same story AIG floated out after this story broke almost word for word
