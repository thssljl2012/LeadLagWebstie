Tax money didn&amp;#039;t pay for it. The AIG insurance division profits paid for it. Just because the parent company got a bailout doesn&amp;#039;t mean that AIG insurance is in the wrong. They are a separate business, with separate bank accounts, financial statements, and budgets. They did not use earmarked tax payer money for this. The used AIG insurance profits.    Would you say Comedy Central shouldn&amp;#039;t reward it&amp;#039;s employees if the channel is profitable, but Viacom isn&amp;#039;t? Viacom is responsible for managing it&amp;#039;s subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are separate entities and should not be held responsible for the parent company&amp;#039;s wrongdoings.
