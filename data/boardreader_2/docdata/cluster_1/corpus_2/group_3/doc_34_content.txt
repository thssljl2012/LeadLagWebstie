  These GOPers of AIG truly live in another world, with their, &amp;#039;Let them eat cake&amp;#039; attitude!   Guess they had so much fun at the first party, on the Taxpayers dime, they just had to try sneaking in another!......          Outrage Leads AIG To Cancel Second Luxury Retreat       Ritz Carlton Event was Booked for Next Week      By  JOSEPH RHEE    October 9, 2008       Battered by outrage over the $440,000 it spent on a luxury retreat less than a week after the federal government loaned it $85 billion dollars, the giant AIG Insurance Company says it has called off plans to hold a second retreat next week at the exclusive Ritz-Carlton Resort in Half Moon Bay, California.          The Ritz-Carlton outing, like the earlier one, was to reward top independent insurance agents, which the company called a &amp;amp;quot;standard industry practice.&amp;amp;quot;          &amp;amp;quot;I am somewhat relieved to hear that AIG has canceled their Ritz-Carlton conference, which was nothing less than a slap in the face of the American people,&amp;amp;quot; said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD). &amp;amp;quot;I cannot fathom how in the same day&amp;amp;#8212;the very same day&amp;amp;#8212;that AIG asked the government for another $37.8 billion loan, the company would even consider moving forward with plans to host another large conference at another luxury resort.&amp;amp;quot;
