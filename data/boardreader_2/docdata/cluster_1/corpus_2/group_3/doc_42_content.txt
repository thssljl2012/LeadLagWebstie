 After The Bailout AIG Bought Themselves A $440,000 &amp;amp;quot;Retreat&amp;amp;quot; At A California ResortNow that AIG has been nationalized, some folks are wondering just how their tax dollars are being spent. If you&amp;#039;re among them, we have some bad news for you from ABC. They are reporting that papers uncovered by congressional investigators show that &amp;amp;quot;less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California.&amp;amp;quot; Ouch.      ABC says that the documents show that the company, yes the company, paid more than $400,000 for a week long retreat at the resort. The bill included $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.       &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).
