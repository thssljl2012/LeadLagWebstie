 http://voices.washingtonpost.com/liv...l?hpid=topnews    After Bailout, AIG Executives Head to Resort       UPDATED: 11:31 a.m.   Less than a week after the federal government offered an $85 billion bailout to insurance giant AIG, the company held a week-long retreat for its executives at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., running up a tab of $440,000, Rep.  Henry Waxman  (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant.   Showing a photograph of the resort, Waxman said the executives spent $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa.   &amp;amp;quot;Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation,&amp;amp;quot; Waxman said. &amp;amp;quot;We will ask whether any of this makes sense. &amp;amp;quot;   After reading this I am almost too angry to respond.  What can be done about this greed and disregard for what we will all be paying for?
