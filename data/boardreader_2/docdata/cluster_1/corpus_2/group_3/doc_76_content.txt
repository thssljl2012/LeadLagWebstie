John McCain&amp;#039;s campaign likes to tell us that they want to lower taxes for &amp;amp;quot;Joe Six Pack&amp;amp;quot;.....Who?         Well it turns out it&amp;#039;s not who you think it is.  It&amp;#039;s folks like Joe Cassano, (see story below) the man many people think caused the recent collapse of AIG. The insurance giant that was recently bailed out with $75 billion of taxpayer money.  (They recently came back asking for another $38 billion)      John McCain thinks people like Joe Cassano pay too much in taxes and he wants to make the Bush tax cuts for America&amp;#039;s richest families permanent.  Barack Obama would allow the tax cuts for families making over $250,000 per year to expire, allowing their maximum tax rate to go from 35% back to 39%.        In contrast John McCain has proposed taxing the insurance benefits for ordinary working Americans for the first time in history, to pay for Mr. Cassano&amp;#039;s tax break.          McCain also wants to lower the taxes Mr. Cassano pays on capital gains and eliminate the inheritance taxes Mr. Cassano&amp;#039;s heirs might one day have to pay.      Personally, I don&amp;#039;t have a problem with Mr. Cassano paying a few dollars more in taxes.  I don&amp;#039;t have a problem with that at all.           Quote:                          Joe Cassano: The Man Who Brought Down AIG?    Moments ago, members of the House oversight committee concluded their hammering of the two most recent AIG chief executives.       Topic: Joe Cassano, the man who some credit with bringing down the insurance giant.      Cassano was president of AIG&amp;#039;s financial products division, which trafficked in the credit-default swaps, or CDS, which we learned earlier proved so dangerous.      Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) angrily recited the tale of Cassano&amp;#039;s tape: He  earned $280 million in cash  -- more than AIG chief executives -- and for every dollar his financial products unit made, 30 cents came back to Cassano and other top execs.       After the unit lost $11 billion, Cassano was fired Feb. 29 of this year, Braley pointed out, and got to keep $34 million in bonuses and was kept on as an AIG consultant at a salary of  $1 million per month        Braley asked the witnesses, former AIG chief executives Michael Sullivan and Robert    Willumstad, if they had exercised their authority to fire Cassano from his consultant&amp;#039;s role, given all the damage he had brought to AIG.      &amp;amp;quot;No,&amp;amp;quot; both said.      Then oversight committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) really lit into them.      Asked why they didn&amp;#039;t fire Cassano, Sullivan said they needed to &amp;amp;quot;retain the 20-year knowledge of the transactions.&amp;amp;quot;       http://voices.washingtonpost.com/liv...l?hpid=topnews
