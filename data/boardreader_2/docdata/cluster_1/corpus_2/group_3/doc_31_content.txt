       CEOs: (From left) Robert Willumstad (July 2008-September 2008), Martin Sullivan (2005-2008), Maurice (Hank) Greenberg (1968-2005)  Company: American International Group (AIG). world&amp;#039;s largest insurance firm  On their watch: In Willumstad&amp;#039;s brief tenure, AIG stock plunged from around $27 a share  to $2 a share, and the ailing firm agreed to an $85 billion government bailout. Sullivan left  after two quarters of record losses and $20 billion in sub prime-mortgage-related losses. Greenberg was credited with shaping AIG into the world&amp;#039;s largest insurer but was forced out in 2005 due to a fraud investigation. No charges were filed against him.   Payout: $7 million for Willumstad&amp;#039;s three months of work, $47 million for Sullivan and for Greenberg, despite the investigation, a 12 percent stake in AIG. That stake, however, isn&amp;#039;t worth what it was once was. After the government bailout, Greenberg&amp;#039;s $3billion interest nearly disappeared, and he dropped off the Forbes list of the richest people in the world        WaPo: After Bailout, AIG Executives Head to Resort (running up tab of $440,000) Posted by mod mom on Tue Oct-07-08 11:46 AM  After Bailout, AIG Executives Head to Resort UPDATED: 11:31 a.m.  Less than a week after the federal government offered an $85 billion bailout to insurance giant AIG, the company held a week-long retreat for its executives at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., running up a tab of $440,000, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant.  Showing a photograph of the resort, Waxman said the executives spent $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa.  &amp;quot;Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation,&amp;quot; Waxman said. &amp;quot;We will ask whether any of this makes sense. &amp;quot;  The committee will ask the company&amp;#039;s executives about their multimillion-dollar pay packages -- some of which they continue to receive -- as well as who bears responsibility for the company&amp;#039;s high-risk investment portfolio, which led to its near collapse just weeks ago.    http://voices.washingtonpost.com/livecoverage/2008/10/a...
