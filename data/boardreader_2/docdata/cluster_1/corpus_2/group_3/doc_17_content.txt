Here&amp;#039;s what AIG did with the $85B bailout money:     From Washington Post....     A few days after the federal government unveiled an   $85 billion bailout package   for the insurance company AIG, executives from one of the firm&amp;#039;s subsidiaries went on a   week-long retreat   to the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif. The tab: $443,000.     &amp;amp;quot;I was totally unaware that there was any plan for any conference,&amp;amp;quot; AIG&amp;#039;s ex-CEO,  Robert B. Willumstad , said today during his testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. &amp;amp;quot;Had I been aware of it I would have prevented it from happening.&amp;amp;quot;     When the retreat event was first noticed five days ago by The Orange County Register, a company spokesman noted that the conference included recognition for &amp;amp;quot;vital independent agents who distribute AIG American General&amp;#039;s products -- insurance for individuals and businesses. AIG American General -- a subsidiary of parent AIG -- is in much, much better financial shape than AIG itself.&amp;amp;quot;     &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s one of our viable businesses,&amp;amp;quot; spokesman  Joseph Norton  told the Register&amp;#039;s   &amp;amp;quot;OC Watchdog&amp;amp;quot; blog  . &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re fully capitalized. They&amp;#039;re fine. It wasn&amp;#039;t a corporate kind of thing.&amp;amp;quot;     Rebukes about the expensive retreat were just one aspect of a broad congressional hearing into AIG today, but it showed the level of distrust and political angst by lawmakers who have been pressed by constituents to take corporate executives to task for the financial crisis.     &amp;amp;quot;Well, average Americans are suffering economically. They&amp;#039;re losing their jobs, their homes and their health insurance,&amp;amp;quot; said Rep.  Henry A. Waxman  (D-Calif.), the panel&amp;#039;s chairman. &amp;amp;quot;Yet less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation.&amp;amp;quot;
