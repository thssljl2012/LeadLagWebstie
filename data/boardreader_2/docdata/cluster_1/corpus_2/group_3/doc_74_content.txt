So yeah, these folks can either renogiate the loan terms of can let the bottom continue to fall and take everything with it including everyone&amp;#039;s now worthless nest egg(s).                      Please post the memo.  That retreat was planned for months and, obviously, money was already earmarked and/or paid for it.  Not to mention that to cancel an event that size with short notice would have likely meant they&amp;#039;d have to pay for it anyways.  Oh yeah, what you and the media have failed to mention that this was the life insurance division of AIG (very profitable, as opposed to the securities side where the problem is) entertaining top producers who likely won a sales contest.

AIG drew fire at a congressional hearing on Tuesday for spending $200,000 on hotel rooms and $23,000 on spa services at an event lawmakers characterized as an executive retreat.      As lawmakers grilled former top executives, Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said: &amp;quot;They were getting facials, manicures and massages, while the American people were footing the bill.&amp;quot;       On Wednesday, AIG said the &amp;quot;business event,&amp;quot; hosted by one of its subsidiaries, was for independent life insurance agents. It said the event was planned &amp;quot;months before&amp;quot; it received the loan last month, and no AIG executives from headquarters attended.       AIG&amp;#039;s effort to correct the record on the event came after White House spokeswoman Dana Perino had added on Wednesday to criticism of the event.      &amp;quot;I understand why the American people would be outraged,&amp;quot; she said at a White House briefing.      President George W. Bush did not intend to benefit industry titans when he approved the bailout of AIG and a wider $700 billion Wall Street rescue package, she said.      &amp;quot;Rewarding failure is something we have a very hard time swallowing,&amp;quot; Perino added.      AIG said current Chief Executive Edward Liddy had written a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to clarify the circumstances of the business event.      The company said Liddy assured Paulson that AIG now faces very different challenges, saying: &amp;quot;(W)e owe our employees and the American public new standards and approaches,&amp;quot; and that the company is &amp;quot;re-evaluating the costs of all aspects of our operations...&amp;quot;      AIG said 10 employees from its subsidiary, AIG American General, attended the 100-guest event.

I&amp;#039;ll post it again:           Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  National Underwriter                      AIG Pact With U.S. Sidelines Stockholders   BY ARTHUR D. POSTAL   NU Online News Service, Sept. 24, 10:15 a.m. EDT      WASHINGTON &amp;amp;#8212;American International Group shareholders will apparently get no say in the running of the company under the conditions of the loan the U.S. government is providing the company to help deal with its liquidity crisis.       Moreover, until it is reconfigured and pays off the loan,  AIG will have to pay 8.5 percent interest even on the unused portion of the loan, and was forced to pay a 2 percent upfront commitment fee to the government in order to get the loan , according to details released yesterday.        On the $35 billion that AIG has borrowed so far the company will pay 8.5 percent on top of the current LIBOR rate of 3 percent.        The government has taken a 79.9 percent interest in the company. Based on what information has been released about the agreement, an analyst who declined to be named while complete details remain unclear said, &amp;amp;#8220;Shareholders have no more clout. It implies that existing shareholders are now holders of a minority stake in the company and therefore the government has complete voting control of the company.&amp;amp;#8221;       He said also that &amp;amp;#8220;this is a very expensive facility to have in place, let alone use. That will be another motivation to move quickly to reconfigure the company and then pay off the loan.&amp;amp;#8221;       Analysts at Credit Suisse calculated that the added costs related to the undrawn part of the facility will be an extra $4.7 billion of annualized interest expense for the current $55 billion of the undrawn line.       Credit Suisse analysts Thomas Gallagher and Michael Zaremski also said, &amp;amp;#8220;It is unclear whether AIG would be able to access the debt or equity markets prior to a large amount of asset sales.&amp;amp;#8221;       As a result, the Credit Suisse analysts said, they expect the stock to pull back from its recent gain, up above $5 after being below $2 during the height of last week&amp;amp;#8217;s crisis as the company teetered on bankruptcy.       AIG released details of the agreement late yesterday. It was apparently completed earlier in the day, a week after the Fed and Treasury Department agreed to help AIG avoid filing for bankruptcy by providing an $85 billion, two-year loan.       The government was forced to step in after the credit markets became closed to AIG as it sought to raise new capital needed to meet covenants under credit default swap contracts AIG entered into with counterparties seeking insurance on financial instruments that were backed by subprime loans that are plunging in value.       At the same time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed that it has opened &amp;amp;#8220;preliminary investigations&amp;amp;#8221; into possible fraud involving AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Lehman Bros., the center of the global financial crisis the U.S. government is now trying to calm, according to the Associated Press.       Earlier in the day, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox testified before a Senate Banking Committee hearing that it is investigating insurers as well as other participants in the subprime mortgage business that is at the center of the financial crisis.       The Credit Suisse analysts also said the latest AIG statement appeared to doom an initiative by large outside investors in AIG to forge an alternative to the government loan.       &amp;amp;#8220;There had been speculation that AIG could seek a private sector solution and thus avoid the government dilution, but the company indicated that this deal with the Fed represents its best option given the market turmoil,&amp;amp;#8221; said Credit Suisse.       AIG Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy noted this specifically in commenting on the final deal with the government.       &amp;amp;#8220;AIG made an exhaustive effort to address its liquidity needs through private sector financing but was unable to do so in the current environment,&amp;amp;#8221; Mr. Liddy said. &amp;amp;#8220;This facility was the company&amp;amp;#8217;s best alternative.&amp;amp;#8221;       &amp;amp;#8220;We are pleased to have finalized the terms of the facility and are already developing a plan to sell assets, repay the facility and emerge as a smaller but profitable company,&amp;amp;#8221; said Mr. Liddy.        Importantly, he added, &amp;amp;#8220;AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s insurance subsidiaries remain strong, liquid and well capitalized.&amp;amp;#8221;
