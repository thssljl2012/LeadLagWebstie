Seriously, its time to start shooting these people. Trials are expensive.                      There was something about this in Newsday today. Some **** was defending this, saying it was just part of the rewards that their workers get that was planned out for a year. He actually had the balls to claim this was a valid action.      A reward for what? What exactly have they done to earn a reward? When you get 85 billion dollars handed to you, that is taxpayer money, I don&amp;#039;t think that is the time to reward your workers for a job well done. Just where I want my money going. This is what I want to work for.      The article in Newsday also claimed that 23,000 dollars was spent on a Spa at this place. Fuckers should be hung. At least give them 10 years in Jail.
