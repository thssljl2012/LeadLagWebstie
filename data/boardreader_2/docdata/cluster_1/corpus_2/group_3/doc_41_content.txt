             This scandalous story was somehow ignored here  in the rush for mud-slinging stories recently,  Now the AIG execs are trying to make their spending of the money sounds more easy to swallow.    The CEO of the giant AIG Insurance Company, Edward Liddy, today defended spending $440,000 on a retreat at a luxurious California resort as &amp;quot;standard practice in our industry&amp;quot; because it rewarded independent insurance agents who were top performers for the company. The event, at the St. Regis Resort and Spa at Monarch Beach, California was held less than a week after the federal government saved AIG from bankruptcy with $85 billion in loans.    http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5987363&amp;amp;page=1   Angeline Speakeasy Moderator  click here to email semods4@yahoo.com
