For one, I think the banks should deal with there own problems instead of the government &amp;amp;quot;helping&amp;amp;quot; them. Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California which was $400,000... That is helping the U.S. people, how?
