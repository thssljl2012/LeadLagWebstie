AIG Bailout and Spa Visits, Sarah Palin&amp;#039;s Assets, and Toxic Trailers Posted October 8, 2008  House Oversight Committee: Hearing on AIG Bailout: Following the September bailout of insurance giant AIG at an estimated cost of $85 billion, the House Committee on Oversight and Government reform held a hearing to, in the words of committee chairman Henry Waxman, &amp;quot;examine the details of AIG&amp;#039;s fall so that we can learn lessons about the reforms needed to restore stability to our financial markets.&amp;quot; Among the questions, as laid out by Waxman: Who bears responsibility? Was the public misled about the financial health of the company? Was executive compensation appropriate? The committee heard testimony from former AIG executives as well as auditors and regulators. Longtime AIG CEO Hank Greenberg, who did not testify because of illness, submitted a statement attributing much of the trouble to heavy losses on the AIG financial products side. In light of overall market turmoil, former CEO Robert Willumstad said, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t believe AIG could have done anything differently.&amp;quot; Meanwhile, Waxman criticized AIG for holding an executive retreat at an &amp;quot;exclusive&amp;quot; resort mere days after the bailout. Receipts and invoices in evidence show some $443,000 for rooms, meals, and spa services.
