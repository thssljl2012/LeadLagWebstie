      Ha, people are so fucking stupid.  I know it&amp;#039;s too much to expect some of you to understand how insurance works, but is it too much to ask that you read the God Damn article?          Quote:      AIG, once the world&amp;#039;s largest insurer, disputed Mr. Waxman&amp;#039;s characterization of the conference. Spokesman Nicholas Ashooh said the event had been scheduled a year earlier by AIG&amp;#039;s American General life insurance subsidiary as a way to reward independent agents who sell the company&amp;#039;s products.         &amp;amp;quot;This is very standard in the industry to reward the top 5 to 10% of top sellers,&amp;amp;quot;  he said. &amp;amp;quot; In the insurance business, it&amp;#039;s as basic as salary as a means to reward performance.  It was not AIG executives running away to California.&amp;amp;quot;        Independent agencies don&amp;#039;t work for AIG.  They sell AIG products (as well as other insurance carriers) and receive a commission.  The Top 5-10% (depending on the company) are then rewarded.  All in, they spent what, under $500,000 for this thing?  Yet it&amp;#039;s to reward agents who EACH made well over $5 MILLION for AIG.        So what, AIG gets bought, and they should just stop paying their commissions as well?  What do you think that would do to the government&amp;#039;s investment in the company?        But no, keep going on about your &amp;amp;quot;class warfare&amp;amp;quot;, and &amp;amp;quot;businesses can&amp;#039;t police themselves&amp;amp;quot;.  Don&amp;#039;t let facts get in the way.  You never really do, anyyway.        Laughable ignorance, per usual.
