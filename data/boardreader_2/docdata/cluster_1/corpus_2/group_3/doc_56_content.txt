  Quote from: abcnews  Less than a week after the federal government committed &amp;amp;#036;85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.   &amp;amp;quot;Rooms at this resort can cost over &amp;amp;#036;1,000 a night,&amp;amp;quot; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.  AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid more than &amp;amp;#036;440,000 for the retreat, including nearly &amp;amp;#036;200,000 for rooms, &amp;amp;#036;150,000 for meals and &amp;amp;#036;23,000 in spa charges.  &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).  &amp;amp;quot;This unbridled greed,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), &amp;amp;quot;it&amp;amp;#039;s an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars.&amp;amp;quot;   Appearing before the committee, Martin Sullivan, the AIG CEO until June, said the company was overwhelmed by a &amp;amp;quot;financial global tsunami,&amp;amp;quot; and that &amp;amp;quot;no simple or single cause&amp;amp;quot; was to blame.   http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=5973452&amp;amp;amp;page=1    Well, I guess borrowing ridiculous amounts of money because you&amp;amp;#039;re an incompetent piece of shit can be tiring work!  &amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;&amp;amp;#95;      Quote from: Trystero  Tool- A man reads the Bible, says &amp;amp;quot;boy, that was a good book&amp;amp;quot;, and promptly falls off a cliff. He lands right next to an electric guitar. Dazed and confused, he starts to play it.
