AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid   more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for   rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.      &amp;amp;quot;Their rgetting their pedicures and their manicures and the American   people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).                 And it only cost the taxpayers about $12,000 EACH.  Or, it cost the average    two-income household about $23,000.  That&amp;#039;s $1.6 Trillion (in principle plus    interest) divided by 138,000,000 taxpayers.  Do the math.  The math doesn&amp;#039;t    lie, and it doesn&amp;#039;t exaggerate.  -Dave
