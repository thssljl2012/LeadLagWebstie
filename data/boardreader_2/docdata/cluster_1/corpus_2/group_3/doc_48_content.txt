 This was touched on in the debate...just wondering how people feel about this:    http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5973452            Quote:                         Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.       Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night,&amp;amp;quot; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.       AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.       &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).       &amp;amp;quot;This unbridled greed,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), &amp;amp;quot;it&amp;#039;s an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars.&amp;amp;quot;       Appearing before the committee, Martin Sullivan, the AIG CEO until June, said the company was overwhelmed by a &amp;amp;quot;financial global tsunami,&amp;amp;quot; and that &amp;amp;quot;no simple or single cause&amp;amp;quot; was to blame.                           Stupid, out of touch dumbass rich f-ers.        America is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, peoples lives are being destroyed, retirement savings gone, shareholders livelihoods dissolved...and you jerks go get manicures at some CA spa?  Are you kidding me?  You take my f-ing money and get your god damn nails done?  I can barely pay my bills and you take my money and go on vacation?  WTF is wrong with this picture?      They should be forced to pay it back.  Pay it all back.  Every cent.  They should all lose their jobs...every person involved and who attended.  In light of everything that is going on...you thought it a good idea to spend 400,00 taxpayers dollars to fund your freaking vacation?  Un-freaking-believable.      Do the world a favor...relieve us all of your presence here.  Thanks in advance...
