 This just in from the overseas wire:    Fat cat American insurance bosses flew  to England in a private jet for a 60,000 weekend partridge shoot just after their failing company received a 65billion government bailout, it  was revealed today.  The astonishing company jaunt to an undisclosed English country mansion last  night  provoked a storm of outrage in New York and Washington.  New York&amp;amp;#8217;s top prosecutor, Attorney General Andrew  Cuomo - who revealed the  party along with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of golf outings and luxury holidays &amp;amp;#8211; demanded that two former executives of the AIG insurance conglomerate should repay the money, plus millions they had received in bonuses and golden parachutes as they left.         Angry: New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announces he is investigating spending by AIG       If it  is not repaid, Mr Cuomo said he would go to court to get it back for taxpayers using state fraud laws.    In a furious letter to the company&amp;amp;#8217;s new bosses he said he had the power to reverse  &amp;amp;#8216;inappropriate spending&amp;amp;#8217; as long as New York-based AIG was being  propped up with  the loans from the Federal Reserve, the US central bank.  Mr Cuomo, son of  Mario Cuomo, a famous former New York City Mayor, said: &amp;amp;#8216;AIG&amp;#039;s belief is that they had the party, and the taxpayers will have the hangover.&amp;amp;#8217;   In an angry letter yesterday to AIG Mr Cuomo wrote: &amp;amp;#8216;The board awarded its chief  executive officer a cash bonus of over $5million and a golden parachute worth $15million.     Similarly, in February 2008, a top-ranking executive who was largely responsible for AIG&amp;#039;s collapse was terminated, but still permitted by the board to keep $34million in bonuses. This same individual apparently continued to receive $1million a month from the company until recently.&amp;amp;#8217;   An AIG spokesman said: &amp;amp;#8216;The company has received Mr Cuomo&amp;amp;#8217;s letter and will of  course co-operate fully with the attorney general&amp;amp;#8217;s office. It will get the  immediate attention of  the board.&amp;amp;#8217;   Talking about the partridge shoot, spokesman Peter Tulupman said: &amp;amp;#8216;We regret  this event  was not cancelled. It was an annual event.  LONDON MAIL    In the meantime the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT NEWS reported this morning that AIG is now using some of the taxpayer money it was given to hire lobbiest to get some government oversight in the bailout package loosened.
