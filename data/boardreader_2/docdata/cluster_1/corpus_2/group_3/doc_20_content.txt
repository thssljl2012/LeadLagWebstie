Part of the continuing saga of AIG has been two important facts: first, that credit default swaps marketed by the parent or holding company of AIG   have escaped state insurance regulatory oversight because of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000,   and second, policyholders are safe because the AIG insurance subsidiaries are financially sound.      http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/21/mccain-deregulation/    McCain: Im glad I deregulated Wall Street.
