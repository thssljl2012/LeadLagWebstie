The whole article is BS.      A.   The retreat was not execs from AIG the holding company, but rather, a Life Insurance Subsidiary, which spent its own money, not AIG the holding company&amp;#039;s money, to pay for the retreat.   The insurer entities have their own financial statement requirements which are highly regulated.  The insurer entities are solvent, VERY solvent.  And as a matter of law, the Insurer Entities are not permitted to upstream their money to the holding company.  You might remember, before the Government loan, AIG in fact TRIED to upstream money from its insurer entities, sought permission from the NY Dept of Insurance, and were at first told yes, and then, no, they could not do so.      The insurer entities are not seeing a dime of the $85 billion.  And the insurer entities are going to be the ones that make AIG solvent again.  Moreover, lets not forget, that $85 billion was a loan @ 11.65% interest plus 79% warrants, not a gift.       B.  I bet you dollars to donut the bulk of the retreat was paid for up to 6 months before the liquidity issue caused the need for the case injection from the government.  Would it have been smarter to have not gone, and thrown that money away?  Those resorts don&amp;#039;t give you your money back if you cancel.      C.  It sounds like a big tab, but I&amp;#039;ve not seen any numbers about how many people were in attendance.  I&amp;#039;m sure it was swanky and overpriced, and likely exhorbitant, but this really is not the big bad boondoggle the media, and Obama, is making it out to be.
