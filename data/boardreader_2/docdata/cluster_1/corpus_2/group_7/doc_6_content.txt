          http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7886512.stm    'The investigation - in co-ordination with the City watchdog the Financial Services Authority - is focused on the firm's financial products arm.  AIG's insurance operations are not affected, the SFO said.'   Now, the key issue is whether CDSs are defined as insurance products, or are financial products?  [Explanation - CDSs are called Swaps because although they are insurance policies, they are not called insurance to avoid being regulated as insurance.  Also, in testimony before Christmas, the New York academic who constructed AIG's CDS risk models alleges he was ordered not to consider two major risk factors, including the possibility that the mortgages underlying MBSs could fall in value!]  Watch this space because it might explain much of what is happening in UK politics, including perhaps why the Equitable Life investigation, which proved inadequate financial regulation in the UK, was bitterly resisted by government for 8 years!
