    The Peter Cooper/Stuyvesant Town assets were on the books of MetLife,    CO.     long before MetLife,    INC.     came into being.  At demutualization, assets of MetLife, Co. were specifically barred from any possibility of being available to stockholders, either then or now.  The NYS Insurance Commissioner would have much to say about any move to have Life Insurance Reserves transferred to stockholders.         The recent news regarding MetLife's offer to acquire part of AIG is regarding  only  specific parts of AIG's Life Insurance business (aka Alico).  It's a resonable offer, and well within the boundaries of what MetLife, Co. has been doing for well over a hundred years -- and continues to do very well to this day.       So, Irving, despite what happens to MetLife, Inc., aren't you glad that your policies are on the books of MetLife, Co.?  Your measly (2 or 3) shares of MetLife, Inc.  may  become worthless, but the surrender value or death benefit of your MetLife, Co. insurance policies are perfectly safe, and will continue to be perfectly safe.       Irving: before you rant nonsense, read the fine print!  And that includes GAAP for Insruance Companies.
