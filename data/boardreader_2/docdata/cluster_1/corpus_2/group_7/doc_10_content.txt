Marc, let's assume that it's AIG Life Insurance Company. My ability to analyze this company's financial condition is quite limited, so  I have to rely on the likes of A.M. Best, Fitch, S&amp;P, etc.  They could be wrong, but they all seem to think that from an  insurer solvency  standpoint that all the AIG insurance companies are in the same boat, and that boat is as sturdy a vessel as any other insurer's.        For the record, I do have concerns about the future of AIG insurance. It's looking like the industry could potentially lose a very innovative, and often competitive, insurance market through the divestitures that must take place and the already fleeing talent pool.  It's a shame that non-insurance activities took down such an insurance titan.  What's even more amazing is that it happened in roughly 36 hours.         However, I do not have particular concern for those individuals/companies with AIG policies that their claims will not be paid.  As I stated, these are quite different issues.  When an insurance company gets sold off, or the renewal rights are sold off, then it is time to re-evaluate whether one should be with the new insurer.  People who are already making decisions to leave could in fact be jumping from the kettle to the fire, so to speak.  They are often doing it hastily without proper coverage analysis.  And uninformed 'chicken little' behavior is certainly exacerbating AIG's problems.  By the way, I have no affiliation with AIG.
