Quote:                         WASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co fired Chief Executive Jerry Jurgensen, an industry source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.      Nationwide Mutual, a provider of life insurance and annuity products, on Thursday named its president and chief operating officer, Steve Rasmussen, to replace Jurgensen.      The source said it was not clear why Jurgensen was fired.      Joe Case, a spokesman for the Ohio-based company, said, "Mr. Jurgensen's stepping down was by mutual agreement with the board."      Rasmussen has been with Nationwide since 1998 and has been the president and COO of Nationwide Mutual and Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance since 2003.
