            That's not a very exciting head line is it?How about this headline: AIG splurges $440,000 tab for a weeklong retreat at the posh St. Regis Resort in California for top-performing insurance agents.Wow, that's much more exciting isn't it? But the sad fact is both titles are true.AIG issued a statement saying that the business event was planned months before the Sept. 16 bailout and that it was held for top-producing independent life insurance agents, not AIG employees. Of the 100 attendees, only 10 worked for the AIG unit hosting the event, it said.So AIG spent $4,400 an a person to reward agents that sold millions in insurance last year. BFD.Here is the other hot story: AIG spent thousands on execs hunting tripFirst there was the $440,000 American Insurance Group Inc. spent entertaining executives days after receiving an $85 billion lifeline from the Federal Reserve, now its $86,000 for a hunting trip in England as the faltering company reaped another $37.8 billion in taxpayer funded loans.Company officials said the hunting trip in the English countryside was an annual event for customers that had been planned months before the bailout. The company pledged  as it did following the September trip  to do everything possible to end such extravagances. They declined to say which AIG executives attended.$86,000??? BFD. How many people were there? AIG says that this is an annual trip so it was planned way in advance. Cancelling it would have cost about 1/2 as much so why bother?Brent can help me with this, but here is a summary of the expenses from my last business trip to Beijing:Plane ticket: $7,250Hotel: $2,100Expenses: $750Total: $10,100This is a continuation of the class warefare that the press doles out everyday.Labels: More crap from the media
