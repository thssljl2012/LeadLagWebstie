                   Un-freaking-believable!!!Why wasnt I invited to the party?From The Washington Post:For some people at AIG, the insurance giant rescued last month with an $85 billion federal bailout, the good times keep rolling And just last week, about 70 of the company's top performers were rewarded with a week-long stay at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., where they ran up a tab of $440,000. At a House committee hearing yesterday, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) showed a photograph of the resort, which overlooks the Pacific Ocean, and reported expenses for AIG personnel including $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa. "Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation," Waxman said in kicking off an angry hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. "We will ask whether any of this makes sense." "They were getting their manicures, their pedicures, massages, their facials while the American people were paying their bills," thundered Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). The gathering was planned before the bailout as a reward for life insurance agents, a company spokesman said, and fewer than 10 AIG executives were present Even if this gathering was planned before the bailout, no one thought about the inappropriateness of going ahead with it? No morals in corporate America or in Washington.We live on a sinking ship and there is no one out to help us out.WTF!Labels: Corporate Watch, Off The Reservation
