So we gave them 85 BILLION dollars, and they go away and spend $440,000 dollars on a week long spa retreat.http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5973452&amp;page=1Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.Two AIG CEOs testify to Congress about their use of taxpayer bailout money."Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night," Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.AIG documents obtained by Waxman's investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges."They're getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that," said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD)."This unbridled greed," said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), "it's an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars."Appearing before the committee, Martin Sullivan, the AIG CEO until June, said the company was overwhelmed by a "financial global tsunami," and that "no simple or single cause" was to blame.
