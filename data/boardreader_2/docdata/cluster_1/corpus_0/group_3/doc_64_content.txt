Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant. Showing a photograph of the resort, Waxman said the executives spent $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa. "Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation," Waxman said. "We will ask whether any of this makes sense. "The committee will ask the companys executives about their multimillion-dollar pay packages  some of which they continue to receive  as well as who bears responsibility for the companys high-risk investment portfolio, which led to its near collapse just weeks ago. "They were getting their manicures, their pedicures, massages, their facials while the American people were paying their bills," thundered Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), of the executive retreat at the Monarch Resort.This from http://breakingpoint.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/yeah-that-bailout-was-a-great-idea/Nigh half a million dollars spent on a "retreat".
