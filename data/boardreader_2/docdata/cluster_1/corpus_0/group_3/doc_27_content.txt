USA, you voted in this $700Billion Dollar thing basicly because the banks said "we won't do it again".Wrong. They hate you. They've got their way and they've gone back to not just laughing at you behind your back, but rubbing it in your face. They've got what they wanted, so fuck you.After Bailout, AIG Execs Head to California ResortLess than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today....AIG documents obtained by Waxman's investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges."They're getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that," said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).Does this inspire you with confidence in AIG? Sell your shares. Kill the company now before they come back begging for more to throw in your faces.
