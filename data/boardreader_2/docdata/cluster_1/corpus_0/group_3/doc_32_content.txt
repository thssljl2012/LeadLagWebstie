According to ABC News: OCTOBER 7, 2008  Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today. AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#8217;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges. &amp;#8220;Their getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;#8221; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD). &amp;#8220;This unbridled greed,&amp;#8221; said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars.&amp;#8221; Well, maybe it was a retreat for sensitivity training&amp;#8230;.
