 From an article in USA Today, dated 10/8, by Anna Bahney.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Six days after the government rescued AIG with an $85 billion loan, the insurance company spent $443,000 on a week-long event for agents at a California resort, according to invoices produced during a congressional hearing Tuesday.&amp;nbsp; According to records the committee obtained, the event's expenses included nearly $200,000 for rooms, about $150,000 for banquets and $23,000 for spa services.&amp;nbsp; Also during the hearing, the House committee revealed that Joseph Cassano, the head of the finance division largely responsible for AIG's $5 billion loss in the last quarter of 2007, was allowed to keep up to $34 million in unvested bonuses and placed on a $1 million-a-month consulting retainer when he left AIG in February.  When Wal-mart had a bad quarter (just not as good as usual, never a loss)&amp;nbsp; they would eliminate meetings or if they had one the managers would get box lunches to eat.&amp;nbsp; A sandwich and an apple.&amp;nbsp; If you elect me President I will put the entire federal government on a box lunch budget and company's like AIG and all the rest would not have gotten one dime of your tay money.&amp;nbsp; Vote Roe for President.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for your support.  P.S.&amp;nbsp; Today AIG just got $37 Billion more of your tax dollars.&amp;nbsp; They can have another meeting.&amp;nbsp; I am sure they will toast you.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
