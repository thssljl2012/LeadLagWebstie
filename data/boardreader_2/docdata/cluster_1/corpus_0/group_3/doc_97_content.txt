The insurer American International Group Inc. said Friday it plans to sell off a number of business units to pay off its massive government loan, while retaining its U.S. property and casualty and foreign general insurance businesses. AIG, one of the world's biggest insurers, also said it plans to retain an ownership interest in its foreign life insurance operations. One unit that analysts have said could be sold is the International Lease Finance Corp., which leases out more than 900 aircraft with asset values topping $44 billion at the end of the second quarter. Another unit that could possibly be sold, consumer-focused lender American General Finance Corp.
