After Bailout, AIG Execs Head to California Resort ABC News Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.  "Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night," Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.  AIG documents obtained by Waxman's investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.  "They're getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that," said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).   "This unbridled greed," said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), "it's an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars."And what will be done about it? The sound of crickets in three, two, one...  But hey, the CEO was severely punished for his mismanagement. "Mr. Sullivan and the other top executives should have had their bonuses slashed due to poor performance," said Waxman.  Sullivan said it was "substantially reduced" by the board in 2007 due to poor performance.  Sullivan was given a $15 million "golden parachute" payment after being replaced as CEO in June. That'll learn him!!
