     Insurance giant AIG, fresh off getting another round of federal taxpayer money, says it plans to pay out $503 million in deferred compensation to some of its top employees. The company says it needs to use the bailout funds to keep valuable workers from exiting the troubled insurance giant, according to the Washington Post.Uh, are they really that valuable if the company found itself needing gazillions of dollars from Uncle Sam?
