Details of what the next Government (taxpayer) bailout of American International Group (AIG) will look like are beginning to surface this Sunday morning. AIG&#8217;s Board of Directors are being called to a special Sunday night meeting to vote on another rescue for the company. Information coming off the wires&#8230; BOARD TO VOTE ON NEW BAILOUT PACKAGE THAT WOULD EASE THE TERMS OF THE BAILOUT - The revised AIG agreement is expected to include an additional equity commitment of about $30B, more lenient terms on an existing preferred investment, and a lower interest rate on a $60B government credit line - The new equity commitment would give AIG the ability to issue preferred stock to the government at a later date - AIG will also give the Federal Reserve ownership interests in American Life Insurance (Alico), which generates more than half of its revenue from Japan, and Hong Kong-based life insurance group American International Assurance Co (AIA) in return for reducing its debt - AIG may also securitize some U.S. life insurance policies and give them to the government to further reduce its debt. AIG will &#8217;securitize&#8217; life insurance policies? Securitizing mortgages is what contributed to the global financial mess to begin with. Now AIG wants to securitize life insurance policies&#8230; When will the financial madness ever end? Reminder: Is is expected that AIG will be announcing the largest corporate loss in United States history Sunday evening or Monday.
