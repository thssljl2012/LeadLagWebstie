AIG will fail before the end of Wednesday.The generically named American International Group is the 18th largest company in the world, with a $1 trillion balance sheet.  Its primary business is in insurance, but on a scale you might not be familiar with.Normal insurance companies pool risk for individuals, but they themselves are subject to the risk of truly epic disasters.  What happens when 30% of the homes you insure are destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in a single day?  Just like individuals can absorb relatively small risks (dropping your cell phone) but need to take out insurance to protect against relatively large risks (a tree falling on your house), insurance companies can handle any number of trees falling on houses but need some sort of protection against truly epic disasters.So insurance companies buy insurance of their own.  They turn to companies like AIG - the biggest of the big.  AIG is actually so big that it's called an insurance holding company, and in order to more efficiently pool risk owns outright literally hundreds of smaller subsidiaries in countries all over the globe.  There are wholly owned AIG subsidiaries in Japan and the UK and partially owned subsidiaries in China.Like all insurance companies, AIG doesn't just sit on the money they make from premiums.  In order to make a larger profit and offer lower rates, they invest that money.  AIG was more aggressive than most insurance companies in investing this money.  One asset they invested particularly heavy in was - you guessed it - mortgage-backed securities.  This sometimes lead to AIG owning the loans on the same homes that it insured... very indirectly.AIG's stock has fallen 95% this year.  They are now trading on pennies on the dollar.  New York governor Patterson says they have 24 hours to find capital or they're bankrupt.  And the obvious question is:  where is the money going to come from?My guess is, probably us.  Again.  But we'll find out tomorrow.
