The U.S. federal government and FRB may now have something to regret in weeks/months to come by letting Lehman Brothers to go belly up and file for bankruptcy while saving AIG because it's &amp;quot;too big to fail&amp;quot; without showing any criteria as to how big a financial institution has to be to be saved. If Lehman is not big enough, then most of them would be not big enough. Their reason for bailing AIG seems to be primarily the &amp;quot;influence&amp;quot;, but what's gonna happen if an insurance company smaller than Lehman (how you compare the size of an insurance company and an investment bank is another problem) goes into crisis mode? Is it all up to the feds to decide? A bit too much of unpredictability... But I guess they don't want their hands tied as they can't predict what kind of situation they will be facing in the (probably near) future.Also, AIG insures all kinds of things, from airplane to business loans to personal life insurance. Seems to me any defaults will be incurred by the federal government; are the American taxpayers aware of this? And this could lead to a moral hazard (you know you can rely on your AIG insurance if things go wrong, as the Uncle Sam will eventually be bailing you out by way of hurting the balance sheet of AIG- and if AIG asset turn out to be not enough, they would probably have to put some government money into it). Did they really think this through? Or maybe they just didn't have enough time....          Read and post comments            Send to a friend
