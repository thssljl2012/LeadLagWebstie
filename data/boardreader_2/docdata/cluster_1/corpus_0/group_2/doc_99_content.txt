  Gov. Paterson and his insurance department approved an assistance package for AIG today that "allows the insurer access to $20 billion of its own capital," according to Bloomberg:  "Paterson said he had worked with AIG in a bid to help save New York jobs, with the insurer employing 6,000 in Manhattan and 8,600 statewide. He added that the plan was carefully crafted to pose no risk to New York taxpayers.  "New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo is appealing to the federal government on AIG's behalf to provide it additional access to capital, Paterson said."  Here's the problem: The AIG infusion is coming from regulated insurance subsidiaries, whose reserves are being made available as collateral for the unregulated and financially distressed parent. The state Insurance Department is supposed to be protecting holders of life, property and casualty policies -- not risking the security of those policies for AIG jobs.  So, it's nice that the taxpayers aren't at risk, but what about the policyholders, who Paterson is also supposed to be protecting?  Insurance Department spokesman David Neustadt tells us they are safe. The plan approved by regulators, he said, does not reduce the reserves of the regulated companies -- it allows AIG to exchange $20 billion in less-liquid assets held by the parent for $20 billion in more liquid assets held by the subsidiaries -- an exchange involving no less than 25 percent to 33 percent of reserves of the regulated subsidiaries.  Neustadt said the assets that are being exchanged are of equivalent quality and value -- it's just that the more liquid assets can be more easily collateralized. Which makes sense, except....we're still not clear on why credit markets (i.e. lenders) like one type of asset more than another if they're equivalent.
