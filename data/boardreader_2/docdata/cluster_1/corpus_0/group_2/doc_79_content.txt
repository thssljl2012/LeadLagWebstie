While many look at AIG the largest insurance company in the world which is in trouble, I prefer to focus on WaMu the largest thrift in the US. A once thriving company that has seen better days.Its stock went from almost 40 a year ago to less than 2 today. A portfolio heavy in risky real-estate loans sent it to the bottom. Yesterday mortgage giant Washington Mutual was downgraded down to "junk" by the S&amp;amp;P ratings agency due to insufficient collateral or margin requirements.And in other news the Fed will soon cut interest rates due to a global financial crisis and mortgage meltdown. This may prop up the markets, but even so we see more trouble ahead.
