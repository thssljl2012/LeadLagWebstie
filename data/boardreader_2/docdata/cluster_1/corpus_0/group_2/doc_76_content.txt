For all you new owners of mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have I got a deal for you. For only 85 billion dollars you now own an insurance company too. That's right, the Federal Reserve is "loaning" your 85 bil to AIG, the world's largest insurance company, in exchange for 80 percent of the company. Apparently they were going to eat it without the help. We're told it's a good deal, though if it was so good then why didn't anyone else pony up the cash.Congratulations once again you lucky Americans!
