NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- American International Group is the world's largest insurer and at the moment, Wall Street's biggest worry.The insurer is struggling to raise cash while economists and investors debate whether or not it should get a government bailout. But despite the importance of the company, the average American is probably not sure how, or why, its problems will affect them.Here are five key questions and answers about AIG's current woes and what they mean to you.Read the important details at CNNMoney.com- Here is the summary of the article above in my own words.I have insurance through AIG. How worried should I be about the problems at the company?The problems lies with the holding company and not the individual insurance subsidiaries hence there might be a "possibility" that the subsidiaries will continue to operate normally with no disruption in claims payments.What guarantees are there that my claims will be paid?In event that AIG goes into bankruptcy or financial distress and having the claims that is more then the subsidiaries' assets the insurance regulator in it's home state will take control of the firm and make payments.This applies to traditional insurance policy and annuities retirement policy which is specifically mentioned in the article but for others...it's not stated.But there are limits to the payments that will be made to customers that vary depending on which state a particular AIG subsidiary is based.Should I be thinking about changing my policy away from AIG to another insurer?Depends on what types of insurance policy you hold, if it's purely life insurance then do note that your health changes and age will affect your premiums and coverage in event of changing your insurer.That means don't withdraw policy that have high coverage of life, personal accident, permanent disability, hospitalization, Medical and Annuities.That also possibly means those savings endowment, investment linked, high risk fund manager controlled funds can be switched to another insurer at a loss of initial agent commissions &amp;amp; short term loss. Taking these out may means a direct loss but it's better then totally gone? (Correct me if I am wrong)Why should I care about problems at AIG if I'm not a customer?AIG is by far the world's largest insurer and its stock is found in many mutual funds, including any S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund. It is also a component of the Dow Jones industrial average. All by itself, it's been responsible for dragging the Dow down more than 400 points so far this year.AIG is also active in the business of credit default swaps, complicated financial instruments used by investors to protect themselves from bond defaults. Lehman Brothers (LEH, Fortune 500) was another major player in that field. If both go away, it would create a tighter credit market for consumers and businesses trying to get loans.AIG is an insurer, not a lender. Why do I keep hearing about its problems with subprime mortgages?AIG made a bigger investment into securities that were backed by subprime mortgages than most other insurers. As defaults and foreclosures of those loans rose, the value of those securities fell, creating big problems for the firm.Simply to describe it is AIG uses the premiums paid to them to invest into different forms of assets such as subprime backed securities and may suffer similar fate.- Now that we know the above scenarios and answers from the article by CNNMoney, the next question is will the state from the subsideries are able to use state fund to pay out claims by AIG's insurance subsideries?This for Singapore, we have to monitor what the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) to see their reactions to the AIG share prices crashing crisis.My bets are the MAS officials are watching intensly on the shares of AIG right now and drawing out contingency plans for the public panic by the ill informed.My other guess is that the ever hard working state publication will publish "facts" about AIG pending crisis and answers to questions similar to the above ones full front page news.
