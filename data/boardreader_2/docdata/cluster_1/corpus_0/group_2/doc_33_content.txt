 Everyone has read about or heard newscasts related to the financial problems being experienced by AIG Insurance Group. Insurance companies and financial institutions have failed relatively regularly in the last few years, so why is AIG's problems causing so much turmoil.      One reason is probably that AIG is one of the giants in international insurance and financial matters. AIG has always brought to mind images such as the giant who is not afraid to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but fears no evil, because he is the biggest and "baddest" giants in the valley. AIG has always been one of the companies by which all others have been measured. If AIG can be in $75 billion in trouble, what may happen to the rest of these industries?     The other reason is probably just the failure of Lehman Brothers, the save of Merrill Lynch, and the government bail out of Bear Stearns. One could fairly say that these are tremulous times.      So should AIG policyholders panic? Not yet. The feds have agreed to bail AIG out with a two year, short term loan of $75 billion. Furthermore, AIG reports that their assets remain strong and they appear to have reasonable liquidity. The AIG umbrella also includes many different companies; many of which are sufficiently capitalized and have sufficient liquid assets to respond to demands.      In Florida, AIG has 46 subsidiary companies that operate; 34 selling property &amp;amp; Casualty insurance and 12 selling life insurance. Florida's insurance commissioner, Kevin McCarty advises:     "We have been told the insurance companies are solvent and will be able to pay claims. It is important that policyholders continue to pay their premiums to ensure that their coverage does not lapse," McCarty said. "I assure you that, if it should become necessary, we will immediately intervene if we feel that any one of the AIG companies operating in Florida will be unable to pay its claims and fulfill the promises made to its policyholders."        Most individual states have guarantee funds that will stand in the shoes of insolvent insurers, up to a certain limit that is usually $100,000 to $300,000 per policyholder. All of this good news said, should the condition of AIG worsen, it is quite possible that all the guarantee associations together may not have sufficient assets to fill the shoes of this giant.
