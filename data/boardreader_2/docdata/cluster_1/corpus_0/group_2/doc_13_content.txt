Email received from TATA AIGTrouble at American Insurance Group in US will have a bearing on its business inIndia, particularly its insurance business, which it is running in collaboration with Tata. However, sources in the industry say that the policy holders need not worry as the financial conditions of insurance subsidiaries of AIG inIndiais stable, and they can meet all the liabilities arising out of the claims from the policy holders.Insurance watchdog, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority has also expressed concern over the recent developments in the US Financial Markets. AIG, which is a leading insurance group of US, has sought financial support from the Federal Reserve. AIG is operating in both life and non-life insurance sector. In both the companies, Tata owns 74% stake each and AIG holds the rest 26%. With AIG facing the heat in US, IRDA has asked for a report from both Tata AIG LifeInsurance Companyand Tata AIG General Insurance Company on the development regarding one of its promoters AIG in theUS.In a statement, IRDA said accounts of life insurance and general insurance companies promoted by Tata Sons and AIG as onMarch 31, 2008indicate that both companies have satisfactory solvency margins, which suggest that it has enough assets to meet their liabilities. The IRDA further clarified that the life insurance and general insurance companies promoted by Tata Sons and AIG are companies registered under the Indian Companies Act and are bound by the provisions of the Insurance Act and other Regulations.Sources said that policy holders should wait for clarification and dust to settle down before taking any decision. "AIG in US has a liquidity issue, but inIndiathere is no solvency issue due to IRDA regulations. So there may not be a crisis in the Indian insurance market," a company official of a leading insurance player said. Though across many countries, policy holders are rushing to redeem their policies, it does not make sense to take any such step inIndia, industry experts said, adding that there is no need to panic and policy holders should keep invested.Tata AIG general insurance is among the top five general insurance company and has earned a premium of Rs 813 in 2007-08. Tata-Aig Life Insurance is also one of the leading private sector companies and has earned a first year premium of Rs 969 crore.The company source said that if AIG does not survive in theUSand is forced to file for bankruptcy, Tata will chip in and buy out the 26% stake of AIG in both the companies. And the customers' interest will remain unaffected. Later, Tata may find some other foreign partner to offload 26% stake that it will acquire from AIG. A senior IRDA official said that in any circumstances, if the promoter is found wanting in meeting the liabiliies, the regulator will find a new promoter, who will protect the interest of the customers. In either case, whether Tata buys out the stake or not, the policy holders' interest in both the companies will remain protected.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/Tata-AIG_policy_holders_need_not_worry/articleshow/3491428.cmshttp://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/09/17/stories/2008091752000600.htmhttp://deccanherald.com/Content/Sep172008/business2008091790458.asphttp://deccan.com/Business/Business.asphttp://www.financialexpress.com/news/Irda-asks-for-status-report-from-TataAIG/362226/http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1190825http://www.hindu.com/2008/09/17/stories/2008091756701600.htmhttp://www.asianage.com/presentation/leftnavigation/news/business/tata,-aig-jv-told-to-clarify.aspxhttp://www.dailypioneer.com/indexn12.asp?main_variable=BUSINESS&amp;file_name=busi10%2Etxt&amp;counter_img=10http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=12&amp;theme=&amp;usrsess=1&amp;id=222999http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080917/jsp/business/story_9845560.jsphttp://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=334602http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Crunch_time_at_AIG_India/articleshow/3491458.cmsIRDA SATISFIED WITH TATA AIG SOLVENCYNandini GoswamiDaily News &amp; AnalysisKolkata: While the credit crisis continues to weigh heavily on AIG,America's largest insurer, back home the Insurance Regulatory &amp; Development Authority (Irda) feels the Tata AIG group enjoys more than the required solvency as of now. It has,however, asked the insurance majors to submit reports with the latest position."The life insurance and general insurance companies promoted by M/s.

The accounts of these two companies as on 31 st March, 2008 indicate that both have satisfactory solvency margins which are adequate to meet their liabilities. However, having regard to the developments reported inUSA, we have asked for the reports of the companies in the matter," an Irda statement said."There is no concern as of now on the solvency front and the companies have more than the required solvency of 150%," Irda member R Kannan said.Sunil Mehta, country head AIG, told DNA Money: "Both the companies are very well capitalized and policyholders are well protected to take care of future liabilities. There are certain things beyond our control but it is unfair to speculate"."While the general insurance company is making profits, for the life side we always believed in calibrated growth, with an eye on the bottomline," he said.Meanwhile, according to a CNBC TV18 report, the solvency in TataAIG's life insurance business is 305%, while it's 176% for the general insurance business.http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1190825  INVEST CHIPS This post is written by R.John Christy for www.investchips.com.
