By next week newly appointed American International Group Inc.'s CEO Edward Liddy is supposed to release a list of all the assets for sale and may also announce some transactions within the next seven to 10 days.  Liddy said in an interview on CNBC late Monday that he expected to move swiftly to sell parts of the company to repay an emergency bailout loan. He said in the interview that AIG would focus on its traditional strengths in property casualty insurance and its international business, especially in Asia, after the asset sales. Liddy wants to sell the most valuable assets first to pay back the $85 billion loan by the Federal Reserve. Here's a sneak peak at what assets, potential prices and a list of bidders that could be interested in getting their hands on those businesses.   Real estate. AIG owns almost $16 billion worth of real estate around the world in more than 30 countries and 14 U.S. cities. Bloomberg reports that in New York City alone the insurer controls three office buildings with more than 2 million square feet. One of those Big Apple buildings is AIG's headquarters at 70 Pine St. in lower Manhattan. Experts say the 66-story office building in the financial district would make for a possible condo and/or residential conversion.Asset management and international operations. The Wall Street Journal also is reporting that&amp;nbsp;AIG is mulling the sale of its Brazilian assets, which include Unibanco-AIG, the fourth-largest Brazilian insurance company; a 7.34% stake in Providencia Industria e Comercio SA, a Brazilian manufacturer of plastics and textiles; and a local private equity fund.   The general insurance business including property casualty insurance, Transatlantic Holdings Inc. and its mortgage guaranty could be of interest to many insurers. AIG has a 59% stake in Transatlantic, which could be worth about $2.3 billion, according to an unnamed source speaking to The Daily Deal. Interested bidders could include Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Warren Buffett and Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, AIG's largest shareholder and former chairman. Greenberg disclosed interest in acquiring the company through his CV Starr &amp; Co. investment vehicle. Japan's Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. or Australia's QBE Insurance Group&amp;nbsp; could also be interested in the assets, according to Reuters.         The life Insurance and retirement business is the most valuable part of the business, according to The Daily Deal's Michael Rudnick, and could pay off almost half of the Federal Reserve's loan. AIG's domestic life operations could generate at least $41 billion from a sale, a source told The Daily Deal. AIG's foreign life insurance business could alone sell for $50 billion Gary Ransom, an analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton, told The Associated Press. Bidders for the life businesses might include Allianz SE, Sun Life Financial Inc., Munich Re, AXA Group, Manulife Financial Group and Prudential Financial Inc. Other potential bidders, according to Bloomberg, could include Chubb Corp., Ace Ltd. or Allianz's Fireman's Fund Insurance unit, which might be interested in buying AIG's unit that sells coverage to individuals through independent agents.     Financial Services, which includes aircraft leasing, capital markets and consumer finance operations, was an asset AIG was said to be exploring the sale of prior to the Federal Reserve's bailout of the company. AIG's International Lease Finance Corp., which leases more than 900 aircraft with asset values over $44 billion, could sell for its book value of about $7.5 billion, while the consumer finance operation could command its $2.5 billion book value, according to The Daily Deal. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that International Lease Finance may be bought by the unit's founder, Steven Udvar-Hazy. The unit's staff had shown interest in buying it from the parent a few months back.
