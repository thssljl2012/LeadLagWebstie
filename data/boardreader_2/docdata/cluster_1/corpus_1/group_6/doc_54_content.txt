9:56 am TWN, AFP SINGAPORE -- Nearly 3,000 people who invested in financial products linked to Lehman Brothers and other institutions will receive compensation, Singapore's central bank said Friday. About 10,000 people here invested in products linked to the collapsed US bank and other institutions hit by the financial crisis, and many have said the risks were not fully explained to them.   Almost all elderly investors with little income, little formal education and little investment experience have been offered full settlement, MAS, Singapore's central bank, said in a statement late Friday.   The bank had urged financial institutions to give priority to cases involving vulnerable investors and said it was probing allegations of misconduct in the sale of the products. Based on the cases decided by FIs (financial institutions) as of 14 January 2009, 58 percent of complainants will receive a full or partial settlement, the statement said.   More than half the 5,127 investors whose complaints have been dealt with so far will receive compensation, with 25 percent receiving a full settlement and 33 percent paid in part, it said.   MAS is satisfied that FIs have carefully reviewed the complaints based on principles of fairness without taking strict legal positions. This is reflected in the settlements offers that the FIs are making to the investors, said Shane Tregillis, a deputy managing director at the bank.   Investors who are not satisfied with the decision can go to the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Center, the central bank said.
