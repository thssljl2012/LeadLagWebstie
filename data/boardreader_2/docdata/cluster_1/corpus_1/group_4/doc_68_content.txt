China INSOnline Corp. (NASDAQ: CHIO), a rapidly  growing integrated licensed insurance services provider, which operates  www.soobao.cn, one of China's leading insurance services web portals,  reported today that revenues in its first fiscal quarter ended September  30, 2008 more than doubled compared to the same period last year, while net  income in the period grew approximately 45% compared to last year's first  quarter.  According to the Company, net revenues in its first fiscal quarter ended  September 30, 2008 reached $5,538,639, a 136% increase over revenues in  last year's first quarter of $2,346,886, while net income in this year's  first quarter grew to $2,462,064 from $1,832,636 in the same period last  year.  The Company attributed these sharp gains to the continued rapid growth in  its online advertising revenues, which accounted for about 64% of total  revenue growth, while a little more than one third of the revenue gain came  from continued growth in China INSOnline's software development segment. A  small (about 1%) contribution also was made by insurance agency services,  its newest business sector.  The Company attributed the increase in online insurance advertising --  which grew approximately 165% in the quarter -- to substantial growth in  the number of insurance agents who placed ads on the website.  Specifically, 87 teams of insurance agents placed ads in the September 30,  2008 quarter, compared with 14 teams in the same period last year.  Further, individual insurance agents on these teams completed 323 effective  contracts in the first quarter of 2008 compared with 41 effective contracts  in the first quarter last year.  At the same time, the Company said that Gross Profit in the first quarter  increased 123% to $5,033,978 despite the fact that Cost of Sales in the  period -- reflecting both the enlarged scale of operations and an increased  Business Tax for inter-company operations -- grew from 4% of net revenues  in last year's first quarter to 8% for the quarter ended September 30,  2008.  The Company also saw increases in General and Administrative Expenses and  Selling Expenses, also reflecting the Company's rapid expansion and, in the  latter case, increased spending for branding and promotion of the business  and its www.soobao.cn insurance web portal.  Strong Balance Sheet  As of September 30, 2008, the Company reported a 27% increase in cash and  cash equivalents to $8,137,156 and also said it had no debt financing with  any bank or other financial institution. Consequently, all of its capital  continues to be equity capital.  Outlook  Chief Executive Officer of China INSOnline Corp., Mrs. Betty Xu, commented,  'These strong results reflect the growing awareness of www.soobao.cn and  the value it provides to participants in China's still very young insurance  industry.'  She added, 'Our strategy remains linked to the steady expansion of our  insurance web portal throughout Greater China, by building our  relationships with insurance agents and companies, coupled with the  addition and development of new services that can be provided via the  internet. We expect we will create a nationwide insurance supermarket  which will be combined with the internet to allow us to strengthen our  industry leadership and continue our growth.'  Mr. Zhenyu Wang, Chairman of the Board, stated, 'We continue to make the  job of insurance agents an easier one, while providing them with a rapidly  expanding marketing platform that is seeing higher usage in line with the  general e-commerce trends throughout China.'
