(XFN-ASIA via COMTEX) -- LFC   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- China Life is eyeing overseas acquisitions as it seeks to take advantage of the global financial crisis to gain a foothold in foreign markets, the Financial Times reported.  Citing Liu Lefei, chief investment officer of China Life, the world's largest life assurer, the newspaper said the moment to begin making overseas investments was fast approaching.  'We are cautiously but actively looking for M&amp;amp;A opportunities... We have been doing a lot of research and the opportunities are becoming more and more obvious,' Liu told the newspaper, adding that potential targets are likely to be small or medium-sized financial firms or larger ones that had run into trouble and were likely to start selling off non-core assets.  The targets could be anywhere in the US, Asia or Europe, he said.  China Life has not made any overseas strategic investments, and its investment portfolio is almost entirely domestic, the newspaper noted.  It added that China Life has been mentioned as a potential buyer for parts of AIG's Asia Pacific business if the troubled insurance group puts the assets up for sale.  At the end of September, China Life had 30.5 bln yuan of cash on its balance sheet, the newspaper said.
