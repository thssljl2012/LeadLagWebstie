NEW YORK - By Lilla Zuill  American International Group Inc  Chief Executive Edward Liddy will receive $1 in salary this year and next, and there will be no 2008 bonuses for the company's seven most senior executives, the troubled insurance conglomerate said on Tuesday.  Fifty more AIG executives will be locked out of pay raises in 2009, AIG said in a statement.  The salary and bonus curbs follow New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo earlier this month asking AIG for full disclosure on plans for executive bonuses and pay increases.  Wall Street firms that have taken federal bailouts must put limits on executive salary and bonus payments. AIG said the restrictions it was putting in place exceeded those required.  Liddy, who joined AIG at the time of its September bailout by the U.S. government, is also forgoing any severance payment should he leave the company.  'We believe these actions demonstrate that we are focused on overcoming our financial challenges so AIG can return value to taxpayers and shareholders,' Liddy said in the statement.  Cuomo called the stance AIG had adopted 'appropriate, and I encourage other firms to wake up to the new reality on Wall Street and follow AIG's step quickly.'  The cost of the United States' rescue of AIG, which nearly collapsed under bad mortgage bets, ballooned to $152 billion earlier this month. AIG is currently trying to sell off assets to repay part of the federal debt.  The company's shares have lost nearly all their value since the beginning of the year. The stock was 2.3 percent lower at $1.73 in midday New York Stock Exchange trading.
