This is a fluid situation, but I can assure you that the insurance companies owned by AIG are in good financial shape and capable of paying claims.Regardless of what happens to AIG, there is a firewall in place that guards the assets of the insurance companies and protects policyholders. The parent company cannot move assets upstream without the approval of state insurance regulators.If you have a policy through an AIG insurance company whether its an auto policy, homeowner policy or even an annuity  your coverage is safe. Do not cancel your policy or cash in your annuity.State regulators have made sure that the insurance companies have the money necessary to pay claims. And if the financial condition of AIG takes a turn for the worse, we have the authority to prevent AIG from raiding its insurance companies. Even under the worst case scenario, policyholders claims will be paid.In Washington, AIGs insurance companies sell homeowner, auto, and life insurance as well as annuity products. If AIG declares bankruptcy, the states where each insurance company is based would likely place the company in receivership  not because the insurer is financially troubled, but to protect its assets from the parent company.In the very unlikely event that the insurance companies were ordered to liquidate, Washington policyholders claims would be paid by one of Washingtons two guaranty associations.If youre unsure whether your insurance company is owned by AIG, call our Insurance Consumer Hotline at 1-800-562-6900.
