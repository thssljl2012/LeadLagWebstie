In a dramatic move early today the U.S. Federal Reserve stepped in to save one of the world's biggest insurance companies from going under.Just 24 hours after US officials hinted Washington would not intervene to save threatened financial institutions, the Federal Reserve has agreed to provide a 43billion loan to American Insurance Group.The deal will give the Federal Reserve an 80 per cent stake in AIG, which employs 116,000 around the world, including 2,000 in the UK.The US central bank has stepped in to save insurance giant AIG with a 43billion loanIt also sells insurance through high street names such as Argos and Boots and underwrites product warranties for John Lewis department stores.Early this morning the New York Times reported all of AIGs assets would be pledged to secure the 43billion loan and in return, the Federal Reserve would receive warrants that would give it an ownership stake. Stock of existing shareholders would be diluted, but not wiped out.If the Federal Reserve takes a controlling stake, it is likely that it would want to replace AIGs board as well as its chief executive and chairman, Robert B. Willumstad.The dramatic move would mirror the way the Federal Reserve stepped in two weeks ago to run America's two biggest mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.As final details were thrashed out in New York, shares in the company were temporarily suspended when trading opened on the Tokyo stock market this morning.The Nikkei average rose 0.9 per cent from a three-year low yesterday after the AIG bailout.But Japan, Australia and India pumped 18.5billion into money markets as investors' jitters persisted over the crisis engulfing Wall Street.Hong Kong shares reversed early gains with China's top bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, falling nearly five per cent and market heavyweight HSBC Holdings down 1.5 percent.Australian shares gave up all their gains and fell 0.8 per cent.The future of AIG had hung in the balance last night amid fears that a multi-billion dollar rescue package might fail to materialise.Its funding crisis made the Lehman Brothers debacle look trivial by comparison.If AIG went under - which had been a real possibility after losing more than 43 per cent in its share value earlier this week - the consequences for the financial markets would be unimaginable.Many in the City feared that it would precipitate the collapse of other finance institutions, most likely investment banks, across the globe.And the impact would have been felt at home because AIG is believed to be the second biggest player in the British local authority insurers' market.Manchester United have a sponsorship deal with AIGIt is also the biggest life insurer. However, because it is regulated by the Financial Services Authority, the group's millions of policyholders in this country should all be protected.It writes 12million policies a year in Britain alone and in 2007 won new business worth 10.7billion for its life, pensions, protection and investment policies in the British market.In addition to the financial ramifications which would be felt across the world, 2,000 British jobs were also on the line. AIG has 11 offices in the UK, including its City headquarters.Globally, more than 116,000 work for the insurance giant.AIG operates under three main brands in the UK - AIG UK, AIG Life and AIG Direct.AIG is a specialist in the UK business insurance market and boasts more than half the top 1,000 British companies as clients.It is particularly big in the commercial property sector, providing insurance for such varied risks as rental income on commercial property and employers' liability.However, the group is best known in the UK for its sponsorship of Manchester United.It signed a 56.5million agreement with the club in 2006, the biggest shirt sponsorship deal in English football.Add your comments View allComments (2)Here's what readers have had to say so far.
