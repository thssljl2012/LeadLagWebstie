Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty said today it appears AIG's troubles will have little impact on Florida's insurance market.The news we are continuing to hear is that the primary financial problem is with the AIG holding companies, not the insurance companies, and that the holding company issue is being resolved by the $85 billion loan from the federal government,' McCarty said. 'We have been told that the insurance companies are solvent and will be able to pay claims. It is important that policyholders continue to pay their premiums to ensure that their coverage does not lapse.' AIG has 46 subsidiaries operating in Florida -- 34 that sell property and casualty insurance and 12 that sell life and health insurance -- but it is not a major player in the state. One AIG company, American General Property Insurance Co. of Florida, is headquartered in the state.
