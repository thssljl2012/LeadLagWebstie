State Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo, who helped hammer out a government deal to rescue AIG behind the scenes, began playing an expanded public role yesterday in overseeing the sale of some of the insurer's assets.As the Federal Reserve has stepped in with an $85-billion loan to prevent the bankruptcy of AIG, the world's largest insurer, Dinallo is heading a working group created by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a voluntary organization of the states' insurance regulators based in Kansas City, Mo.The group, currently being put together, will streamline the complicated process of the sale and regulatory approval of AIG's divisions, Dinallo said in an interview yesterday. 'We're trying to create a template and make sure that we as regulators make it efficient and practical.' Dinallo, of Manhattan, was tapped to head the insurance department in April 2007, by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who was previously the state attorney general. As chief of Spitzer's investment protection bureau in the attorney general's office, Dinallo was the architect behind many of Spitzer's Wall Street investigations.The state Insurance Department is the chief regulator of AIG's insurance divisions. Dinallo said, 'The reason that we needed the bridge loan from the federal government was so that we didn't have to sell stuff at ridiculous prices in a rushed way.' Top state and federal officials said the AIG deal was made in hopes of staving off further turmoil in the financial markets and the economy.Dinallo said major companies have expressed interest in buying the assets of AIG: 'There have been some really top-tier companies that are interested in the core assets of the company.' Dinallo said he was 'very pleased' at the government's selection of Edward Liddy, former Allstate Corp. chief executive, as AIG's new chief executive. Dinallo called Liddy a 'platinum-level insurance executive.'
