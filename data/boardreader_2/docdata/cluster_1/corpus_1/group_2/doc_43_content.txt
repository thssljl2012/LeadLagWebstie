(The Idaho Statesman - McClatchy-Tribune News Service via COMTEX) -- AIG   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- Sep. 20--The Idaho Department of Insurance says it has joined forces with other state insurance regulators to protect policyholders of American International Group's insurance companies.This oversight will continue as AIG operates under the $85 billion credit facility offered by the Federal Reserve. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has established a working group to oversee AIG insurance interests and to coordinate with federal regulators as needed.'Idahoans should rest assured that the department is aware of this situation and is working with AIG and other regulators to protect their interests,' said Director Bill Deal. 'AIG's insurance companies are solvent and able to pay their obligations.'Claims from individual policyholders receive priority over other creditors in the event an insurer fails, the department said. If company assets are not sufficient to cover claims, the state guaranty fund provides coverage, subject to certain limits, similar to the federal coverage for bank accounts.To see more of the Idaho Statesman, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.idahostatesman.com Copyright (c) 2008, The Idaho Statesman, Boise Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Information Services.
