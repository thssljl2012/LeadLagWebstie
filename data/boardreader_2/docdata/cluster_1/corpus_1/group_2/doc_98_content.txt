City officials say the new $20 million AIG headquarters will be built regardless of its parent companies' financial woes.  The U.S. government agreed late Tuesday to provide an $85 billion emergency loan to rescue the huge insurance company.Dan McGinnity, spokesman for AIG Travel Guard, said as of today, construction is ahead of schedule on the new 175,000-square-foot headquarters, and the company plans to move into the building next June.'I think the important thing to remember is AIG is not building this building,' said Mayor Andrew Halverson. 'We have protections in place to make sure the project is completed.'TOLD Development Company is the developer for the project. Messages to company officials were not returned Tuesday.CNN reported that shares of American International Group fell 21 percent Tuesday, with the last sale being $3.75 per share.McGinnity said AIG Travel Guard's policies are underwritten by member companies of AIG Commercial Insurance, which have substantial capital independent of parent company AIG Inc. He said AIG Commercial Insurance remains well-capitalized, with a statutory $26.7 billion surplus.McGinnity said regardless of action taken by a parent company, the company can remain intact, have the assets to pay claims and have the capital to underwrite and sell travel insurance policies.John Noel, CEO of AIG Travel Guard, released a statement Monday saying the company has a deep asset base, with stakeholders' equity of $79.9 billion and assets of more than $1 trillion.A stipulation in the developers' agreement says AIG Travel Guard will purchase the real estate, Halverson said, but he would not speculate on occupancy of the building if AIG declared bankruptcy. He said there is 'no reason to believe' the timeline put forth would not be met.Halverson said he and AIG officials have an 'open dialogue,' and said officials have been upfront and honest with him.'I cannot tell you what that would mean to the city of Stevens Point,' he said about a possible bankruptcy of AIG's parent company. 'Ultimately, we are on the sidelines.'
