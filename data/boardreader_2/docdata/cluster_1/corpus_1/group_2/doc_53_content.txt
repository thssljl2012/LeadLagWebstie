Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRESCHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- American International Group (AIG) said Friday that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA, BRKB) will reinsure the real estate insurance business operated by AIG subsidiary Lexington Insurance Co. The deal could reassure big real estate customers whose lenders often require that insurance carry a top credit rating.'In the event of a covered loss, Berkshire stands behind Lexington,' said the statement. News of Buffett's involvement seemed to help drive up AIG's share price Friday by 4% before it pulled back to unchanged at $3.02.'This enhances Lexington's value to its policyholders,' said George Stratts, executive vice president of Lexington and head of its property division.After AIG's credit rating was cut to the single-A range by ratings agencies in recent weeks, some customers asked for alternatives to AIG coverage, according to insurance brokers and rival insurers. Berkshire Hathaway's triple-A rating could help AIG keep more of that business.AIG did not disclose all the terms of the deal, such as how much it will pay Berkshire for the coverage and how extensive the coverage is.The deal has Berkshire Hathaway's National Indemnity Co. provide a contingent property reinsurance cover for Lexington's real estate portfolio, along with policies having limits of $250 million or more, policies with home and foreign exposure, and the property sections of most of its homeowners insurance business.The deal could also give some insight into a potential Buffett interest in Lexington, which is AIG's largest U.S.-based surplus lines insurer and a key part of AIG's insurance business. Buffett has said in recent interviews that he has looked into buying one or two units of AIG in the past few weeks, but did not have time to complete any deals.A reinsurance expert said that writing an extensive reinsurance contract would put Buffett in a position to know as much about Lexington as AIG's investment bankers would know.'When you underwrite reinsurance, you do the same work as if you are buying the company,' said Andrew Barile, a Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., reinsurance consultant.
