North Dakota's insurance commissioner says the AIG insurance companies that do business here are running normally. Adam Hamm says AIG has 20 property and casualty insurers licensed to do business in North Dakota. There are 11 life and health insurance companies. Hamm says the companies collected $66.8 million in North Dakota premiums last year. Nationally, AIG insurers collected more than $151 billion in premiums. Hamm says AIG's main holding company is the business that's having severe financial problems. The federal government has loaned $85 billion to the holding company. Hamm says the AIG insurers in North Dakota are in business and paying claims. He says any policyholder with concerns should call their insurance agent or the state Insurance Department. The holding company could end up selling its insurance subsidiaries.
