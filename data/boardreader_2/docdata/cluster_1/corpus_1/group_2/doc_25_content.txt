Eric Dinallo, head of the state Insurance Department, pronounced the insurance companies of American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG) to be strong and solvent on Monday. AIG became financially fragile last week after Standard &amp;amp; Poors lowered its investments ratings of AIG by several levels. The federal government gave AIG an $85 billion revolving loan on Sept. 16.That negated the need for the state to follow through on a deal it had previously made with AIG. State regulators had agreed to approve a move by AIG to take $20 billion in assets from its insurance subsidiaries and use that as collateral to raise sufficient amounts of liquid cash. AIGs insurance companies are financially sound, with substantially more in assets than they need to pay all valid present and projected claims, Dinallo said in a statement. The AIG insurance companies are strong and solvent. AIG is the worlds largest insurance company, based in New York City. Dinallo said most of AIGs financial troubles were caused by AIGs parent company, which is not involved in insurance and thus not regulated by the state.Dinallo said state regulators have ensured that the assets of AIGs insurance companies are walled off and protected from the financial troubles of its parent company.The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has tapped Dinallo to head a new group created to oversee AIGs insurance interests. The oversight will continue through the two-year existence of AIGs revolving loan with the Federal Reserve.
