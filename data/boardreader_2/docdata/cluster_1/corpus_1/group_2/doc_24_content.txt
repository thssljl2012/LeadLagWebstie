 CHARLOTTE, N.C.  The New York Insurance Department said Thursday that American International Group Inc., under pressure to raise funds to pay off an $85 billion federal loan, will need regulatory approval before it can sell off any of its business units.  It is critical to ensure policyholders' interests are protected during this process, said New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo in a statement. The state regulator said it had hired boutique investment bank Centerview Partners to advise it on the terms of any potential AIG sales. Late Tuesday, the New York-based insurer said it signed a definitive agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a two-year, $85 billion emergency loan at an interest rate of about 11.5 percent. AIG had teetered on the edge of failure because of stresses caused by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the credit crunch that ensued. Shortly after AIG struck its deal with the government last week, it announced former Allstate Corp. Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy was taking over as chairman and chief executive. Liddy replaced Robert Willumstad, who took over the company in June. Liddy has said he plans to quickly raise funds through asset sales, but hopes to hold on to as many of AIG's insurance operations as he can. AIG operates a range of insurance and financial services businesses ranging from property, casualty, auto and life insurance to annuity and investment services. Shares of AIG fell 29 cents, or 8.8 percent, to close at $3.02 Thursday.
