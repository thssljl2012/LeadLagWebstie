Mumbai: Global financial markets continued to be in turmoil for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Even before the fact of the major U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers going bankrupt could be digested and its repercussions fully understood, the markets faced an even larger crisis that loomed over Americas largest insurer by assets, American International Group (AIG). The insurer, which has accumulated $18.5 billion in losses over the last nine months, will need $70 billion to $75 billion in capital if it is not to go the way of Lehman. With the U.S. Federal Reserve in no mood to offer support, AIG was left pleading for private capital to save itself. AIG stock was down in early trading in New York. New York Governor David Paterson said AIG had just one day to raise up to $80 billion to stave off bankruptcy. Indias Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority on Tuesday asked the two insurance joint ventures where AIG partners the Tata group  Tata AIG Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and Tata AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd.  to submit status reports on their business.The Indian stock market fell sharply in the morning but recovered in the afternoon to close not much lower than on Monday. Leading the pack of losers was ICICI Bank, whose stock fell 5.7 per cent to Rs. 591.65. The bank said it was providing another $28 million (about Rs. 140 crore) to cover potential losses from its U.K. unit that holds bonds issued by Lehman Brothers. The rupee fell to Rs 46.90 a dollar, its lowest level in two years, following worries over capital outflows from share sales by foreign institutional investors. And the Reserve Bank asked Lehman Brothers NBFC and primary dealer arms not to remit money in forex without its approval.
