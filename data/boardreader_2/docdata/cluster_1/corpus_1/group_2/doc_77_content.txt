The federal government's unprecedented decision to rescue giant insurance company American International Group, known as AIG, is surely a relief to West Virginia state agencies and individual insurance policyholders alike.On Tuesday, the federal government seized control of the insurer when it gave AIG an $85 billion loan in return for an 80 percent stake in the company.AIG has a contract with the West Virginia Board of Risk and Insurance Management, also known as BRIM, to provide liability insurance for state agencies.Charles 'Chuck' Jones, director of the board, is attending a conference and was unavailable for comment Tuesday and this morning. However, through Department of Administration spokeswoman Diane Holley, Jones said today that there are safeguards in place in BRIM's contract with AIG for various scenarios that may occur during the life of the contract, whether it be bankruptcy or any other situation.In a worst-case scenario -- the bankruptcy of AIG -- the West Virginia Insurance Guaranty Association would insure policyholders.The association pays the insurance policy claims of West Virginia policyholders when an insurance company is placed into liquidation. The association is funded by assessments on carriers that operate in the state.Jones said through Holley, 'Since AIG is subject to the Guaranty Fund and safeguards are in place within the contract, BRIM would hope that the ramifications would be minimal.'Holley said BRIM is closely monitoring the situation with AIG 'and will react accordingly as the situation develops.'Jason Butcher, spokesman for West Virginia Insurance Commissioner Jane Cline, said Tuesday, 'The commissioner wishes to state that our chief concern is to protect West Virginia consumers and that is what we are working in concert with our fellow state regulators to ensure.'The federal government's unprecedented decision to rescue giant insurance company American International Group, known as AIG, is surely a relief to West Virginia state agencies and individual insurance policyholders alike.On Tuesday, the federal government seized control of the insurer when it gave AIG an $85 billion loan in return for an 80 percent stake in the company.AIG has a contract with the West Virginia Board of Risk and Insurance Management, also known as BRIM, to provide liability insurance for state agencies.Charles 'Chuck' Jones, director of the board, is attending a conference and was unavailable for comment Tuesday and this morning.

She pointed out that all of the states have guaranty funds to provide a backstop for insurance policyholders.Butcher said AIG writes property and casualty insurance, life and annuity, and workers' compensation insurance in West Virginia.AIG has 4.7 percent of the life and annuity business in West Virginia. That amounts to 4,067 policies, Butcher said. The No. 1 life and annuity provider in the state is Hartford, which has a 9.46 percent market share.AIG has 2.7 percent of the property and casualty insurance business in the state. Butcher could not immediately say how many individual policies that percentage figure represents. AIG is No. 8 in the state in market share, he said.BrickStreet Mutual Insurance Co., which was the sole provider of workers' compensation insurance in the state up until July 1, is the No. 1 provider in the property and casualty insurance category in West Virginia. BrickStreet has a 23 percent market share, Butcher said.All of the percentages and numbers are as of Dec. 31, 2007, Butcher said.AIG began writing workers' compensation insurance in West Virginia on July 1, when the state market opened to competition. Butcher said it's too early to know how much of that market AIG has captured.
