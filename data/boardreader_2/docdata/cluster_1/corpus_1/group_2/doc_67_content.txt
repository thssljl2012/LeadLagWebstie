ssociated Press BOISE - The Idaho Department of Insurance is working with insurance regulators in other states to look out for the interests of American International Group Inc.'s policyholders. The financial giant's poor health prompted the Federal Reserve to provide an $85 billion bailout loan. Idaho Department of Insurance Director Bill Deal says AIG's insurance companies are solvent and able to pay their obligations. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners says AIG is unlikely to fail. But even if that were to happen, the group says policyholders would be paid before other creditors. Officials say if there isn't enough money to satisfy all claims, states maintain backup funds to protect consumers.
