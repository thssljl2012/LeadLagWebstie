INTERNATIONAL. Shares in American International Group plummeted more than 50% Monday on fears the US insurance giant could be the next domino to fall in the worst banking crisis to shake Wall Street since the Great Depression.AIG, saddled with toxic mortgage-backed derivatives and facing the imminent threat of a ratings downgrade, had reportedly turned to the US Federal Reserve for US$40 billion in bridge financing, according to the New York Times.Over the weekend, AIG executives reportedly met with New York state insurance regulators to look into ways to bolster its liquidity.New York Governor David Paterson said Monday afternoon he and other state officials had reached an agreement with American International Group that allows the insurer access to US$20 billion of its own capital, staving off a liquidity crisis.Under the plan, AIG will be able to shift the funds from its insurance subsidiaries to the parent company.The move buys AIG time to negotiate for help from the Federal Reserve, Paterson said today at a New York City press conference.AIG shares were earlier down 58.98% at 4.20pm GMT Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, its shares are down 90%.AIG, the largest insurer in the United States, and until recently, the largest worldwide, has this year posted losses of US$18 billion from guarantees it wrote on mortgage-backed derivatives.AIG has already had to write down US$25 billion in 'credit default swaps' (CDS) depreciation because of the drop in real estate values that they are pegged to.Unlike other insurers, AIG finds itself in the thick of the current crisis because of the high volume of credit fault swaps it has issued.Credit default swaps are complex derivatives that insure investors against payment defaults by a bond issuer. They have created a complex intertwining between the ailing financial institutions, and exacerbated the current crisis.According to a US Securities and Exchange filing, the company had an exposure of US$441 million worth of the instruments as of 30 June 2008.The New York-based company has a global reach. The company's founder, Cornelius Vander Starr, formed an insurance company called American Asiatic Underwriters, in Shanghai in 1919, years before he founded a company in New York in 1926 that would become part of AIG.The company is also the largest sponsor of the Manchester United soccer club, having signed a US$101.2 million deal with the club in 2006.AIG has 74 million customers in 130 countries.Paterson said he had worked with AIG in a bid to help save New York jobs, with the insurer employing 6,000 in Manhattan and 8,600 statewide. He added that the plan was carefully crafted to pose no risk to New York taxpayers.New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo is appealing to the federal government on AIG's behalf to provide it additional access to capital, Paterson said.
