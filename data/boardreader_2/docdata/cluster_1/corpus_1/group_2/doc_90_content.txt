Despite the meltdown, bailout and likely dismantling of insurance giant AIG, Kansas insurance customers need not worry that their annuity checks won't come or their claims won't get paid, the state's top insurance official said.AIG operates under more than 30 names in Kansas and writes more than $200 million in premiums a year, according to state Insurance Department records.But the units offering insurance are all subsidiaries of the parent company and maintain their own reserves to pay claims, Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger said Wednesday.The subsidiaries' financial health won't be hurt by the parent company's disastrous forays into high-risk mortgage investment insurance, Praeger said.On Wednesday, the federal government rescued AIG with an $85 billion line of credit and took on the right to exercise control over the company.Federal regulators will probably force the sale of insurance subsidiaries and put the proceeds toward paying off AIG's bad debt, Praeger said.But 'any transaction like that would have to go to the state regulators' in the state where the subsidiary is based, she said.They would require any company that buys an AIG subsidiary to take on all of its responsibilities to policyholders, she said.For customers, that means 'the (company) name on the checks may change, but the checks will still come,' Praeger said.Regulations nationwide require that companies maintain a 250 percent reserve, she said.Essentially, that means the subsidiaries have to have about $250 in assets on their balance sheets for every $100 they put at risk, said Praeger, who also serves as president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.Insurers can get licenses to sell policies across state lines, but all state regulators follow the same rules -- and rely on each other -- to audit companies and ensure they remain solvent, she said.If reserves drop below the required levels or the company appears to be otherwise mismanaged, the state insurance office can take action up to taking control of the company, Praeger said.Malcolm Harris, a professor of finance at Friends University, agreed with Praeger that insurance customers aren't at risk of seeing their policies and benefits go away.But he said they may lose their human contact at the insurance firms they deal with.'I think what they want to worry about is the people they deal with day to day may lose their jobs,' he said.AIG could lay off insurance employees to increase profits, or a buyer might shift the policies handled by AIG personnel to its own people, he said.Praeger also said the Wall Street crisis should put some brakes on efforts to reduce insurance regulation.Some have argued that insurance companies should be allowed to charter nationally and bypass state controls.'If anything good's going to come out of this, it's even stronger (regulatory authority) in terms of states,' she said.She said she couldn't see how anyone can credibly argue for loosening state controls, after the federal regulatory shortfalls exposed by the financial crisis on Wall Street.'It was the lack of good regulation that made it happen,' she said.Reach Dion Lefler at 316-268-6527.
