  (BestWire Services Via Acquire Media NewsEdge) Despite challenges to its capitalization, American International Group said Sept. 16 that its life insurance, general insurance and retirement services businesses, including its extensive Asian operations, continue to operate normally and remain adequately capitalized and fully capable of meeting their obligations to policyholders.        In a statement released after close of trading, AIG said it continues to pursue alternatives to increase short-term liquidity in the parent company.Earlier in the day, former Chief Executive Officer Maurice 'Hank'' Greenberg and a small group of investors filed notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the group is considering an array of options concerning their investment in AIG (NYSE: AIG). Greenberg owns approximately 11% of AIG, through personal holdings and companies that he controls.        The filing said the group is considering a variety of options as part of the ongoing review of AIG?s 'business, operations, financial condition and underlying value' begun earlier this year when one of the companies Greenberg controls, C.V. Starr, hired investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP as a financial adviser regarding AIG (BestWire, Jan. 18, 2008). The filing said the group could consider buying AIG assets, including one or more of its subsidiaries, making loans 'or other financings' to the company, or 'seeking to acquire control ? through a merger, proxy solicitation, tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise' or by 'participating in a 'going-private' transaction.' The group also said it may make recommendations to AIG leadership.The state of New York is permitting AIG to use up to $20 billion in assets from its subsidiaries to provide collateral and maintain daily operations (BestWire, Sept. 15, 2008).In its statement, AIG said its plans do not include any effort to reduce the capital of any of its subsidiaries or to tap into Asian operations for liquidity. 'The insurance policies written by AIG companies are direct obligations of its regulated subsidiary insurance companies around the world. These companies are well capitalized and meet or exceed local regulatory capital requirements. The companies continue to operate in the normal course to meet obligations to policyholders.' Additionally, AIG said it is fully committed to maintaining required capital levels in all of its subsidiaries and to meeting the needs of their customers around the world.A.M. Best Co. on Sept. 15 downgraded AIG?s Financial Strength Rating to A (Excellent) from A+ (Superior) based on concern over ?AIG?s lack of liquidity at the holding company level and management?s need to secure funding options.? AIG?s ratings and under review status will be reviewed as AIG executes its plans to stabilize its financial condition.(By Alyn Ackermann, senior associate editor, BestWeek: Alyn.Ackermann@ambest.com)Copyright ? 2008 A.M.
