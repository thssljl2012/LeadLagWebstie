American Insurance Group is paying out millions of dollars in bonuses after receiving a taxpayer bailout of more than $170-billion.  The Treasury Department has determined the US government did not have the legal authority to block the current payments by the American insurance group.  A white paper prepared by AIG says the company is contractually obligated to pay a total of $165-million of previously awarded 'retention pay' to employees by Sunday.  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner asked AIG to scale back future bonus payments where legally possible. AIG agreed to the request.
