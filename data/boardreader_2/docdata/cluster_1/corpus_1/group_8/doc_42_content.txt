A man leaves AIG offices in New York. American International Group Inc., once the world's largest insurer, said Monday that it lost $61.7 billion in the fourth quarter, the biggest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate history, amid continued financial market turmoil.  Help wanted  On Monday the government provided additional support to American International Group Inc., the battered insurance company. AIG also posted a $61.7 billion quarterly loss, the worst in U.S. history. The following is a timeline of the government's support for the New York-based company.  --Sept. 16, 2008  The Federal Reserve provides AIG with up to $85 billion in an emergency two-year loan. In return, the government gets a 79.9 percent stake in the company and the right to remove senior management.  --Oct. 8, 2008  The Federal Reserve provides AIG with an additional loan of up to $37.8 billion. Under that plan, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would borrow up to $37.8 billion in investment-grade, fixed income securities from AIG in return for cash collateral.  --Nov. 10, 2008  U.S. government restructures its loans to AIG, giving the company a total of about $150 billion to help it remain in business as the credit crisis deepens. That package replaced earlier loans after it became apparent the insurer needed more funds.  --March 2, 2009  AIG receives a fresh $30 billion infusion from the government's $700 billion financial rescue fund that it can draw upon as needed. AIG's credit line with the Fed was also cut to roughly $25 billion from $60 billion.
