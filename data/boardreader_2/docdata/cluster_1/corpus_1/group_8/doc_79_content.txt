(A. M. Best via COMTEX News Network) --   South Korea's AIG Life Insurance, a life subsidiary of American International Group Inc. [18540], has experienced soaring policy lapse and surrender since the financial woes of its parent company became apparent in September 2008.   AIG Life saw a 166.1% surge in policy cancellations last September, with a total face value of 1.6 trillion won (US$1.04 billion), according to the Korea Life Insurance Association.   In October, AIG Life's total value on policy cancellations amounted 998.9 billion won, up 64.8% from a year earlier. Total value of policy lapses and surrenders stood at 645.3 billion won in November and 846.9 billion won in December, according to the life association's statistics.   Last week, the insurer said in a statement that AIG Life Insurance in South Korea will separate from the troubled U.S. parent group and plans to change its name to AIA.
