The U.S. government is set to announce its fourth bailout for 'the blackhole', also known as American International Group (NYSE: AIG).  According to various reports, the insurer, which bet unwisely in the mortgage market, will receive revamped terms of the government bailout and $30 billion in additional capital as the company is set to announce a $60 billion quarterly loss - the largest loss in corporate history.  In addition, AIG will repay billions owed to the Fed with equity stakes in Asia-based American International Assurance Co. and American Life Insurance Co. instead of cash.  AIG is also expected to combine its U.S. and foreign property-casualty insurance operations into a new unit, which would be taken public.  Major credit-rating companies signed off on the latest package, which potentially saved AIG from posting another $8 billion in collateral to its counter parties.  AIG was too big to fail and now the money we've given it is too much to let it go. The scam-artists at AIG have successfully transfered the insanely risky bets they made onto the U.S. taxpayer. A complete and utter disgrace!Here is the  - funny until you realize that it's our money.
