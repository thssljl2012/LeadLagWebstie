WASHINGTON (Reuters)U.S. regulators failed to spot how much risk insurer American International Group Inc. was piling on, and by the time they understood, they had no choice but to pour in tens of billions of taxpayer dollars, officials said Thursday.  The fact that a 'multitude of regulators' of AIG missed the warning signs highlights the need for regulatory reform, Scott Polakoff, acting director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, told the Senate Banking Committee.  'Where OTS fell short, as did others, was in the failure to recognize in time the extent of the liquidity risk to AIG' of certain credit default swaps held in the portfolio of the company's financial products division.  That unit, although a small part of the global insurance giant's worldwide operations, racked up such heavy losses that it threatened the entire company's survival, eventually forcing the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to launch a series of costly bailouts.  Under a revised bailout deal announced Monday, the amount of funds committed to help AIG increased to about $180 billion, although the insurer has not tapped it all and plans to pay back roughly $38 billion soon. The U.S. government holds about an 80% stake in the insurer.  AIG sold insurance-like protection, known as credit default swaps, against declines in the value of securitiesincluding subprime mortgages that began defaulting at an alarming rate when the housing market tumbled.  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said earlier this week that the unit operated like an unregulated hedge fund, and he expressed anger that its risky behavior put taxpayers on the hook.
