The United States insurance giant AIG has posted a record quarterly loss of 62 billion dollars, just as it received fresh commitments of federal funds. The US government has offered AIG a further 30 billion dollars following a massive bailout last year in which the state gained a nearly-80-percent stake in the company. The US Treasury and Federal Reserve said in a joint statement the restructured aid package sought to avert a potentially catastrophic collapse of what was until recently the world's biggest insurer. AIG insured many lenders for the kinds of toxic assets which have imploded in value amid the financial crisis. The government has now made four separate efforts to save the company, totalling more than 170 billion dollars.
