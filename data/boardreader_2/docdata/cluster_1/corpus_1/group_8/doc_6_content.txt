 China Life Insurance, the largest domestic insurer, has confirmed that it is not bidding for American International Assurance, the Asian life insurance subsidiary of the financially-hit AIG, according to AM Best.  China Life said last week that it found AIG's investment proposal inappropriate to its own investment directions.  AIG had sought out and invited China Life in the bidding for AIA, as the American insurance group is selling its assets to raise funds to repay debt.  On Monday, the US government said it was giving AIG another bailout loan amounting to US$30 billion, taking total government aid to the insurer to US$180 billion since last September. The announcement was made as AIG declared a fourth-quarter loss of US$61.7 billion, the largest in corporate history.  In turn, AIG is handing a preferred interest in AIA and another life insurance subsidiary - American Life Insurance - to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
