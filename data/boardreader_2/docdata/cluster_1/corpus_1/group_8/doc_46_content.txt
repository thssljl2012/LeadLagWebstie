The U.S. government has unveiled a revamped rescue package for insurance giant American International Group (AIG) that will provide the troubled company with an additional $30 billion on an 'as needed' basis.The U.S. Treasury said Monday AIG will repay the government with equity stakes in two of its Asia-based units.  The transaction will help AIG pay off some of the $40 billion it has drawn from its government line of credit and offset its quarterly losses.  The company announced a fourth-quarter loss of more than $60 billion on Monday.  That loss is the largest corporate loss in history, despite two previous government bailouts totaling $150 billion. The government owns an 80 percent stake in AIG, which suffered major losses last year in investments linked to the housing market.
