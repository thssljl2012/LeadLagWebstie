The U.S. government has again propped up insurance giant AIG. It's the fourth time the government has intervened to save the company. The question is whether an additional $30 billion, on top of the $150 billion already committed, will be enough to save the company. Some analysts believe government aid to AIG will peak at $250 billion.
