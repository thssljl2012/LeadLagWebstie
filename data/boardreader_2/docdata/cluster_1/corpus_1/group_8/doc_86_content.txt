The restructured legal entity may consider an initial public offering in Hong Kong. AIA has 20 million consumers, 20,000 employees and 250,000 agents in 13 countries and territories in Asia.  In Malaysia, it is business as usual with RHB Bank announcing a 10-year exclusive tie-up with AIA Bhd to sell AIA's conventional life insurance products via the RHB Bank distribution network.
