The insurance firm AIG could be set to receive another $30bn in taxpayers' money in a fourth bailout by the US Government.  The firm is expected to announce $60bn quarterly losses today.  AIG has already received around $150bn in loans from the US Government, which currently owns an 80% stake in the company.  Commentators say the firm is too large to be allowed to fail.
