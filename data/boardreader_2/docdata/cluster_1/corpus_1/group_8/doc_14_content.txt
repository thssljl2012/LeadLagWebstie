US INSURANCE giant AIG is to receive up to an additional $US30 billion ($46 billion) dollars in Federal Assistance in the latest overhaul of its Government bailout, US media reported. Under the new plan, American International Group, is to repay most of the $US40 billion dollars it owes the Federal Reserve with equity stakes in two of its overseas units, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The units were American International Assurance, which is based in Asia, and American Life Insurance, which operates in 50 countries.  AIG was originally supposed to repay the Federal Reserve in cash with interest.  The New York-based company, already set to announce a fourth-quarter loss of some $US60 billion, would also convert between $US5 and $US10 billion in debt into securities, backed with life insurance assets.  The $US60 billion Federal Reserve credit that AIG received in November, from which the company has already withdrawn $US40 billion, would then be reduced to $US25 billion.  The newspaper said AIG's board met to vote on the plan and was 'expected to give its approval.'' 'Major credit rating agencies have already signed off on the deal,'' it added.  The US government bailed out AIG for more than $US150 billion last year after a home mortgage crisis that sent shock waves across the global financial markets.  The bailout plan was the largest in US history and came as AIG burned through billions of dollars of cash and reported a third-quarter loss of $US24.47 billion.
