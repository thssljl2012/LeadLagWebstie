U.S. insurance giant AIG said it lost $61.65 billion in the fourth quarter, a sharp about-face from fourth quarter 2007, when the company gained $5.2 billion.  AIG Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy said AIG, already granted $150 billion in federal bailout funds, 'made meaningful progress in addressing liquidity issues.'
