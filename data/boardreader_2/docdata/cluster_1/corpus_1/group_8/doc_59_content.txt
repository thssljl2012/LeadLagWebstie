The AIG Life Insurance Vietnam (AIG Life Vietnam) company has announced that it will remain a subsidiary of the American International Assurance (AIA) Co Ltd despite AIGs move to restructure its business operations.  The American International Group, known as AIG, has decided to separate the Asia-based AIA into an independent business component in an effort to reinstate its position in the Asian region amid the world financial crunch.  AIG Life Vietnam is a 100 percent foreign-owned life insurance company, the first American life insurer to operate in Vietnam since August 2000, offering a wide range of life insurance products and services.
