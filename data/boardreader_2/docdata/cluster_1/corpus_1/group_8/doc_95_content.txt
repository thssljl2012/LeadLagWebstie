Insurance giant American International Group (AIG) has bowed to pressure from the Obama administration to cut salaries for top executives.   But the chairman Edward Liddy says AIG will still pay multi-million dollar bonuses for 2008 because the Government does not have the legal authority to block them.  AIG has received three government bailouts totalling $270 billion since last year.  After pumping some $US150 billion ($228 billion) into the crippled insurance giant, the US Government earlier this month unveiled an additional rescue plan worth $US30 billion.  The plan, which saw the Government take a major equity stake in the firm, was billed as an effort to stave off the collapse of what had been the world's biggest insurer.
