 Kaka has set his heart on a shock transfer to Chelsea, according to his advisor.A report claims the FIFA World Player of the Year was the subject of discussions between the Barclays Premier League club and the Brazilian's current employers, AC Milan, this week.'Real Madrid offered 90 million euros (71million) last summer and Milan did not even think about the bid,' Kaka's personal assistant Diogo Kotscho told The Guardian. 'This time is different. This is the first time we feel that a deal will definitely happen.'The Italians secured the signing of the Kaka's international team-mate Ronaldinho on Wednesday despite their well-publicised financial difficulties, and Kotscho is adamant all parties involved now want the deal to go through.If it did, Kaka would be reunited with Blues manager Luiz Felipe Scolari who handed him a Brazil debut in 2002 at the age of 20, and then included him in the squad that went on to win the World Cup that year.Kotscho added: 'Because of the situation Milan are in at the moment, the deal is good for all parties involved.'The move would represent a significant increase in Kaka's salary, on top of the 10% transfer fee that goes straight to the player anyway - some 15 million euros (12million).'Chelsea are the club to be at right now. They are building a team to win everything.'Any deal for arguably the planet's best player seems certain to break the world record transfer fee of 46million set when Real Madrid signed Zinedine Zidane from Juventus in 2001.Editors ChoiceCAN readers help a Kidderminster man identify Kidderminster footage on a 1950s film of the town?WEVE teamed up with our good friends at the Grand Theatre, Wolverhampton, to offer two readers a pair of tickets to Flashdance - The Musical on Monday, August 11.CALLING all Roary and Big Chris fans!
