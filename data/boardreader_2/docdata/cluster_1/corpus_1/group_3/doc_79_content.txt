MANILA, Philippines  (UPDATE) Troubled American Insurance Group (AIG) is to sell its local unit Philippine-American Life and General Insurance Co., the unit's chief executive Jose Cuisia said Monday.About 10 local and foreign entities have expressed interest in acquiring all or parts of the group, which is involved in insurance, banking and asset management, Cuisia told a news conference.He declined to give details and said he was not aware if there were others who had separately approached AIG's advisers Blackstone Group LP and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. with an offer.He said no time-frame had been set by AIG for the sale of the local unit known locally as Philamlife.Cuisia put the PhilamLife's net worth at P49.4 billion ($1.05 billion) as of end-2007.He said a few of the buyers expressed interest to acquire the Manila-based AIG PhilAm Savings Bank (AIGPASB) alone while most were keen on buying the whole group, Cuisia said.AIG Philam Savings Bank is jointly owned by AIG Consumer Finance Group and Philamlife.Other units of the Philamlife group, with total assets of P170 billion ($3.6 billion) are life insurance, general insurance, asset management and an outsourcing firm.AIG, once the world's largest insurer, was thrown a lifeline federal loan on Sept. 16 but the loan carries a high interest rate and fees and must be repaid in two years.Cuisia said Blackstone and J.P. Morgan would determine how Philamlife would be sold -- either as a block or separate units.Philamlife revenues reached P36.7 billion at end-2007, up 14 percent from a year ago.Cuisia said Philamlife's invested assets were placed in marketable Philippine government securities and corporate bonds, with only about 5.0 to 6.0 percent of its invested assets in Philippine equities.'AIG announced that it will refocus the company on its core property and casualty insurance business to repay its loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,' Cuisia said.He said he was 'surprised' with the decision, since Philamlife could be considered a 'crown jewel' to AIG.Philamlife is the Philippines' most profitable and largest insurer, employing about 1,500 people.'AIG is seeking top-rated, financially strong brand names with the capability to continue Philamlife's legacy of leadership, strength, stability and dedication, to its policy holders, employees and shareholders,' Cuisia said.'This is an opportunity for local companies to own a trophy company,' he said, citing PhilamLife's leading role in the local insurance industry.He said the company remains 'strongly capitalized' and would be able to meet all its commitments to depositors, investors and policy holders.Cuisia also said he was 'not leading a management buyout' of the company.Philamlife deputy president and chief operating officer Michel Khalaf said while the company will seek to retain all its employees, he said there could be some 'rationalization' if a buy-out led to duplication of jobs.
