(The Manila Times - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX) -- AYYLF   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- Ayala Corp. is willing to acquire the Philippine-American Life and General Insurance Co. (Philamlife) that is now being put on sale, Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, the chairman and chief executive of Ayala Corp., said Tuesday.Zobel added that the financial-services arena has always been of great interest to the company.He mentioned that American International Group (AIG) and its local unit Philamlife are exceptional institutions that have served the Philippines for many years.'Obviously, for different reasons, they decided to put that product in the market, [and] it makes sense that the Ayala group would be interested,' Zobel said.He added: Also 'if there are opportunities that crop up, we will be interested.'New York-based AIG wants to divest some of its prized stakes worldwide, including Philamlife, within the next nine months.Brian Murray, AIG's managing director for research in Asia, also on Tuesday said Philamlife along with other valuable assets of the world's largest insurer will be sold within six to nine months from now.Proceeds from the sale will be used to repay an $85-billion emergency facility from the US Federal Reserve.'The asset-sale process is going be about 6 to 9 months. We hope to do that sooner than later,' Murray told reporters on the sidelines of the Management Association of the Philippines International CEO conference in Makati City.Divestment was seen to save the AIG from bankruptcy on the back of massive losses on mortgage derivatives.Murray, however, declined to disclose the entities that have expressed interest in AIG's local unit.Panicky policyholdersJose Cuisia Jr., Philamlife president and chief executive, meanwhile, said that as of Tuesday, still close to 10 parties have shown interest in the country's largest insurer.Amid news of takeover, Cuisia added that some policyholders of Philamlife have already withdrawn their policies, but he assured that the number is less than 1 percent of the total number of policyholders of the insurance firm.To date, Philamlife has over a million policyholders in the Philippines.Cusia announced on Monday that potential buyers of Philamlife would pass through the wringer.Industry experts said big corporate names that might be interested and have the capacity to acquire Philamlife's assets are San Miguel Corp., Asia's biggest food and beverage company, and the Ayala group.Such buyers, Cuisia added, should be reputable and with strong financial standing and can provide employees with more growth prospects.He said: 'Some [potential buyers] will be cut off' from the shortlist if they fall short of the standards.About 10 interested entities, both foreign and domestic, including another major local insurance player, the Yuchengco group, have shown interest in acquiring AIG's business in the Philippines.Analysts said Philamlife may be too big for a single entity to digest.Cuisia, a former governor of the Philippines' central bank, said there might also be other potential buyers who have separately approached AIG's sale advisers J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. and Blackstone Group.The advisers would help AIG decide whether to sell Philamlife as a whole or part by part, he added.'This is an opportunity for local companies to own a trophy company,' the Philamlife chief said.Also to date, Philamlife has interests in insurance, banking and asset management.It has total assets of P170 billion and consolidated net worth of P49.5 billion as of last year and employs about 1,500 people.The bulk of the company's invested assets is concentrated on marketable Philippine government securities, corporate bonds and blue-chip equities.Philamlife subsidiaries and affiliates are Philam Insurance Co. Inc., a merger of American Home Assurance Co. and Philippine American General Insurance Co.; Philam Care Health Systems Inc.; Philam Plans Inc.; Philam Asset Management Inc., which administers three mutual funds, Philam Bond Fund, Philam Fund and Philam Strategic Growth Fund; Philam Financial Advisory Services Inc.; and Philam Properties Corp.To see more of The Manila Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.manilatimes.net.
