Australian subsidiaries of embattled US insurance giant American International Group Inc (AIG) have reaffirmed their commitment to local clients and partners.AIG chairman and chief executive Edward Liddy announced in the US overnight plans to sell off the company's 'non-core' assets to pay off its unprecedented loan from the US Federal Reserve.The company has drawn $US61 billion ($A79.14 billion) from the Fed's loan of up to $US85 billion ($A110.28 billion) launched last month to stave off collapse at AIG.In exchange for the loan, the US government took a 79.9 per cent stake in the insurance behemoth.Mr Liddy said AIG planned to retain 'a continuing ownership interest in its foreign life insurance operations'. AIG General (Australia) chief executive Chris Townsend said the US announcement confirms the local arm as an important part of the global business. 'We're of course very pleased with this decision and it confirms that AIG Australia, as part of the foreign general insurance operations of AIG, is a core business,' Mr Townsend said in a statement. 'We are a strong, well-capitalised company protecting hundreds of thousands of individual customers and businesses in Australia and we're here to stay. 'I want to assure our customers and broker partners that these recent decisions have strengthened even further our desire and promise to underwrite complex risks.' Life insurer AIG Life also welcomed Mr Liddy's statements, with regional president Mark Wilson declaring it good news for its 20 million policyholders in the Asia-Pacific region.The intention announced by the company's US parent 'heralds a new era for the business', Mr Wilson said. AIG Life (Australia), a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG incorporated in Australia, employs 370 people across five state capitals.AIG General (Australia) employs around 500 people locally.
