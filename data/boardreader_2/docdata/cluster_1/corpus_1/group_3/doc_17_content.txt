American International Group Inc intends to sell three life insurance companies operating in Japan, AIG's Japanese unit announced late Friday (October 3).The sale of the three life insurance companies--Alico Japan, AIG Edison Life Insurance Co and AIG Star Life Insurance Co--is a de facto withdrawal by AIG from the life insurance business in Japan. The embattled US insurance giant does not plan to sell two nonlife insurance companies--AIU Insurance Co and American Home Assurance Co in Japan--indicating the company will concentrate its business on home and other types of insurance.Insurance contracts provided by the three companies are expected to be valid after the sale.Earlier Friday, AIG announced in New York that it planned to retain its US property and casualty and foreign general insurance businesses as well as its ownership interest in its foreign life insurance operations. Shortly after the announcement, however, AIG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy said Alico Japan would be on the company's sell-off list.Following the chairman's remark, which was made at a conference for analysts arranged by AIG, the Japanese unit announced that the parent likely would sell the other two life insurance companies operating in Japan as well.AIG, which considered the Japanese life insurance market its largest after the United States, apparently judged that it must accelerate its corporate rehabilitation by using proceeds from the sale of the three Japanese insurance companies to pay off a massive government loan.AIG's Japanese arm said the planned sale would not affect insurance contracts of the three companies nor related services.Alico Japan, which began operations as the first foreign life insurance company in 1973, has been growing through mail and telephone marketing and sales of life insurance and other products.AIG Star Life Insurance took over Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance Co, which collapsed in 2000. AIG Edison Life Insurance took over Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co, which went bankrupt in 1999. AIG Star Life Insurance and AIG Edison Life Insurance are AIG whole subsidiaries.AIG's five Japan-based companies have a combined total of about 26,000 employees, the largest among foreign insurance companies.AIG apparently believes that retaining its two nonlife insurance companies in Japan will give it an advantage in the nonlife insurance market. According to the company, the nonlife insurance business currently generates as much as US$40 billion in profit worldwide.
