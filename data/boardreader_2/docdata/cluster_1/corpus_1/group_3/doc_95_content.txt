AIA Hong Kong and other individual country insurance businesses of AIA are not for sale, AIA president Mark Wilson said.American insurance giant AIG plans to sell a minority stake in the overall AIA umbrella company, which owns life insurance businesses across Asia, but this will not affect the ownership of individual country entities, Wilson said in Hong Kong yesterday.'The change of [minority interests] doesn't impact the customers,' Wilson added. 'It doesn't have any impact on the day-to-day business.'In Hong Kong, AIA has received more than 8,000 new policy applications in the past two weeks, said Derek Yung, senior vice president and general manager of AIA Hong Kong and Macau.'In Hong Kong, it's business as usual,' Yung said. 'Over the past two weeks, the business is stable.'More than 300 new agents were added as part of a recruitment drive last month, Yung said.Wilson said New York-based AIG has made it clear it intends to retain a majority stake in AIA, as AIG considers its Asian arm one of the crown jewels.More than 99.9 percent of AIA's policyholders in the region are still with the firm despite the uncertainty of the past two weeks, Wilson said.AIA has about 20 million policyholders, so the figures provided by Wilson indicate that fewer than 20,000 have jumped ship.'There is a little bit of impact on our new business, but we are able to handle it,' Yung said. 'This financial turmoil is not only affecting AIA, I think it affects all businesses in Hong Kong - maybe all businesses in the world.'Wilson said the company has received approaches from 'dozens of entities around the world' about buying a minority stake in AIA, but has not entered discussions with anyone yet. He declined to comment on whether China Life (2628) is one of the suitors.A minority stake in AIA could be sold to one investor, or to a group of investors, said Wilson, adding the firm will appoint investment bank advisers in the next week or two.'We're not ruling anything out at this stage. We'll look at all types of investors,' Wilson said.AIA remains financially strong, said AIA Asia Pacific chief investment officer John Chu. AIG's plan to sell a minority stake in AIA only represents AIG's desire to raise capital to pay back the emergency loan from the US Federal Reserve, Chu said.AIA has businesses in greater China, South Korea, India, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. AIG may completely sell off three life-insurance units in Japan, but they are not part of AIA.AIG Tower, on Connaught Road in Central, is not for sale, according to AIA Asia Pacific chief investment officer John Chu. Despite its name, the building is owned by AIA, not AIG.
