Establishing clear regulations for the entire financial services industry will not be without opposition, if the battle over indexed annuities is any indication.How much regulation and who gets regulatory powers are hotly contested issues as lawmakers try to establish a rescue plan for the industry. AIG's bailout earlier this month raised the question of how complicated financial firms should be regulated.Like many financial services companies, AIG's insurance entities are regulated at the state level, while the holding company is accountable to federal regulators. Companies argue that new federal regulation would bring additional costs in registering and selling products, which could be pass to customers. 'The key distinction here is that AIG's insurance subsidiaries did not cause this crisis - rather, they will play a critical role in the solution,' said Sandy Praeger, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. 'Calls for federal regulation of insurance in light of these events are simply unable to be supported.'But the call for federal regulation of equity-indexed annuities came before AIG's meltdown, and it's giving regulators a preview of the opposition they might face in taking over insurance regulation.In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule making it the regulatory body in charge of equity-indexed annuities. More than 2,300 comment letters have been filed with the SEC, the majority opposing the proposed rule.'The larger issue here is: Who do you want ultimately regulating insurance and insurance products?' said Iowa Insurance Commissioner Susan Voss. 'My take for the industry is that this is a terrible way to get to federal regulation.' Equity-indexed annuities are popular investment products, sold by insurers, with a guaranteed income. Unlike other fixed annuities, indexed annuities allow holders to receive gains when markets do well.Equity-indexed annuities are often sold to seniors, 'for whom they may be unsuitable investments due to substantial early surrender charges that lock up older investors' money for many years,' the SEC said in June in a statement announcing the proposed rule. The rule would establish standards for determining when equity-indexed annuities may be considered securities subject to the investor protections afforded by the securities laws.The market for indexed annuity sales totaled $6.93 billion in the second quarter, compared with sales of $5.78 billion for the previous quarter, according to AnnuitySpecs.com.Second-quarter sales were up 6 percent when compared with a year ago, the industry Web site said.Iowa insurers account for about one-third of equity-indexed annuities sold.Major insurers have annuity operations in Iowa, including American Equity Investment Life Holding Co., ING USA Annuity and Life Insurance Co., Principal Life Insurance Co., Transamerica Life Insurance Co., EquiTrust Life Insurance Co., Midland National Life Insurance Co., and Aviva USA Life and Annuity Co.Most of these companies filed comments opposing the SEC's proposed rule. 'We don't think they are securities products. They are insurance products,' said Chris Littlefield, chief operating officer at Aviva USA, the nation's largest seller of equity-indexed annuities.Littlefield said the SEC's proposed rule was 'a little bit of a surprise,' given that the regulatory group looked at equity annuities when they were introduced and decided not to regulate them at that time.Voss said her division has made strides over the past several years to address some of the concerns the SEC raised in its proposed rule by working with the annuity providers. 'That's the difference between (us and) the SEC and the feds, is that we have control over the companies, so we can go to the company and actually force things down to the producer and the buyer,' Voss said.Equity-indexed annuities, as a form of fixed annuities, are regulated by the state insurance commissioners. Variable annuities, also offered through insurance companies, are regulated by the SEC. Groups like the North American Securities Administrators Association say both should be regulated at the federal level. 'State insurance laws alone cannot protect the public from the abuses associated with equity-indexed annuities,' said Karen Tyler, president of the North American Securities Administrators, in the group's comment letter to the SEC. 'The safeguards they provide are no substitute for the investor protections contained in the federal securities laws.'Also opposing the rule are variable-indexed annuity providers, such as the Hartford and AXA Group. 'A lot of those complaints were based on broker dealers losing business to the equity annuities, because the guarantees took away the risks of the markets,' said Jim Mumford, first deputy insurance commissioner at the Iowa Insurance Division.Variable annuities keep the account assets in a separate account. As the value of the account goes up or down, the risk is on the individual investor, he said. That is what makes them securities.Indexed annuities, on the other hand, are part of the general account of the insurance company. As the market goes up and down, the company takes the risk.The proposed SEC rule would require equity-indexed annuities to be registered as securities and sold only by licensed brokers.'The primary cost is around the registration of the product with the SEC,' Littlefield said. 'It's not an inexpensive or speedy process.' He said products would have to satisfy the security requirements, as well as the insurance requirements in all 50 states.Those costs could be passed on to consumers, Mumford said.'Companies are going to see a lot more expense,' he said. 'And all that is going to be costly to the current policyholders because the costs get passed on.' Mumford and Voss said companies that already employ or work with broker/dealers with their other products would have the easiest times shifting to federal regulations.But many insurers, while opposing the proposed federal regulation, would continue to sell the products to consumers. 'There is strong consumer demand for this type of guarantee,' Littlefield said.He expects changes will be made to the rule before it goes into effect. The SEC 'is a very professional regulator, and will listen to the comments,' he said.
