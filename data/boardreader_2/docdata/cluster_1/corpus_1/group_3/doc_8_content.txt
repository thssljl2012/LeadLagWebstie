The contrast could not have been more stark. As Martin Sullivan, the former chief executive of AIG, testified before Congress that a single accounting rule had caused his firms near collapse, Henry Waxman, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives chief investigative committee, flashed images of a luxury hotel on to TV screens. In a moment of drama usually reserved for US court rooms, Waxman showed pictures of the luxury St Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California. AIG executives had  according to the congressmen  convened there for a week-long retreat just one week after the US Treasury saved it from certain failure with an $85bn bail-out. Bills showed the fallen insurer  and, some argued, US taxpayers  had paid nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges. AIG insiders on Tuesday admitted after the hearing that the company paid for the retreat but said it was designed as a reward for a group of high-performing, self-employed life insurance agents  not AIG executives. Even if the distinction had been made, it would not have been likely to make a difference.
