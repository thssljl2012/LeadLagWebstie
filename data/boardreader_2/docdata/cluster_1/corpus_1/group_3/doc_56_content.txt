Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRESTroubled insurer American International Group (AIG) is not cutting its insurance prices in order to hang on to skittish customers, a company spokesman said Wednesday.'We are not sacrificing rate to retain market share,' said AIG spokesman Peter Tulupman in an email. 'In fact, since mid-September, our U.S. commercial insurance operations have had several points of rate improvement compared to [year-to-date] results.'His remarks come after rival property insurers said they had seen signs of stress in the market, including some insurers that have drastically cut prices in order to keep business.Earlier Wednesday, Evan Greenberg, chairman and chief executive of Ace Ltd. (ACE), said that his company was getting requests to quote insurance rates for AIG customers.Greenberg said that one large insurer is cutting prices 'in an irresponsible way' in order to hang on to some of its accounts.He did not name the 'large player who is under stress,' but likely was referring to AIG, the largest commercial insurer, that has come under pressure to quickly sell many of its businesses to raise capital to pay off federal loans.William R. Berkley of W.R. Berkley Corp. (WRB) also spoke of companies that are under capital stress, including AIG, though he did not mention rate-cutting.'It is possible that allegations of price cutting are coming from markets frustrated by their inability to win significant market share from AIG,' said AIG's Tulupman. 'Fortunately, our market strengths and customerrelationships were built over many years and are not easily replicated.'-By Lavonne Kuykendall, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4141; lavonne.kuykendall@dowjones.comClick here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=nmC%2FAKYmgJGLUOTz%2FlV6rA%3D%3D.
