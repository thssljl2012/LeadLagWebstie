Embattled insurer American International Group Inc. said it will sell three of its Japanese life insurance businesses.As part of its effort to pay off a massive U.S. government loan, AIG has decided to unload Alico Japan, AIG Edison Life Insurance Co., and AIG Star Life Insurance Co., the company said late Friday.On the brink of failure last month, AIG was bailed out when the government offered it an $85 billion loan during the ongoing credit crisis that saw Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. file for bankruptcy protection and the sale of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. to Bank of America Corp. In return for the loan, the government received warrants to purchase up to 79.9 percent of AIG.AIG, one of the world's largest insurers, also said Friday in New York that it would sell a number of business units around the world, though it did not specifically disclose all the assets being considered for sale or their expected prices.'Our goal is to emerge from this process as a smaller but more nimble company that is solidly profitable and has good long-term growth prospects,' AIG Chairman and CEO Edward M. Liddy said in a statement.A number of overseas and domestic companies are believed to be interested in AIG's Japan units, including the Allianz Group of Germany, Aegon N.V. of the Netherlands, Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Tokio Marine Holdings Inc., Kyodo news agency reported Saturday.Alico Japan will likely be sold for around 2 trillion yen ($19 billion), while the two other units should fetch at least 500 billion yen each ($4.8 billion), Kyodo said.AIG's Japan unit has not provided further details on the upcoming sales but said it will retain its casualty insurance operations, in line with the company's overall plan to refocus on its core property and casualty insurance businesses.
