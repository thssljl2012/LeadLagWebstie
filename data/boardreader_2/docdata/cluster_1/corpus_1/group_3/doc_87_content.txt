NEW YORK American International Group, the insurance giant that drew fire for executive golden parachutes and an ill-timed junket even as it receives a massive taxpayer bailout, has agreed to mend its ways.AIG promised to recover executive payments and other compensation, cancel perks and institute reforms one day after New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo threatened legal action over its controversial spending.Asked whether his office was investigating other firms executive compensation, Cuomo said Yes but added, I cant say at this time which companies. He spoke on a telephone conference call with reporters.AIG will provide a full accounting of executive compensation and help recover payments that Cuomo contends violated state law, according to a joint statement from the attorney generals office and AIG, issued after Cuomo met with AIGs new chief executive, Edward Liddy, on Thursday.Those payments include all forms of compensation paid to former CEO Martin Sullivan and the former head of the (AIG) Financial Products Unit, Joseph Cassano, the statement said.Cuomo had objected to extravagant payments to executives who ran the company into near-collapse, including a US$5 million cash bonus and US$15 million golden parachute to Sullivan earlier this year, as well as a US$34 million bonus for Cassano, whose unit generated the bulk of AIGs losses.Moreover, AIG will not make payments to departing Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger pending the outcome of the states ongoing probe. Cuomo said Bensingers severance would have been in the US$10 million range. AIG on Thursday said it named David Herzog as its new CFO.AIG agreed to immediately cancel all junkets or perks not justified by legitimate business needs. As a result, AIG will cancel more than 160 conferences and events for total savings of more than US$8 million.AIG drew fire last month when news emerged it had picked up the tab for a US$440,000 weeklong retreat at a luxurious California resort for top-performing insurance agents.AIG, once one of the worlds most powerful financial services companies, nearly went broke last month because its business underwriting credit default swaps began hemorrhaging money.U.S. officials rescued AIG by providing US$85 billion in emergency loans  later increased to US$123 billion.The loans were intended to give AIG time to sell assets and repair its finances.Cuomo told reporters that he did not promise AIG his office would not go to court but no formal court action had been taken. He emphasised that Thursdays actions by the New York firm were cooperative.
