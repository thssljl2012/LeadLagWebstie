The US Federal Reserve has extended more credit to American International Group. AIGs line of credit has been added to by another $37 billion. The Wall Street Journal has reported AIG has already drawn down $61 billion of the $85 billion line of credit the Fed extended to the company on September 17th, which means AIGs bailout total has now reached $122.8 billion. A Fed statement said the extended credit would allow AIG to replenish liquidity used in settling transactions, while providing enhanced credit protection to the New York Fed and US taxpayers in the form of a security interest.
