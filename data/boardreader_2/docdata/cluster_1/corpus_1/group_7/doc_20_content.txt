 The inquiry relates to overseas finance deals made by AIG Financial Products Corporation.  AIG, once the world's largest insurance firm and better known in the UK as the shirt sponsor of football side Manchester United, is not suspected of misselling insurance.  The SFO is working with US authorities who are already conducting separate, independent investigations involving conduct at the firm.  City watchdog the Financial Services Authority is also involved in the investigation.  SFO director Richard Alderman said: 'It is right for us to look into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corporation to determine if there has been criminal conduct. 'We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations.' The SFO said both AIG and the subsidiary in question are cooperating with its inquiries.  AIG was on the brink of collapse when the US government offered a crucial 100bn lifeline and took a stake in the firm in mid-September.
