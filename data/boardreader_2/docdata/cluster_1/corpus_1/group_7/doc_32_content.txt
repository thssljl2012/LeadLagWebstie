LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Britain's Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday it had launched a preliminary inquiry into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp, a subsidiary of American International Group Inc. The SFO said the probe did not concern the insurance operations of AIG in Britain or elsewhere. 'It is right for us to look into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp to determine if there has been criminal conduct,' Richard Alderman, director of the SFO, said in a statement.
