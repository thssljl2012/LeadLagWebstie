The Ohio Attorney Generals Office has struck another settlement tied to a five-year-old class-action suit against insurer  and other defendants.  Attorney General Richard Cordray on Wednesday said Stamford, Conn.-based  has agreed to pay $72 million to settle claims in litigation against AIG (NYSE: AIG). The state, representing Ohios public pension funds, had alleged the firm conducted a fraudulent reinsurance transaction that allowed AIG to inflate its loss reserves.  The settlement comes a year after four former General Reinsurance executives and a former AIG executive were federally convicted of conspiracy and fraud charges tied with the reinsurance deal, Cordray said.  A message seeking comment on the settlement was left with General Reinsurances general counsel who couldnt immediately be reached. The ,  and  through the attorney generals office have been seeking damages for investors who lost money after buying AIG securities between 1999 and 2005.  Former Attorney General Jim Petro first sued AIG in 2004 after New York officials probed charges of bid-rigging among AIG and other insurance companies. That probe uncovered new charges, including the alleged transaction with General Reinsurance, and led to the ouster of Hank Greenberg, AIGs longtime CEO. The settlement comes about four months after the state settled AIG-related claims with accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for $97.5 million. That deal put to rest allegations that the firm violated securities laws by providing unqualified opinions on AIGs financial statements during the years in question.  Cordray spokesman Ted Hart said litigation against AIG and other parties, a long list of defendants that includes underwriters Wachovia Securities and Merrill Lynch, remains unresolved. Wednesdays General Reinsurance settlement requires an OK from U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  E-mail dayton@bizjournals.com. Call (937) 528-4400.
