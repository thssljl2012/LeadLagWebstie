 The UK's Serious Fraud Office said that it is investigating the UK business operations of AIG's Financial Products division. 'The SFO is cooperating with US authorities who are already conducting separate, independent investigations involving conduct at AIG Financial Products Corp and with UK- based financial services regulator, the Financial Services Authority. SFO's inquiry does not concern the insurance operations of AIG in the UK or elsewhere,' it said. The SFO's swift action is in keeping with its new approach under the current director of intervening proactively at an early stage when it is made aware of irregularities which warrant further investigation.  The Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Richard Alderman, said: 'It is right for us to look into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp., to determine if there has been criminal conduct. We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations.' AIG said that it will cooperate fully with the inquiry.  AIG began the process of unwinding certain of AIGFP's and its subsidiaries' businesses and portfolios, including those in the UK, late last year.  There are approximately 370 employees in AIGFP worldwide who are working on the winding down of the business.
