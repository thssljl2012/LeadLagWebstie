The top executive at Nationwide has resigned and been replaced by the president and chief operating officer, the company said this afternoon, marking an abrupt change in the middle of an economic downturn.  Jerry Jurgensen, chief executive since 2000, and the company's board of directors 'mutually agreed' that Jurgensen would step down, Nationwide said in a news release. He has been replaced by Steve Rasmussen, who has been with Nationwide since 1998. 'We want to thank Jerry for his contributions over the last eight years,' said National Mutual board member Keith Eckel, in a statement.  Spokesman Joe Case had no explanation for the timing of the move. 'I'm not privy to information about why now, but obviously the board felt it was an appropriate step,' he said. 'We're very respectful of the contributions Mr. Jurgensen has made over the past eight years.' Jurgensen came to the Columbus-based company from Bank One in Chicago. At the time, his hiring was notable because he was Nationwide's first leader to come from outside the company and with no background in insurance.  During his tenure, Nationwide expanded its marketing activities, including sponsorship of the PGA's Nationwide Tour.  Nationwide, along with most insurers, has struggled with investment losses, and its Nationwide Financial Services subsidiary in November reported a net loss of $346 million for the third quarter.  Jurgensen, 57, has been a prominent figure in charitable and civic activities, particularly on issues related to public schools. 'I welcome the opportunity to lead Nationwide Mutual as its CEO at this important time for the company,' said Rasmussen, 56, in a statement. 'While it's clear that our entire industry faces challenges, Nationwide's capital position is strong and we have the right strategy to grow market share.' dgearino@dispatch.com
