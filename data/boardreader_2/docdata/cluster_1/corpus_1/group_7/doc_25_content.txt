BEIJING -(Dow Jones)- Bank of China Ltd. (3988.HK) currently isn't bidding for the Asian life-assurance unit of American Insurance Group Inc. (AIG), an official at the Chinese lender told Dow Jones Newswires on Thursday.   The official, who asked not to be named, declined to comment further when asked if Bank of China is in talks with AIG on any purchase.   Wednesday, the Financial Times cited sources as saying Bank of China had emerged as Beijing's preferred choice as a potential bidder for the Asia unit of AIG, which analysts estimate is worth about US$20 billion.   The report said the Chinese lender is in active discussions with financial advisers and Chinese policy makers about the merits of joining the auction for assets owned by the U.S. insurance giant.   -Victoria Ruan contributed to this story, Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588-5848; victoria.ruan@dowjones.com   Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/access/al?rnd=TpXDT9wMtdRbvWxp6upb%2FA%3D%3D.
