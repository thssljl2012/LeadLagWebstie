American International Group Inc. is expected to hold the final round of bidding for two Japanese life insurance units this month. The battered U.S. insurance giant is auctioning off AIG Edison Life Insurance Co. and AIG Star Life Insurance Co. Gibraltar Life Insurance Co., a Japanese subsidiary of U.S. firm Prudential Financial Inc., and Canadian insurer Manulife Financial Corp. are thought to be the only bidders.   The price is seen coming to around 100 billion yen (US$1 billion).
