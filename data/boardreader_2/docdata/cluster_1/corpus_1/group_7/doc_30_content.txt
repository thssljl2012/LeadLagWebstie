The United Kingdom?s Serious Fraud Office has announced what it described as a ?preliminary inquiry? into activities of AIG Financial Products Corp., the subsidiary of American International Group Inc. that underwrote the credit default swaps commonly cited as central to the problems that led to its bailout by the U.S. government. The investigation is being carried out in cooperation with authorities in the United States and with the Financial Services Authority, the U.K. regulator. The ?inquiry does not concern the insurance operations of AIG in the U.K. or elsewhere,? the Fraud Office said. The office said its is following a new policy of moving at ?an early stage when it is made aware of irregularities which warrant further investigation.?   Richard Alderman, director of the Serious Fraud Office, pledged to conduct a vigorous investigation.   ?It is right for us to look into the U.K. operations of AIG Financial Products Corp., to determine if there has been criminal conduct,? Alderman said in a statement. ?We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company?s operations.?   AIG promised to ?cooperate fully? with the investigation. AIG said in a statement that it ?began the process of unwinding certain of AIGFP's and its subsidiaries' businesses and portfolios, including those in the U.K., late last year.?   This process, AIG said, involves about 370 AIG Financial Products employees around the world. AIG Financial Products Corp. is active in such markets as fixed-income products, equities, credit, foreign exchange, metals and energy.
