How long before we see more of these kinds of actions worldwide?  A bomb exploded outside a Citibank branch in Athens early Monday causing damage but no injury. A police statement said the bomb went off at 3 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) Monday in the Nea Ionia district of the capital. The device had been planted behind the two-story bank building, which suffered moderate damage. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, and police said they had received no warning call. Police said the bomb was detonated from very close to the blast site, with the use of electric cables. A police spokeswoman said the attackers used &#8220;a medium-sized improvised device,&#8221; and the damage to the building was not severe. She was speaking on customary condition of anonymity. The target of the attack pointed to Greek far-left militant groups, which have become increasingly aggressive following the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy in December  an incident that sparked the country&#8217;s worst riots in decades.
