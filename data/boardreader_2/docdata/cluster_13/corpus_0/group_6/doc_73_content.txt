       The Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburgh is actually opening a new branch on Montague Street in Downtown Brooklyn.That would be right near the Citibank branch where bank bosses have been demanding untold billions in federal bailout help, as they've also talked about severing parts of their aching body, like the Smith Barney investment side of the banking behemoth.The Dime goes back to 1864 when Brooklyn and the nation were struggling for survival in the Civil War. The bank, like the nation, survived. And in significant ways, the bank is doing much better than the nation, it seems.Last year as the country sank into recession and large commercial banks showed the dollar-sapping effects of bad (corrupt, really) practices, Dime says it stayed the course.Dime's President Vincent F. Palagiano has said his institution, with 23 branches around the region, steered clear of the sub-prime mortgages that destroyed the dreams of innumerable poor homeowners and, in the longer sense, the dreams of most American households.While others downsize and close, Dime grows."We've been doing well and Brooklyn's been very good to us," was quoted as saying in the Brooklyn Downtown Star.Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz is quoted as saying, ""If you look at their financials, Dime has weathered the storm very well."
