Interesting...The basis of the lawsuit is that AIG intentionally promotes Shariah-compliant businesses and insurance products, which by necessity must comply with the 1200 year old body of Islamic canon law based on the Quran, which demands the conversion, subjugation, or destruction of the infidel West, including the United States.&amp;nbsp; To help achieve these objectives and with the aid of federal tax dollars, AIG employs a three-person Shariah Advisory Board, with members from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Pakistan.&amp;nbsp; According to AIG, the role of its Shariah authority &amp;ldquo;is to review operations, supervise its development of Islamic products, and determine Shariah compliance of these products and investments...&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;According to the lawsuit, use of taxpayer funds to acquire ownership of a business that intentionally promotes, endorses, supports, and funds Shariah-based Islamic religious practices violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&amp;quot;-www.thomasmore.org/qry/page.tafI 'm curious to know if the &amp;quot;Shariah-compliant businesses and insurance products&amp;quot; are just a politically correct subdivision that is marketed to Muslims and Muslim-owned businesses -which it kind of sounds like here http://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=82726&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That sounds a little like a company offering a line of &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; investments to capture a certain part of the market. Moreover I didn't think the feds were actually &amp;quot;acquiring&amp;quot; AIG through the bailout except as a temporary expedient to prevent a further collapse of the financial industry. We don't plan to &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; AIG in the long run. Besides, while the feds are shareholders (even temporarily) wouldn't it be a perfect time for them to do away with, or manipulate those Shariah-compliant subdivisions away from the anti-American influences, or possibly use them to track down where money might be going?Bottom line is, I don't know if this really directly violates the establishment clause. If it did, shouldn't giving funds to faith-based initiatives be excluded as well.
