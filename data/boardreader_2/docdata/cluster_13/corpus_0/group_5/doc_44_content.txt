Originally published at policywank. You can comment here or there.After a six day occupation of their closed factory, the workers at UE Local 1110 managed to get a $1.75 million settlement last night. All of the money is coming from JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. The money will pay out their accrued vacation time, will give them the 8 weeks of pay they&amp;#8217;re entitled to under WARN and get them two months of additional health insurance. Hopefully, more workers in this ocuntry will take the lesson here and not just roll over when their plant, site, or office is shut down.
