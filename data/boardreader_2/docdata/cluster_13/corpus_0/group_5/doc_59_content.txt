As 2008 draws to a close, we present a look back on some of the major issues we covered in the first full year of the Community-Based Planning Task Force&amp;#8217;s blog: The Good  Defeat of the AIA&amp;#8217;s      Proposed Zoning Text Amendment: In late 2007, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) proposed      amendments to the New York        City zoning text, which the organization claimed      would encourage innovative design and sustainable building practice. However, community participation in creating      these amendments was minimal, and many expressed      concerns that this could set a precedent for other private entities,      including developers, to push through citywide zoning text changes with      little to no community process. Ultimately, the AIA withdrew      the amendments in order to seek more time for public discussion.   Defeat of TransGas in Williamsburg: We keep a close eye on Greenpoint-Williamsburg because their 197-a plans are two      of only 10 adopted by the City, and the implementation of the plans is      still spotty. One major step toward      the communitys vision for a continuous waterfront park came      in March, when neighborhood activists contentious, seven-year battle      against Trans Gas Energy ended when the State Siting Board dismissed TGEs      proposal to construct a power plant on property that is slated to become      the Bushwick       Inlet Park.    The Accountable Development Working Group: In June,      Community-Based Planning Task Force member organization Fifth Avenue Committee convened the Peoples      Accountable Development Summit in Brooklyn to create dialogue and      forge alliances among residents and various community stakeholders in      Brooklyn facing large developments, re-zonings and other land use changes. Building on momentum from this summit, they started the Accountable      Development Working Group, an inclusive and open group that works      together to learn about and address ongoing neighborhood issues, including      the Atlantic Yards development and the proposed rezonings of Sunset Park and Gowanus.   Imagine Flatbush 2030: Admittedly this one is somewhat      self-serving, as the Imagine      Flatbush 2030 project was initiated by the Municipal Art       Society Planning       Center, along with      local stakeholder organizations such as the Flatbush Development Corporation. Still, it was inspirational to see a      diverse cross-section of the Flatbush community come together to create a      vision around sustainability for their neighborhood. Check out the IF 2030 wrap-up and widget on      the MAS website, and stay tuned for the full report in 2009.   Yolanda Garcia Community      Planner Award: This $2,500 award was created to commemorate the work      of Ms. Yolanda Garcia, a community activist in the South       Bronx. Each year, MAS presents the YGCP award to a community      planner who has succeeded in bringing neighborhood need and vision into New York Citys      planning process. The      2008 winner was Jeanne DuPont, Executive Director of the Rockaway      Waterfront Alliance, a grassroots community organization that promotes      public waterfront access in Far Rockaway, a barrier island in southeast Queens. Jeanne has worked closely with the community      and local youth to develop long-term planning and redevelopment strategies      there.   One City/One Future: On      December 2, a coalition of civic leaders, neighborhood advocates,      community development organizations, labor unions, affordable housing      groups, environmentalists, immigrant advocates, and other stakeholders      launched One City/One Future: A      Blueprint for Growth that Works for All New Yorkers. The      Community-Based Planning Task Force is proud to be part of this broad and      diverse coalition that supports much-needed reforms to make city planning more      participatory and inclusive.  The Bad  Manhattan Community Board 6 versus East River Realty Co.: This      battle between community planning and a big developer clearly demonstrated      the need to reform NYCs planning process to give community-based 197-a      plans teeth.  Manhattan Community      Board 6 created both a comprehensive 197-a plan for its eastern district,      including the former ConEdison site on the East River      waterfront, and a 197-c rezoning plan for the site.  The Department of City Planning and the      City Council chose to ignore the boards 197-c plan, and to consider the      197-a plan at the same time as East River Realty Companys development plan      for the ConEd site.  (Read our testimony      to the City Council and our report      from the hearing). After much      negotiation, the City passed both plans. Although the 197-a plan was used as a bargaining tool, the fact      remains that the City held the communitys plans in the pipeline until the      developer had the chance to catch up, overlooking an opportunity to      implement expressed community needs and goals.   125th Street Rezoning: Early this year, the Department of City      Planning proposed a rezoning of Harlems 125th Street.       Many factions of the community opposed      the project, citing concerns about issues from affordable      housing/displacement and gentrification, to historic preservation, to loss      of local retail and community character. The City approved      the rezoning despite the communitys intense opposition.  This process has been captured in a      documentary, Rezoning      Harlem, which is currently screening around the city.   NYC is a Chain Store City: The Center for an Urban Future      released a study (PDF) in August quantifying what community      advocates have long been concerned about: New York City has an awful lot      of chain stores and restaurants. Dunkin Donuts boasted the most      locations: 341 total in the five boroughs. We asked: could formula      retail zoning be in NYCs future?   Problematic Community Benefits Agreements:  In January, we looked at CBAs and      asked Whats      going wrong? Both the CBA that      accompanied the new Yankee Stadium development and the Memorandum of      Understanding between Columbia       University and the      Manhattanville community lacked the binding power of traditional      CBAs. What with the delay in community benefits from the Yankee Stadium      agreement and controversy over the Columbia deal, is NYC setting a bad      example for the rest of the country?  The Compromises    Willets Point: In February, the Pratt Center for Community Development released a report in response to the Citys proposed redevelopment of Willets Point, an industrial area of Queens near Shea Stadium.  The report, Making Willets Point Work: a Plan for Neighborhood Success, was based on a community-based visioning process and called for fair treatment of existing businesses and workers, a wide range of affordable housing options, good jobs targeted for local residents, infrastructure improvements, and respect for the surrounding neighborhoods. The City Council agreed that the plan was flawed, and a negotiation process began.  Ultimately, the Council approved the plan, after guaranteeing more affordable housing and fair-wage, union jobs.  However, the use of eminent domain may still be necessary for the City to acquire some property there.   East Village/Lower East Side Rezoning: Although Manhattan Community Board 3 created the rezoning plan for the East Village/Lower East Side through an open community process, the plan quickly became controversial because of its potential negative impacts on adjacent neighborhoods.  Local organizations were split on the issue, with groups such as the Coalition to Protect Chinatown calling for a stop to the plan, while other groups such as Asian Americans for Equality supported the rezoning and called for a similar process for Chinatown as a follow-up. In November, the City passed the rezoning, with a promise for an expedient rezoning process for the Bowery and Chinatown next year.  The Ongoing  Atlantic Yards: 2008 marked the fifth year since the Atlantic Yards project was announced.  The spring and summer were busy times: local organizations held a rally opposing the project, and the Municipal Art Society imagined a partial buildout of the site as Atlantic Lots.  In response, developer Bruce Ratner manufactured a pro-Atlantic Yards rally.  By August, the footprint was a mess, the stadium opening date was pushed back again, and nine property owners were challenging the states proposed use of eminent domain in State Supreme Court. In September, the State Supreme Court rejected the ESDCs motion to throw out the case, which will now be heard in spring 2009.  Most recently, Ratner stopped all work at the site, citing the ongoing lawsuit and the financial meltdown, and local organizations called for an audit of public funding spent on the development.   Eminent Domain: A major issue in 2008, eminent domain came up regarding Atlantic Yards, Columbia Universitys expansion into Manhattanville, and in the Citys redevelopment of Willets Point.  In September, the Community-Based Planning Task Force testified for state senators who are examining eminent domain policy at the state level.   Gowanus: Residents of the Gowanus area of Brooklyn are faced with many coming changes. New development is planned for the canals shores, including the Gowanus Green/Public Place site, as well as a huge complex from developer Toll Brothers. In addition, the City is planning a major rezoning to encourage both development of new housing and some retention of manufacturing/commercial uses in the area. South  Brooklyn residents have been organizing and were recently visited by City Planning Commission Chair Amanda Burden, who encouraged residents to support the Citys plan.  Still, some speculate that the City is discouraging public input, perhaps because of the extre...
