by Scott Creighton (Bullet Points - 1. Rahm had multiple conversations telling Blago&amp;#8217;s people who &amp;#8220;Obama wanted&amp;#8221; to fill the senate seat. 2. Lisa Madigan was high up on that short list. 3. Blago did NOT try to trade the senate seat for ANYTHING according to the Obama report, just released today (4:30 pm to kill the news story).) Rod Blagojevich deserves a lot of credit. He stood his ground and waited for the evidence to come out. He could have turned tail and run or he could have accepted the deal to keep his paycheck and leave, but instead, he is playing it out all the way. And as it turns out, there is even less to their fabricated story than anyone expected. Obama&amp;#8217;s team has released their &amp;#8220;report&amp;#8221; (read SPIN) on the Blagojevich scandal, and to no-ones surprise, it claims that Rahm Emanuel is completely innocent of any wrong-doing. The big story, that will be almost certainly glossed over by the apologist left and right websites, is that indeed Lisa Madigan was on Rahm&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;short list&amp;#8221; of candidates to fill the senate seat. The same Lisa Madigan, Illinois Attorney General, who tried to pervert the rule of law by seeking to have Gov. Blagojevich declared &amp;#8220;disabled&amp;#8221; and removed from office, because false accusations had been brought against him. Emanuel then had about four telephone conversations with Blagojevichs then chief of staff, John Harris, where a list of possible candidates that Obama considered to be highly qualified was discussed. Those candidates included state Comptroller Dan Hynes, Tammy Duckworth, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, and Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr., and &amp;#8212; in later conversations &amp;#8212; Attorney General Lisa Madigan and Cheryle Jackson. ABC NEWS  Lisa Madigan&amp;#8217;s attempt to confound the rule of law in this matter is inexcusable. She was clearly looking to relieve pressure on Rahm Emanuel by helping to get Blagojevich out of office before any further embarrassing investigations turned up more communications between Rahm and Blagojevich about the senate seat. And nowthat we know she was discussed as a potential candidate for that seat herself, we can see she was clearly doing it to put herself in a better position to be the next Senator from Illinois. Aside from exposing Lisa Madigan&amp;#8217;s ulterior motive, the report also refutes some of the most compelling accusations leveled at Blagojevich himself, namely that he was trying to trade the senate seat for a place in Obama&amp;#8217;s cabinet, and that he wanted Obama&amp;#8217;s people to set him up in a 501(3)(c) of some kind. Mr. Harris did not make any effort to extract a personal benefit for the Governor in any of these conversations, the report states. There was no discussion of a cabinet position, of 501c(4), of a private sector position or of any other personal benefit to the Governor in exchange for the Senate appointment. ABC NEWS Let me point that out again: Mr. Harris did not make any effort to extract a personal benefit for the Governor in any of these conversations,  So far, after all is said and done, it looks like they just rushed to get Blagojevich out of the Governor&amp;#8217;s office, based on any drummed up charge they could bring. This should leave us all looking very closely at the recent efforts of Lisa Madigan, Patrick Fitzgerald, and Rahm Emanuel, in respect to their efforts to destroy the Gov. of Illinois. Perhaps we should also start thinking about motive. If, in fact he wasn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;trying to sell the senate seat&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; then what WAS Rahm Emanuel&amp;#8217;s reason for &amp;#8220;turning Blago in&amp;#8221;? Could it have to do with Bank of America, like I wrote a week ago?  Open Secrets - Bank of Americas PAC donated  $10,000 to Rahm Emanuel and $254,167 to Barack Obama.  BOA is also a DNC partner Maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to take a close look at Rahm&amp;#8217;s phone records and see if anyone from Bank of America contacted him recently, huh?  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
