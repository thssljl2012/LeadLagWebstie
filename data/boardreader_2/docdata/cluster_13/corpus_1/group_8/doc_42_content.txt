Appearing in a proclamation sent to a weekly newspaper 'To Pontiki,' the group assumes responsibility for the March 9 early morning explosion outside a Citibank branch in Athens' northeastern suburb of Filothei, which caused extensive damage to the branch and cars parked nearby, and for the failed Feb. 18 early morning attempt at the Citibank office building in the northern suburb of Kifissia with a stolen car packed with explosives which was neutralized by bomb-disposal experts.   The group said that the targets, whether material or human, were selected on the basis of 'social and class criteria,' focusing on 'the political and economic elite, the mechanisms of the capital and the state, the police guarding them,' and not 'the general public.' Extensive reference is also made in the proclamation to the global financial crisis, the causes that led to it, and the 'role' played by Citibank and banks in general.   Greece has witnessed a series of attacks by far-left groups as well as protests and violences following the shooting of a teenager by a policeman last December.   The Revolutionary Struggle is best known for a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Athens in 2007 and is on the EU's list of terrorist groups.
