A bomb exploded outside a branch of Citibank in Athens early this morning.  It caused significant damage, but there were no reports of injuries.  No one has so far claimed reponsibility for the bomb, and police said they had received no warning call.  Last month a large car bomb was defused outside another Citibank office in Athens.
