WALLINGFORD - Police have charged a Hamden woman with insurance fraud after detectives reported that she filed false claims with both police and with the Nationwide Insurance Company for stolen items totaling more than $15,000. Rachelle Chiaraluce, 41, of 28-132 Town Walk Drive in Hamden, was arrested on a warrant last week on charges of first-degree larceny, insurance fraud and filing a false report. Police said the charges are part of an ongoing investigation into claims she has made with several companies over the past few years.  In the court warrant, police said detectives began investigating a possible false claim in December after the Wallingford Police Department was approached by a special agent with the National Insurance Crime Bureau and a Nationwide Insurance claims investigator.  The two agents told police they had reason to believe her claim was false. Police said Tuesday that she filed the claim with Nationwide on Oct. 7, 2008, and a police report with further items on Oct. 13, 2008.  Court documents said Chiaraluce claimed to have had electronic items and jewelry to her insurance agent, including a 1K chocolate diamond ring valued at $3,000, a Sony Vaio laptop worth $1,100 and reports with the Wallingford Police Department claiming losses of four other diamond or gold rings all worth more than $2,500.  Chiaraluce was released on a $10,000 surety-bond and is due for arraignment in Meriden Superior Court on March 17.
