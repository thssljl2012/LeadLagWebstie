A BOMB exploded outside a Citibank branch in Athens early yesterday, damaging cars but causing no injuries, authorities said. Police said the bomb went off at 3am in the Nea Ionia area. The targeting of a US bank pointed to Greek far-left militant groups, which have become increasingly aggressive following the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy in December.
