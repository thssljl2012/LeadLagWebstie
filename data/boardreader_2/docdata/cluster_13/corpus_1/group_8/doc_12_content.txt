NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former tennis champion John McEnroe was duped along with investment firms, art dealers and the Bank of America in a sophisticated $88 million art investment scam revealed in New York Thursday.

Others who lost money included Renaissance Art Investors, a company focussed on investment in old master paintings, which lost $45 million, authorities said.
