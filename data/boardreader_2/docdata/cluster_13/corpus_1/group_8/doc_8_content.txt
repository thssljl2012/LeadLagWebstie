ATHENS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A Greek militant group 'Revolutionary Struggle' claimed responsibility on Wednesday for two bomb attacks against Citibank branches in Athens, local media said.   The group has sent a proclamation to the local newspaper 'Pontiki' in which it assumed responsibility for the two attacks against the U.S. banking group Citibank.   A bomb exploded outside of the Citibank branch in northern Athens in early morning on March 9, damaging the bank building and the parked car nearby but no injuries were reported.   On February 18, police in Athens defused a 'powerful' time bomb outside the Citibank's headquarters in Greece.   The Revolutionary Struggle, which appeared in 2003, is well-known by the public after launching a rocket-propelled grenade into the U.S. Embassy in Athens in 2007, which caused minor damage without injuries.   Since a 15-year-old boy was killed by police last December, Greece has seen a series of protests and bomb attacks which aroused the worst riots in the country for decades.
