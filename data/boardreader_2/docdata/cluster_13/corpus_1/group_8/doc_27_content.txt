ATHENS, March 9 (Reuters) - A home-made bomb exploded outside a Citibank branch in the Greek capital causing minor damage and no injuries, police said on Monday.   There has been an outbreak of violence since the fatal police shooting of a teenager in December, which sparked Greece's worst riots in decades and rocked the fragile conservative government.
