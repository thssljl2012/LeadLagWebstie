No injuries are reported after a bomb exploded outside a Citibank branch in Athens.  Police say the bomb went off behind the bank building early Monday morning, damaging several parked cars.  There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack.  Police destroyed a car bomb abandoned outside Citibank offices in Athens last month. Authorities said the bomb contained enough explosives to crumble a four-story building.
