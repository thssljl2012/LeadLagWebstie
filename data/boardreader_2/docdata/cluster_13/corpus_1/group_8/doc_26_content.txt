ATHENS: A bomb exploded outside a Citibank branch in Athens early Monday causing damage but no injury.   A police statement said the bomb went off at 3 a.m. local time(0100 GMT) Monday in the Nea Ionia district of the capital. The device had been planted behind the two-story bank building, which suffered moderate damage. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, and police said they had received no warning call.  Police said the bomb was detonated from very close to the blast site, with the use of electric cables. A police spokeswoman said the attackers used ''a medium-sized improvised device,'' and the damage to the building was not severe.
