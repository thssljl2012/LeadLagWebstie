Greek police say a bomb has exploded outside a Citibank branch in Athens, causing damage but no injuries.  Police say the bomb went off at 3am Monday in the Nea Ionia district of the capital. The blast, behind the two-story bank building, damaged several parked cars.  There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, and police say they received no warning call.  But the target of the attack pointed to Greek far-left militant groups, which have become increasingly aggressive following the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy in December  an incident that sparked the countrys worst riots in decades.  Last month, police destroyed a car bomb abandoned outside Citibank offices in Athens. There was no claim of responsibility.
