A bomb exploded outside a branch of Citigroup in Athens early this morning. It went off at around 3am local time outside the bank in Filothei in northern Athens.  It caused significant damage but no-one was injured according to police.  Last month police foiled a car bomb attack on a different Citibank branch in the northern suburb of Kifissia.
