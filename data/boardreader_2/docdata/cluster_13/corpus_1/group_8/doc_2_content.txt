(RTTNews) - A bomb exploded outside a Citibank branch in northern Athens suburb around 3 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) Monday, significantly damaging the parked cars nearby, but no injuries were reported, media reports say.  The bomb was placed behind the bank in the suburb of Psychiko in the Nea Ionia district of the capital. Police said the bomb was detonated from very close to the blast site using electric cables. They said no warning call was received and there was no claim of responsibility for the attack.  The explosion came just two weeks after police in Athens defused a 'powerful' makeshift time bomb February 18 outside the Greek headquarters of the U.S. banking group Citibank. That bomb contained enough explosives to demolish a four-story building.  Suspected anarchist groups routinely target banks in Greece using Molotov cocktails and gas canister bombs. Athens witnessed a series of protests and bomb attacks on police by far-left militants ever since police killed a 15-year-old boy last December.  Last month saw a spate of arson attacks in Athens and Thessaloniki against newspaper offices, senior justice officials, a university professor and a prominent opposition politician.
