The explosion happened outside a branch of Citibank at 0300 (0100 GMT) in the Nea Ionia district of the capital. Police said the bomb was detonated from close by using electric cables. There was no claim of responsibility for it. Last month a large car bomb was defused outside another Citibank office in Athens, but no-one has claimed responsibility for that either. That bomb contained enough explosives to demolish a four-storey building.
