 A bomb has exploded behind a bank in Athens, damaging two cars but causing no injuries, Greek police have said.  The explosion happened outside a branch of Citibank at 0300 (0100 GMT) in the Nea Ionia district of the capital.  Police said the bomb was detonated from close by using electric cables. There has been no claim of responsibility.  Last month, a car bomb was defused outside another Citibank branch. No arrests have yet been made, but police suspect a left-wing militant group.
