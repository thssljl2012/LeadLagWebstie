In January, 834 single family homes sold, a 36 percent decrease from January 2008. Median home prices for the month were $175,500, down 6 percent from the same period last year, and roughly equivalent to the median price in January 2007, which was $175,000.  The number of active single-family home listings on the market for the month, 8,738, is unchanged from January 2008, the report said. The dollar value of single-family properties sold in January totaled approximately $192 million.  Right now, were our own worst enemy, said ABoR Chairman Jay Gohil. Uncertainty about the national economy and a looming government stimulus package have consumers taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, we expect that our strong local economy and stable real estate prices will put us back on the upside quickly when consumer confidence rebounds.  Reader Comments  Need Assistance?
