The Carol Ann and Ralph V. Haile Jr./U.S. Bank Foundation will support Vision 2015 with a four-year, $1 million grant, the foundation announced Friday.  Vision 2015 has developed a 10-year strategic plan for Northern Kentucky that includes six economic and quality-of-life goals. The Covington-based nonprofit has a small paid staff and a contingent of volunteers to help execute the plan. The resources will allow us to continue our efforts to transform the communitys regional vision into reality, said A.J. Schaeffer, chairman of the group, in a news release.  The grant will be paid in installments over four years, according to the release.  The Haile Foundation is a private, family-run foundation that focuses on arts and culture, community redevelopment, education and human services in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky.
