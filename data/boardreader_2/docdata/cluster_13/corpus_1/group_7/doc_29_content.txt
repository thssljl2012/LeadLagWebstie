Portland Business Journal  Related News  U.S. Bancorp managers have been asked to reduce the size of their budgets by 5 percent.  The Minneapolis-based bank is making the move to prepare for economic pressures that it will face this year. The company crafts a five-percent contingency plan annually and this year decided to move forward with cuts, U.S. Bank spokesman Steve Dale said. Some cuts have already been identified, including reducing off-site travel for employees. Layoffs will be considered as a 'last resort,' he said.  The cuts are not in response to U.S. Bancorps (NYSE: USB) performance in 2008, Dale said. U.S. Bank was profitable last year, unlike many banks its size nationwide.  However, the companys loan portfolio is tied to some industries that will likely suffer in 2009.  U.S. Bank is the largest bank in Oregon with 103 branches.  kgrayson@bizjournals.com   (612) 288-2106  Reader Comments  Contact the Editor Need Assistance?
