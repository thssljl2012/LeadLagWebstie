CHARLOTTE  Its still unclear when or if Charlotte residents will see AAA baseball in their city. For years, ongoing legal challenges have kept officials from breaking ground on the 10,000-seat project in Third Ward.  Were not ready to start moving dirt and borrowing that money to begin this construction. I think we need a couple elements of the legal process to flush out, and we understand that may be midsummer, Charlotte Knights General Manager Dan Rajkowski said.  In the meantime, Rajkowski said hell meet with Wachoiva and Bank of America officials who have to sign off on financing before any work can begin.  When were ready to get this thing going full force, well get back with them. I think to speak for them and say they are committed to this project, I think thats fair to say, Rajkowski said.  The project is also being affected by Charlotte attorney Jerry Reese, who has filed five lawsuits to block the minor league stadium project.  In a statement, Reese said, Once the economic situation turns around, it will make Charlotte attractive for other major league teams to relocate here. Its important Charlotte doesnt move backwards with a minor league baseball stadium.  But that sentiment wasnt shared by Hall of Famer and former Charlotte minor league player Cal Ripken, Jr.  Charlotte is a big city, but its also a nice small town city, so a new ballpark, maybe like the one in Memphis, certainly fit into Memphis really nice, Ripken said.
