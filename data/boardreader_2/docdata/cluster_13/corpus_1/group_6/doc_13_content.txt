Removed scarf from face upon request  Created On: Thursday, 29 Jan 2009, 7:48 AM CST  Nancy Krause  PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) - A man suspected of two different bank robberies within minutes of each other Wednesday may have actually helped police build a case against himself.  The first robbery happened at the Kennedy Plaza Bank of America in Providence around 11:40 a.m.  When the suspect entered the bank, his face was covered with a scarf. However, according to Providence Police Maj. Thomas Oates, the bank's security guard asked the suspect to remove the scarf before stepping up to the teller. The suspect obliged, revealing his face to the bank's security cameras.  However, that did not deter him from handing the teller a note demanding money, Oates said. When the teller refused to give the man money, he left the bank.  About an hour later, police said the same man robbed a Citizens Bank in Hoyle Square in Cranston at 12:35 p.m.  About 10 minutes later, police arrested the suspect in Providence on Westminster St. near Bridgham St., about a quarter-mile from where the Citizens robbery took place.  Oates said investigators believe the same man is responsible for both robberies, however they are not yet releasing the suspect's name.
