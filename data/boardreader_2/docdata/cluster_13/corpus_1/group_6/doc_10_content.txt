Police are seeking the public's help in locating an identified 40-year-old suspect, considered armed and dangerous, in two attempted bank robberies that occurred within minutes of each other Thursday in Springfield and Holyoke.   The suspect, identified as Darren M. Crosby, is also being sought by Ludlow police for a bank robbery in their town, Sgt. John M. Delaney, aide to Police Commissioner William J. Fitchet, said.   Crosby is believed to be living in Western Massachusetts but there is no known address, Delaney said.   The attempted robbery in Holyoke took place around noon at People's Bank 596 South St., Holyoke police said. The other attempted robbery took place at approximately 12:10 p.m. at Bank of America at 3065 Main St. in Springfield, according to Springfield police.   Delaney said Springfield police think the suspect became spooked by something outside the bank, possibly a passing police car.   He walked into the bank and presented a teller with a note demanding the teller hand cash in $5, $10, and $20 bills. The note said he had a gun but no weapon was shown, Delaney said.   Crosby is described as having dark skin and having a mustache and goatee. He was wearing a blue jacket with a blue and gray hood, and a distinctive lime green hat, police said.   Anyone with information Crosby is asked to call the Springfield Police Criminal Investigation Bureau at (413) 787-6355.   Police consider him to be dangerous. Anyone seeing him on the street should not approach him, and call 911, Delaney said.
