A suspected serial bank robber is now in jail after he was arrested Monday while trying to buy a used car in Warren.  Police plan to charge the 51-year-old Detroit man with robbing banks in Southfield and Birmingham, along with a CVS Store in Royal Oak.  The three robberies occurred over a 10-day period. In each of the incidents, the suspect threatened to blow off a grenade unless his demands for money were met.  Birmingham Police Cmdr. Mark Clemence said a multi-jurisdictional surveillance unit began tracking the suspect over the weekend. He was arrested around 11:30 a.m. Monday at the Charity Motors dealership off Schoenherr and Eight Mile Road. Clemence said it appears the suspect was trying to buy a vehicle so he could flee the area. Police said they recovered an unspecified amount of money.  Once arrested, the man was transported to Southfield and charged with the three robberies. Clemence said a cooperative effort between the FBI and police agencies in Birmingham, Troy and Southfield led to the man's arrest."Everyone worked together on this and it paid off with an arrest," he said Tuesday. "A dangerous person is off the streets and that's what really matters."jg
