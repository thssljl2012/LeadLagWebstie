A South Florida IHOP Manager has been arrested for False Accusation of Armed Robbery and charged with Filing a False Report and Grand Theft.  According to North Miami Beach Police, the manager of IHOP at 1101 North Miami Beach Boulevard left the restaurant on Sunday, December 21st with $3300 in a bank bag.  He was on his way to make a night depository drop at Bank of America.  Police say that as he approached the bank, he decided to fake a robbery and pocket the cash.  Police say the I-HOP manager then flagged down a passing police car at the bank, gave a description of the 'armed robbers' and their vehicle. The vehicle was located with the subjects inside of it and the manager positively identified one of the 2 men as the one that had just robbed him at gunpoint.  The man was arrested and the manager worked with a North Miami Beach Detective to ensure proper prosecution.  However, the Detective began to notice inconsistencies with the manager's version of what took place during the alleged robbery. The manager's story continued to unwind and police say that he admitted he had fabricated the entire story. Police say he also admitted to falsely accusing an innocent teen of committing the armed robbery, and the teen was immediately released.  The manager, Phillip A. Collins of Miami Gardens was taken into custody and transported to the Dade County Jail with the above noted charges.
