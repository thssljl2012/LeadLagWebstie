  One person may have committed a string of robberies Thursday night in Trumbull, Shelton and Stratford. 'We feel the same person is responsible for a series of incidents tonight,' Trumbull Deputy Police Chief Glenn Byrnes said late Thursday.  He said the description of the person and the vehicle seen fleeing the robberies matched. Stratford police said they had detained a person in their robbery and were investigating.  The spree began with an elderly customer being held up at an automated teller machine at the Bank of America branch in Trumbull Center at 8:10 p.m., Byrnes said. The bandit implied a weapon, he said. He was described as a white male in his 20s wearing a hooded sweatshirt and jeans, who fled in a Dodge Intrepid, police said.  Another robbery occurred at an ATM in Shelton, and a robbery at the Trumbull Marriott on Hawley Lane followed at 10:07 p.m., where a bandit demanded money from the front desk without implying a weapon, Trumbull police said.  Finally, the Homewood Suites by Hilton, 6905 Main St., Stratford, was robbed about 10:45 p.m. and a person was held, Stratford police said. Details of that incident were not immediately available.  Witnesses from the Trumbull robberies then identified the person held by Stratford as the same bandit, said Trumbull Deputy Police Chief Michael Harry.  The investigation continues, he said.
