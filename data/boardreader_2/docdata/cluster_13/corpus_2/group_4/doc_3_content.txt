 Hi,      Thanks for the reply. I have a couple of questions for you, I hope it&amp;#039;s ok.      First, you set the toolbar in the AppUi class as I understand it. Do you set it in the RESOURCE EIK_APP_INFO?      Second, if the above is true, how do you get different toolbars in different views?

My workaround for that is to have an empty toolbar in resource, make it visible and call SetDimmed(ETrue) on it if in landscape.      - in portrait, if you&amp;#039;re not using the toolbar, you have to set it invisible otherwise it will always show and occupy some space.      This was useful for me as I could not support toolbars yet in my app so I hope it will help others people porting to S60v5.      Olivier
