I have been advised that your US car insurance (none of it) is not valid in Mexico.  You must have Mexican 3rd party liability insurance or you will be escorted to a very undesirable location and possibly held until the liability issue is fully resolved.  Some credit cards cover physical damage to the rental car but none cover your 3rd party liability, towing, medical, legal, etc.       I drive down 2 or 3 times a year and get a policy covering damage to my car, medical, towing, legal, 3rd party liability, etc.  You can buy these from places such as AAA, and locations just before you cross the border (usually several) or on line which I do.  I use a company in California (Farmers Insurance) and have an AIG policy called Mexipass all done over the internet. I am sure there are many more agencies you can get a policy for you trip duration on line as well. But do consider all the coverages mentioned above to avoid serious legal problems.  If you want to contact the insurance company I use this is the email         staff.emoreno@farmersagency.com       I almost always drive at night which is contrary to the opinions of most and have been drivng from Laredo to Mazatlan or Celaya for over 10 years. However, I am usually on the toll roads which are much less prone to have cows, etc on the road at night since they are fenced liked our interstate highways.  In Indiana we have more deer accidents than Mexico has with cows-those deer are fast and come out of nowhere and really mess up your vehicle.      If you are stopped for speeding, etc you can often ask to pay the fine on the spot to avoid having to go to court. You can ask how much and sometimes bargain a little/lot since this is still quite common in some areas.      Someone mentioned topes-these can be anything from small ones that are like going over a bump to ones which will certainly damage you care if you go over them faster that 3-4 mph.  The warnings never say big or little but I have learned to watch for those signs and assume they will be the bad ones since you don't want to be disabled and stuck for days waiting on parts.
