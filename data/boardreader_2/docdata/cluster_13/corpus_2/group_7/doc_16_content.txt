I also understand that height reporting was according to the spires that they were going to add to the design, which will not be apart of the final design so I don't know how tall it will be. There is another building, 210 Trade that is also proposed that will be pretty tall. Long live the Queen City! Recession, what recession.                      210 Trade is on hold, and I don't see it getting going any time soon.  I've always thought that developer was in over his head, even before the recession hit.       But if you take a ride through uptown you'll see some fairly large "under the radar" projects that are well under way.  And I don't mean simply land cleared; I mean cranes and steel in the air, and very much under construction; such as...      440 South Church (office bldg):   440 South Church, an office development in Charlotte    Bank of America (office bldg and hotel):    1 Bank of America Center. Building. Green. Opportunities. Coming Soon...       And a project currently under construction that I am most excited about is Center City Green; its going to be a parking garage like 7th St. Station, but instead of resturants, the retail on the bottom level will be a "green market", kind of like a smaller version of the markets you find in Philly and Seattle...
