The owner of the painting used his art collection, including this piece, as collateral for a loan. He then sold the painting and pocketed the money, with the loan still outstanding.   You shouldn't do that.  If I take out a title loan or my car, or a mortgage (first or second) on my home, I can't sell the collateral with the loan still outstanding. If I could and did, I would be defrauding both the buyer of the asset (in this case, the Netherlands), and whoever I borrowed from. And I would very likely end up in jail.  JPMC is not the villain here, nor is the Dutch government. At best this is a paperwork error, but more likely the borrower tried to swing a deal that flopped, leading to its discovery and possibly criminal (not just civil) prosection.
