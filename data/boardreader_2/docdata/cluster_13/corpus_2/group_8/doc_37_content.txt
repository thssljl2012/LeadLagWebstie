Seriously, I think we may see who bids-to-relieve to HKG captain this time. The award is denied only if it creates an excess at an FDA. Technically, there's a vacancy until 9-01 closes. The CBA doesn't specify numbers. The only thing that matters is that the FDA is not full in either seat. We'll see on Thursday.
