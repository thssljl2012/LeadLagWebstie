Seems you would be entitled to a move package under Section 6 in that scenario.                      Maybe. It depends on how Mgt decides to fill secondaries.      From the CBA:   "24.B.1.b. Postings shall contain the following information:                   i. Number of crew positions to be awarded.                  ii. Type of crew position:                     (a) Primary permanent vacancy;                     (b) Temporary vacancy;                     (c) FDA vacancy;                     (d) Position(s) in excess.       24.C.6.c. If an excessed pilot is awarded or assigned a crew position that is also in excess, the number of pilots to be excessed from that crew position  may  be increased accordingly;"      My point was that with only 1 excess MD11 Capt/FO, there is not much chance of any move unless they (the Co.) decide to excess secondaries. Not a given, but it is possible.
