Great article from the Jakarta Bintangs.      Good to see the ex-pats getting excited about local development.        Will be great to see the day when Australians and Indonesians line-up together against sides from other Asian sides like China, Japan and Vietnam where Aussie and Asian players pull on the jumper side-by-side.           Quote:                         Local Footy To Receive Major Boost in 2008        A square oval, bamboo shoots at either end for goals, an astro-turf cricket pitch pervading the centre square, street vendors wheeling carts selling everything from ice-cream to fried rice lining the boundary, stifling heat, pollution, 90 per cent humidity and more bemused looks than a RSPCA member at a cockfight&#8230; Welcome to Jakarta and Australian Rules football, Indonesian style.      For more than a decade, ex-patriates from all over the world, primarily Australia, have made the trek to Cibubur Scout reserve on the outskirts of Jakarta to have a kick of the Sherrin. The Jakarta Bintangs (Stars) were established in 1995 to give Australians living in Jakarta and around Indonesia a chance to come together and enjoy a taste of home but also to have a support network in a place that can sometimes be unforgiving and very lonely.       Occasionally an opposing ex-pat team from somewhere in Asia will come to the tree lined, patchy grassed reserve for an &#8216;International&#8217; game. Though usually it&#8217;s the high flying professionals, escaping from the hustle and bustle of the Big Durian, to take a screamer and de-stress after the busy work week.      For the most part the Indonesian people have lined the banks, laughing at the &#8216;bule&#8217; (White people) and their antics, chasing the occasional cow from the field and marvelling at the ferocity of the body contact, not seen around these parts since a military advance on a peaceful student protest.       The odd bomb goes off from the nearby Sinetron (Indonesian soap opera) set, further fuelling the sense of unbridled aggression that fills the air.      So why is it now that the Indonesian people have begun to embrace the national game of their closest non-Asian neighbour?       At present there are six senior and six junior teams established in the Depok and Bogor areas of greater Jakarta. These teams, the Pancawati Tigers, Depok Garudas, Cipare Stags, Pancawati Phanters, Pondok Cina Lions and Maduhur Hawks play on an irregular basis in an annual league. With the right funding and involvement, a more structured competition could be developed.      Director of Football Operations at the Jakarta Bintangs Matthew Stephens explains the progression of football in Jakarta to this point, how it&#8217;s occurred and what is needed for the future.      &#8220;The primary approach thus far has been through schools. With the efforts of two former club members - Andi Muhammadyah and Robert Baldwin - a small junior league was established in two suburbs in the greater Jakarta area. Taking this to the next level requires a more strategic development plan.  Essentially we need to develop a cadre of Indonesians in schools and universities who can become certified as AFL coaches and then take the game out to schools themselves.&#8221;        &#8220;Once a critical mass of kids has been established and a functioning league put in place, it's then a matter of providing the coaching and facilities necessary to improve skills.  So, to summarise I guess we need coaching, participation and competition,&#8221; he says.      The development of football in a foreign land hasn&#8217;t been for economic gain, more so for the ex-pats, who have a high standard of living, to give something back to the country that affords them a profitable way of life. With majority of the 240 million Indonesian people living below the poverty line, providing them with a safe, healthy outlet through sport may in some ways contribute to their future development.      &#8220;Our main aim from the outset has been to try to provide disadvantaged kids with a healthy outlet through sport. Many Indonesian kids don't have access to sporting facilities and to healthy activity that encourages teamwork, discipline and sportsmanship,&#8221; a forward thinking Stephens says.        &#8220;We think a team sport like Aussie Rules fits the bill in that regard. So, the main function of promoting Aussie Rules here is a social one,&#8221; Stephens says. &#8220;These competitions are run by volunteers, so there is a limit to how far we can take development at this point. The Bintangs funded a full time Development Officer in 2006 using our own money. We are hopeful of securing government support to hire a full-time development officer in 2008.&#8221;      &#8220;The Bintangs have been fortunate to have excellent corporate support from local and Australian companies.  ANZ Bank is the main sponsor and prior to that the local cable TV operator Kabelvision provided significant funding to establish local footy.  This covers ground hire, transport, footies, etc.&#8221;        &#8220;One challenge working with kids without much money is that they can't afford to pay fees and buy their own equipment as we do in Australia.  So, we have to find the money to pay for everything,&#8221; says Stephens.       &#8220;The club has just secured a $16 thousand grant from the Australia-Indonesia Institute (AII) to support local development.  We have a proposal in for an Australian Youth Ambassador for Development (AYAD) as well.  If we could link the AII support to a full-time qualified Australian coach, then we could really make some serious inroads into establishing a solid platform for footy development up here,&#8221; says an optimistic Stephens.      As with any social development project a sense of attainment and satisfaction is gained when a goal is realised and Stephens thinks there is a grail to be strived for by the Indonesian football community.      &#8220;We also ultimately hope to build up footy in Indonesia to the point where a         local team can participate in the annual Jim Stynes Cup (A world cup of football for teams from around the world where football is merely developing, named after former Irish  Melbourne player and Brownlow Medallist Jim Stynes) in Australia. That would be fantastic.&#8221;      Football being the passion fuelled sport that attracts frenzied followers in their thousands to games and has a television audience in its millions will always polarise people when it comes to support and Stephens can see a problem developing in Indonesia.      &#8220;Some Indonesians are already supporting Collingwood. This has to be stopped,&#8221; joked one-eyed North Melbourne supporter Stephens.      Aside from the obvious social impacts and potential future opportunities that may come to fruition as a result of game development in Indonesia, The Australian government and Australian Embassy in Jakarta have their views on football&#8217;s contribution to the Indonesian people and its future relevance.      The Jakarta Bintangs and in turn game development may not have existed without the support of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. The largest of All Australia&#8217;s embassies,  Public Affairs counsellor John Williams explains the importance of sport and Australian Rules football to both Indonesia and Australia and feels that the game can aid in the maintenance of oft strained bi-lateral relations.      &#8220;You only have to look at the number of exchanges taking place between our two business communities, in education (there are currently 15,000 Indonesian students in Australia), in arts and culture, science, our development cooperation programs (Indonesia is now the largest recipient of Australian development assistance), and also in sport.&#8221;       &#8220;Sport has an added advantage in that it is about recreation and enjoyment (it&#8217;s uncontroversial), and entertainment - meaning a larger potential audience than most other activities.  Indonesians, like Australians, love their sport.  It's a field where we can both compete and work together.  The Indonesian Government, for example, is currently using two Australian conditioning coaches, one a former Seoul Olympian (Robert Ballard), to prepare its athletes for December's ASEAN Games in Bangkok,&#8221; Williams says.      However, the role of Australian Rules football due to it being our national game and foreign to the people of Indonesia has its own responsibility to galvanise ties with our South-East Asian counterparts.      &#8220;Australian football has a unique role to play in all this.  The Bintangs' work over several years to develop and promote the code in Indonesia has not only provided a sporting outlet for Indonesian youth from poor urban and rural communities, it has also raised the profile of, and affection for, our unique code of football, and strengthened further the people-to-people links that lie at the core of bilateral ties,&#8221; says Williams.      &#8220; The Australia-Indonesia Institute (AII) has now recognised this contribution to bilateral relations by providing a small grant to support the Bintangs' development work in Indonesia over the next 12 months. This should provide the club with a significant boost in promoting the code, and Australia,&#8221; Williams says.      So with the future looking bright for Australia&#8217;s much loved code abroad is it possible that one day the AFL will be sporting more than its solo Muslim, Bachar Houli? If the AFL come to the party and decide to invest the time and money, similar to what has recently occurred in South Africa, Indonesia could become a rich recruitment zone in the future      Although, not something that will happen soon, it&#8217;s not outside the realms of possibility. Maybe we&#8217;ll see Mark Harvey and John Worsfold scouring not only the Arena Joondalup and Claremont Oval for their next big star but heading across the globe to Gelora Bung Karno in c...
