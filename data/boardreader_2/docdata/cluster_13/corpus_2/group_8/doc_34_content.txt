     Quote:                          Rangers owner Hicks seeking investors   SURPRISE, Ariz. -- Rangers owner Tom Hicks is attempting to sell a minority share of up to 49 percent of the ballclub he purchased in 1998, he said on Tuesday at the team's Spring Training complex.    Merrill Lynch, the international investment banking firm, which became a unit of Bank of America last year, has been hired to sell minority shares of the team either in whole or part, two baseball sources said. The Rangers were born as the expansion Washington Senators in 1961 and moved to Arlington a decade later.                      MLB.com
