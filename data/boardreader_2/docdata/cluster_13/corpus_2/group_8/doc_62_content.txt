I will also get copies of my credit report by mail. I have read several threds, they say not to piss them off in the reply. They say, keep it simple and straight to the point. After looking over the first judgement, I really think it is the same debt. I don't recall having two credit cards with Citibank. Anything is possible. First I need to find out if the SOL is up.    Next I will respond. I just don't know if I need to include everything in my response. Meaning answer each question and include affrimative defenses, request debt verification with a copy of the contract agreement. I am in NC and have looked up the NC General Ststutes but they are not clear to me.      Here is the complaint:     1) the plaintiff is a foreign corporation licensed to do business in NC   2) The plaintiff is informed and beleives that the defendant is a citizen and resident of ____County, NC and is not an infant or incompetent;   3) the defendant is not in active military service, as defined in the Solder's and Sailor's Relief Act of 1940 with amendments, nor has the defendant been in such service within thirty days hereof;   4) the defendant owes Plantiff 2684.42 for charges made by Defendant to his/her credit account owned by the Plaintiff;     5) the demand for said outstanding balance has been made upon defendant, but defendant has failed to pay said amount. A copy of the Affidavit in support of Judgement is attached hereto as "Exhibit A" and is incorporated herein reference;     They pray for judgement of amount plus 8% annum form July 2008     Dated Feb 25 2009 The date was also changed by hand from January 27th. ( I think they could not serve me by mail, and sent it by sheriff, that is why they hand changed the date) I know my mailman and had him send the papers back unsigned)     Exhibit "A"    States     I am employed as a legal clerk by the plaintiff, Arrow Financial Services LLC Citibank (South Dakota), N. Adherein, and am competent to testify to the matters stated herein, which are made of my personal knowledge and are true.     That there is justly due owing by the defendant to the plaintiff herein.     That the plaintiffs assignor entered into a credit agreement with defendant(s) account number *********. The plaintiff is now owner and assignee of said account.     That said account remeains unpaid despite repeated demands by the plaintiff to the defendant for the payment of monies owed.      I do solemly declare and affrim under the penalties of perjery that the contents of this Affidavit are true     Signed by legal clerk, notirized by someone in Illinois whos commission exspires 2010     All of this looks generic to me as if they are taking a shot in the dark.    I have decided to answer like this:     1) Defendant is without information and sufficient knowledge to deny or affirm statement is true   2) Defendant acknowledges statement is true   3) Defendant acknowledges statement is true   4) Defendant denies statement is true   5) Defendant denies ststement is true     Affirmative defenses      Request Federal Fair Debt Collection Act debt verification     Request production of documents including copy of contract or agreement upon debt is based     Defendant request this lawsuit be dismissed and that judgement be entered against plaintiff for any counter- claims, cost or attorney fees.     What do you think?   Sorry so long. Just wanted to bring you up to speed. Should I look on line at my credit report for this debt? I will mail for a copy, but may not receive it in time. I must file a copy with the clerk of court and send a copy to the attoney certified by April 11th.
