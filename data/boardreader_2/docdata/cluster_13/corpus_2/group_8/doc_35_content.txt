      Quote:                          Only those 150 pilots who are actually excessed, regardless of forced or not, and then don't get to go to HKG, will be eligible for the passover pay. 20 +/- depending on the company's whims will actually go to HKG and the rest would then get passover pay in accordance to some virtual training letter.                      That is accurate per the cba and settlement which is why I think the company subsequently released the bid the way they did.  The way they've set it up, there is absolutely nothing stopping them from awarding all of the eligible pilots HKG bids on the excess, canceling 09-01, and then canceling the excess training awards in inverse seniority order up to the number of pilots they ultimately desire without paying a dime of passover.  Neither the cba or the settlement would be triggered under this scenario because no one would have been denied an award pursuant to 24.C.6.c.
