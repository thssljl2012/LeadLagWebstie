        QUOTE (cleardirect &#064; Mar 4 2009, 03:21 PM)       This judge is not a mediator or arbitrator. This judge and jury are there is determine right/wrong, responsible/not responsible. So no I do not believe that he is there to determine fairness or to split the baby. If USAPA is found to be responsible then the Nicolau is confirmed. Any changes or splitting is changing and negating binding arbitration. The stalemate will be broken when the jury gives its verdict.  USAPA was certified as the bargaining agent. With that came all of the prior commitments. Including the T/A and contracts. USAPAs C&amp;BL really have very little effect on prior contracts or this case. Do you think that just because USAPA put in their C&amp;BL that the pay rates would be &#036;250. per hour means anything? Just because USAPA put DOH in their C&amp;BL does not over ride or negate prior commitments inherited. . If the west prevails it will be the Nicolau. The latitude will come in HOW the list is implemented. If the judge sets a time line for implementation. Maybe impose fines for any delay. Maybe he removes the joint contract provision from the T/A and the list becomes active immediately. That is going to be the resolution. Not some mid point between DOH and the Nicolau.     If that is the case then sadly, April 28th will only be the end of the beginning.  Your comment "with that came all the prior commitments", seems to me the central question. I would argue that this particular "committment" was deemd so unacceptable by the rank and file that they removed the previous CBA before the committment was fully implemented. The process was interrupted. The committment was not fully consumated. IOW, there was no committment in the legal context.  It was also a process which we, east and west, had no control over. So the assumption that we entered into it voluntarily is also being scrutinized.  I hold out some little hope that the judge has the wisdom of Solomon.
