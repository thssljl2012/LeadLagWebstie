         Eeyore may have to do a Benjamin Pell in the posher parts of London, because he's on the insurance, regulation and governance incest trail again. Numero Uno Curzon Street, it turns out, may even pip the record of the previous incumbent of No 11 Downing Street for the amount of money it has lost in the decade since AIG gazumped UBS to get into the 5th floor of this prestigious address:   http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/mar/07/aig-insurance...      This necessity for a bit of totting arises because it is proving difficult to follow up Swynn's very insightful work on AIG via the web. It's always the human touch that counts, isn't it, and so it would be very nice to know who the London directors of this outfit are or were.  The FSA and SFO are doing a royal walkabout round AIG, and so Fools might like to know if any of their favourite Godfatherly chums are involved in any way at all at all- including approval of Irish Equitable style reinsurance deals.  AIG UK has offices in Fenchurch Street and Sir Thomas Moore Square, but there are no leads into the UK Board of Directors or company officers.  Can anyone help before eeyore gets out the dustcart?   Eores recyclingling, if not himself incestously.
