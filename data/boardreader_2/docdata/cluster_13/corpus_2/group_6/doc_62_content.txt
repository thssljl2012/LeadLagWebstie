The best what... You DO know that French Industry is heavily subsidized?   Oh, I just remember what the French are good at. Striking. Tell you, I was lucky earlier this year when I was traveling by Ferry to France from Dover. Luck had it I chose to travel to Dunkirk and not Calais, my usual point of entry to France. That day no ferries could unload in Calais, due to a strike by fishermen, truck drivers, ***** farmers for as far as I know. (Yes, French farmers have been known to blockade the port!).  You lot always complain about the Dems being commies. Look at ***** France.  /rant
