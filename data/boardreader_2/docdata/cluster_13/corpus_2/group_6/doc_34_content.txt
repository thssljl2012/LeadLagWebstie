Tax hike after tax hike.... fine and fine... court settlement after court settlement here we are.... no one turned to dust and Charlotte and NC are still here. There seems to be a history of adaptation.                      Yes, we are resilient here.  At least, the natives are.  There is a long (250 year) history of entrepreneurism in this region.  Businesses were indigenous, including BANKING.  All the outside interests flocked here in the last quarter of the 20th Century.  Sure, it changed the face of business in Charlotte.  But there are still plenty of us out here whose roots (and mindset) go back hundreds of years in this region - and since we are here to stay - and thus, have to make a living . . . we will figure out how to create new streams of revenue, create new businesses, employee people.      For those who came here in a wave of transfers, following exec level jobs - then maybe the situation is different.  Those folks might have roots elsewhere and unless they can come up w/ innovative ways to sustain their families here . . . they will be the people who will have to move to other locations, once again following the job openings/job offers.      Charlotte is not going to cease to exist w/o banking.  The current situation w/ layoffs makes it clear that yes, it will definitely impact life here . . . but then, so did the Depression - and the natives made it through that, too - and we are still here, today . . .
