Simply put. In an 'at will" enviroment an employer or employee may terminate employment at any time for any or no reason with or without warning! the exception is if said termination violates a law, cba or, employment contract. None of this applies here. Your efforts are best placed in filing for unemployment and seeking new work. Unfair is not always illegal!
