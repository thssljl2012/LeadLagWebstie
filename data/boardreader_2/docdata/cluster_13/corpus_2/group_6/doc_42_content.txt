All new ideas spring from old ideas, and the more ideas there are and the more people there are, the more there is room for originality. You can look at it as a math equation. If the variables are A and B, then the possibilities are A,B,AB and BA. If the variables are A,B, and C the possibilities are A,B,C,AB,AC,BC,ABC,ACB,BAC,BCA,BAC,BCA,C... CBA.   Of course in a world this large not everybody gets a chance to interact with everyone else. This is less a problem with the advances in communication technology, but still, creative people tend to gravitate to the big cities. That&amp;#039;s where there is a bigger opportunity to become even more creative.   Your question implies that there is only a finite amount of creativity. The human capacity for originality is infinite. In fact, it is almost as great, according to Albert Einstein as is the himan capacity for stupidity.
