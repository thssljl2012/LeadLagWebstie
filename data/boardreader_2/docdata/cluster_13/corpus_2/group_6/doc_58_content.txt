Thank god BIHC didn't ask for TARP funds...lol, I think any company that receives TARP funding should automatically have their entire payroll put on to a GS-SChedule of E-1, E-2...E-4, E-5..W-1, W-2, W-3...O-1, O-2, O-3...enlisted, NCO, warrant, and officer ranks with compensation in accordance with those ranks. So in that way the CEO of AIG or Citibank makes no more than the Commanding Officers of ships like the USS Wasp, basis like Cuba or Guam, or posts like the Chief of Naval Operations. I think the highest paid person in our military is about $400,000.00 a year. The CEO's of government bailed out companies should have the penalty of putting themselves and their staff on a military pay-scale. What do you think? Joshua www.unamed.us
