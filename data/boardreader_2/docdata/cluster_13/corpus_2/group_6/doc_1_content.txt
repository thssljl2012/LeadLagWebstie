Can it be any channel of maritime or do you strickly want to stay in sales. You could check out maritime insurance (broker/underwritne/agent) obviously not with AIG but Ins. companies are always hiring. Just an idea... If you are interested let me know I may be able to help you find something.                                                                                                                                                                That is an interesting angle I hadn't considered.... I spent half my career sailing on ships before spending the 2nd half ashore doing inspection, repair coordination and managing regulatory required dry-docking projects... when I retired in 06 I had to sign a no compete clause forbidding me from almost all types of employment in the marine industry..... Thanks for sharing that idea.. pre-policy condition or post accident damage survey work would be cool, got any leads?      Lol... nothin like doing a bottom inspection in Hamburg Germany from the seat of a Sportster...          Every time I asked the crew if they completed a task, I was told they were behind the 8 ball... I made sure they would stay that way until their next dry-dock..          Was always nice to see a project complete just before floodin the dock and float out...
