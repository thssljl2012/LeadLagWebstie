You can gauge the interest the Bloomberg tower has with skyscaper/development enthusiast here on this forum by seeing when the last time a post was made in that thread.     Lasting legacy...yeah right.                      Well, construction on it is over. There's no reason for there to be too many posts in that thread anymore. And the PABT tower is improving one of the ugliest structures in the city.          Quote:                         Umm...Earth to yankees12...they are working on a &amp;quot;special permit&amp;quot; otherwise known as a rezoning in order to build this. Did you not understand the reason why we're even discussing this right now in the first place?                     Of course it needs a rezoning - virtually no tower of its size doesn't need one. It doesn't need any further special permits to my knowledge, however. Its path to approval is far easier than that of, say, Tower Verre or Atlantic Yards, even though it's likely far more controversial than Tower Verre.           Quote:                         Didn't people, including londonlawyer, Derek and myself just finished saying all the other sites right in that area that can be redeveloped?     Duh, again.                     But they're not going to be redeveloped in favor of HP because Vornado doesn't own all that land, while it does own all of the land HP sits on. Vornado isn't about to redevelop a site that they would have to buy up as opposed to a site that they already own. And considering they own some of that land, another developer can't either. 34th and 7th is, sadly, going to sit there until another economic boom happens and space in the area gets so limited that they will be willing and able to buy up that land and build on it. Until then, however, they're not going to spend the resources on that when HP is sitting right there. Therefore, it's not feasible.          Quote:                         You can't have it both ways. In one argument, you say that the original Waldorf-Astoria as great architecturally it might be was replaced by the ESB. Why can't Grand Central be replaced by something architecturally better?                     Easy - because it is the pinnacle of architecture for train stations, and basically can't be replaced by something architecturally better.      There's a difference between great buildings and mediocre buildings. Great buildings shouldn't be knocked down for any reason. Mediocre ones, even if they are old, should be able to be knocked down if a far better and more beneficial building is going to replace it. It's not like HP is some great historic site either - it's an average, out-of-date building that happens to be in one of the most viable spots for redevelopment in the city.          Quote:                         You don't read well. I did not say to ignore financial benefit. I'm simply saying that if you're going to use that argument, then you have to apply it equally to every site or building as well, not just ones you find convenient to make your case.                     There are times where architectural significance overrules financial benefit, and there are times where financial benefit overrules whatever architectural value a site may have (if it doesn't have much), of course. This is one of those times where any architectural value HP might have (it isn't architecturally significant by any stretch) is overruled by financial benefit (and, in this case, a likely upgrade in what's on the site).          Quote:                         Beautiful is only your claim. We don't know what the tower will look like. That rendering is just to give you an idea. By the time, it gets buillt, it will look nothing like it. Furthermore, that tower is nothing special.                     Of course it's nothing special, it's likely little more than a placeholder. But even that placeholder is a nice looking tower that would look good in the NYC skyline.          Quote:                         Your argument is inconsistent. You even admit this tower won't be built right now but then you say the area can use the dollars right now. Get your story straight first.                     I never said this tower couldn't be built right now - I said it couldn't be built on the 34th and 7th site right now. This tower, on the HP site, can certainly be built right now.          Quote:                         You keep on insisting that we're going to get an ESB equivalent here as if that was for certain. In all likelihood, we're not.                     In this day and age, especially with the need to maximize floorspace, you're going to get at best something like a Bank of America and that is if you're lucky.[/quote]     Well, the ESB is never going to be replicated, so of course we're not getting an ESB equivalent. I never insisted such a thing, I just made a comparison between this situation and the ESB situation. In all fairness, the old Waldorf-Astoria was a lot more architecturally significant than HP, so it evens out.     And if we can get anything near a BoA, I'll be thrilled. BoA is one of the nicest towers in this city, and one the best skyscrapers built anywhere this decade.          Quote:                         You're going to have an equal chance of getting a taller version of something this also:                           Doubtful. When was the last time you saw a supertall in NYC - or anywhere for that matter - be designed like that? That's a shorter tower, and thus can have a low-key design in order to blend in and relate to its surroundings better. Taller towers naturally are going to taper off, have spires, have setbacks, curves, etc.
