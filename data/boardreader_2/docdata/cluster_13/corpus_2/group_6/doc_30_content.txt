Either the Gaza police force are unarmed as Robert Fisk asserted, or they are armed like others say. Either way one of the first things the IDF did last week was to destroy all Gaza police stations and kill as many Gaza police as they could find.    And more likely the Israeli army says "the shots came from over that way, there's some people" or "there is shooting from that building, destroy it".    The middle east is full of warlords and armed gangs, and many people are armed. In those circumstances, does the IDF expect to kill every person in Gaza carrying a gun? Israeli civilians are not being shot at. It is only Israeli invaders getting shot at by Palestinians, and almost all people actually getting shot are Palestinians either by the IDF or Settler snipers in the West bank.    In America gun ownership is considered a basic right, more important than freedom to walk down the street safely.       The sun don't shine on a sleeping dogs ass
