 more port stuff I read today. Shorter rehash of the above.             Quote:                         Colonet deadline pushed to April      NOTIMEX      The government pushed back a key deadline for companies to register for interest in Punta Colonet's $4 billion mega-port project, the second time in a month the plan has been set back.      The Communications and Transportation Secretariat, or SCT, said in the Official Gazette that the deadline to register for parties interested in the project, which was previously Monday, has been pushed back to April 24. The official signing of registered parties was moved from Feb. 4 to April 30 for domestic parties and May 15 for foreign companies. The announcement of the winning bidder remains scheduled for Aug. 31.      Other than these modifications, the terms and conditions for the project will remain the same as published originally last September, said the SCT. The project includes administering the new port, its container terminal, building and operating the rail transport route and financing the urban development near the port.      Earlier this month, the SCT said it may scrap the project entirely, as interested bidders struggle to find financing, due to the first simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and Europe since World War II, which has led to a 30 percent drop in port traffic on the Pacific coast.      The port was the single biggest portion of President Felipe Caldern's 2008 pledge to spend 570 billion pesos ($41.2 billion) in public and private money on infrastructure projects a year through 2012.       Citigroup and another U.S. bank are advising Mexico on Colonet and will present a plan by the end of the month that recommends whether the port should be built, the SCT said.                            http://www.thenews.com.mx/home/tnArt...ve_cont=260217
