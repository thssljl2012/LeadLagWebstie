The Pebble Beach tree is NOT copyrighted.       The claim is for trademark infringements for those that photograph the tree since that tree served as the model for the Pebble Beach Logo.  Trademark and copyright are completely different areas of law that share surprisingly little in common,   The same claim is made for the Citibank tower, TransAmerica tower, Chrysler buidling, etc.   The tree cannot be copyrighted because it has no legal author who can lay claim to it as intellectual property.  --    'Truth is stranger than fiction, for we have fashioned fiction to suite ourselves.'
