That was our argument...how could a bank in the U.S. be in business and be on the OFAC list?  The examiners agreed, but still insisted we do it.  What we did was do an initial scan of all banks we wire to.  Then, I look at all of the OFAC updates to ensure that no U.S. bank has been added.  If a bank has been added, then I would screen it against our wire list in addition to our entire data base.  The examiners were happy with this procedure.
