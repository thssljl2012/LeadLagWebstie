  My husband received a summons from the court a few months ago. The man from the magistrate court actually let me 15 year old son sign for it so I know that probably wasn&amp;#039;t legal. My husband went to the magistrate court and asked them what should he do (we live in a small town). He told hm that sometimes someone from these law firms would send someone to court or contract with someone in your town to show up in court (I don&amp;#039;t know if they would have done either one because the amount was $1500 - this was on a citibank credit card) We decided to just go ahead and set up a payment plan - we paid the $69.00 court fee that day - and then we have to send $50.00 a month until the bill is paid - so it will take 31 months to pay it off. And I&amp;#039;m sure his credit will be just as bad as it was before he started paying. I don&amp;#039;t know if this was the right thing to do or not - but my main worry was that my husband has many bills that are like this and now I wonder if all of the other bills will start doing the same - he has been getting letters from collection agency after collection agency for two years now - one will sell to another to another - but this is the 1st one that has actually filed a petition with the court. They can&amp;#039;t put a lein on his property or take his bank accunt or anything - because nothing is in his name at all - he was unemployed for close to two years so they couldn&amp;#039;t garnish his wages - but now that he is working they could garnish his wages. I just wish (hindsight being 20/20) that when I filed for ch 7 bk in 2005 that we would have done a joint filing (we tried to change it to joint but they wouldn&amp;#039;t let us). All of these bills are from 2005 or 2006. I wonder if we would have went to court on this charge if the payment would have been lower than $50.00 a month. ( I know court cost would have been added to it )    One thing that I did find out just last night was when I decided to google in the name of the law firm that sued him - it is on Bud Hibbs website as one of the worst of the worst collection agency&amp;#039;s - so I guess it is a law firm collection agency.
