The ban was handed down by the NFL, using their rights under a collective bargaining agreement in force nationally. Because of this, the state courts (in any state) lack jursidiction, and should have denied hearing the case. This ruling is contrary to the interstate commerce clause in the U.S. Constitution, and will likely be appealed to the Federal District court by the NFL which and overturned. I also feel that by filing this lawsuit, the players could have further action taken against them by the NFL for breach of contract, due to the provisions in the CBA that govern the prohibited substance control policy. &amp;amp;lt;quoted text&amp;amp;gt;     You are 100% correct, sir. This judge is playing fast and loose and it really is a joke.   The NFL should simply say &amp;#039;fine, you can play, but if the ban is upheld your team forfeits any game you participated in&amp;#039;I&amp;#039;m not sure why they don&amp;#039;t do that in any event. It seems ridiculous to have someone who has tested positive still allowed to play. At this point the Bears should administer &amp;#039;roids to every lineman and just keep appealing all the way to the Super Bowl and start over again next year with a new crop of bodies if this is the kinda crap they are gonna let fly.
