It was only month ago that Finance Minister Rod Gantefoer, in his mid-term financial report, described Saskatchewan's economy as "a sea of tranquility in the middle of very turbulent and stormy times."                Back in mid-November, Gantefoer had every reason to be bullish about the provincial economy, sitting on $3 billion in unbudgeted revenues and nearly $2 billion in the province's rainy day fund.                It seemed as though Saskatchewan would be spared the worst of the economic maelstrom swirling around us -- like the solitary home spared by the tornado that flattens every other house on the block.                True, there were some signs of trouble, falling oil prices foremost among them. Oil prices, which had averaged $120 US per barrel for the first six months of the fiscal year, had fallen below $60 US by the mid-point of fiscal 2008.                The finance ministry forecast oil prices to average $67 US for the last half of the fiscal year, resulting in an average price for the 2008-09 year of $94 US, but even this now seems optimistic.                Oil prices, as we've seen, continued to plummet to three-year lows of around $42 US, recovering this week to $46 US, the lowest price since January 2005.                Some analysts are forecasting oil prices to average $55 US for the next 12 months, while the finance ministry is forecasting $77 US for 2009. The fact of the matter is it's anyone's guess.                Not surprisingly, the falling price of oil is starting to have a ripple effect in the province's oilpatch. Drilling rigs, which were as rare as hen's teeth a few months ago, are being idled, even in the southeast.                Drilling is still above the five-year average, thanks to the Bakken light oil play, which has driven activity levels to record heights. But drilling budgets for 2009 are getting pared back by 40 or even 50 per cent in some cases.                Even the province's record-breaking land sales are showing signs of weakening in the coming months. While the December land was the second-best on record and two to three times higher than recent December sales, per hectare prices were down significantly from the October sale.                And for the second sale in a row, there were no acceptable bids for oilsands lands in northwest Saskatchewan and the only company with an active oilsands project in the province is putting the brakes on spending.                Oilsands Quest announced it was scaling back exploration of its Axe Lake discovery, but isn't laying off anyone -- yet.                But uranium giant Cameco Corp. is laying off about 50 employees, two thirds of them in Saskatchewan. PotashCorp of Saskatchewan announced a 20 per cent reduction in potash production for 2009, while Agrium issued "precautionary'' layoffs for 380 workers at its Vanscoy mine near Saskatoon.                Here in Regina, StarTek announced this week it would be closing down its call centre in March and laying off all 266 employees -- ironically, not for lack of work, but for lack of staff.                Of course, the magnitude of these announcements pale in comparison to the massive layoffs being announced elsewhere in the country and around the globe.                The headlines say it all. Sony to layoff 8,000 employees, Citibank plans to layoff 52,000. Even Internet search engine Yahoo is laying off thousands of employees.                While the economies of Central Canada continue to hemorrhage manufacturing jobs, Saskatchewan continues to post strong numbers in job creation and income growth, not to mention retail sales, housing starts, new vehicle sales, etc.                No one should be pushing the panic button about the state of Saskatchewan's economy.                It remains strong and will probably continue to lead the nation in 2009.                But we must recognize that we are not an island of stability in sea of economic turbulence.                The good news we should be able to keep our heads above water longer than most.                - Bruce Johnstone is the Leader-Post's financial editor.                               &amp;nbsp;The Leader-Post (Regina) 2008                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Copyright  2008 CanWest Interactive, a division of    CanWest MediaWorks Publications, Inc.   .
