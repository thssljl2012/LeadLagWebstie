 My condominium was flooded bya fire supression sprinkler head that exploded in the unit above mine 2 weeks ago while I was out of town.I was gone for 1 week and the live in building manager called a water damage control company to come into my unit and clean up the water, dry out the interior wall(the crew drilled holes into my wall and blew hot air into the wall to control for mold and water damage). After I came back homethe water damage company came back with a dry wall installer to repair the wall and paint over the new drywall. I had damage to another interior wall that I had caused myself (spilled coffee on the wallpaper) that I wanted repaired at the same time. I agreed to a price of $1000 to repair the coffee damaged wall (install new drywall over the existing wallpaper and paint over the new drywall). The drywall installer has shown up at my condominium three times andhas still not started working on either wall.The first time that he showed up he complained that my check was drawn on a Bank of America account and that Bank of America did not have a branch in Hawaii so he could not cash the check. I wrote him a new check out to cash and he couldn't cash that check because I endorsed it on the back and the bank wouldn't cash it. The drywall installer is due tomorrow morning to fix the insurance claim wall and to collect the $500 deposit on the coffee damaged wall. I don't believe that this man will come back before Christmas to fix anything. I suspect that I will pay him $500 and he will disappear for the holidays. Should I wait to pay him the $500 or go ahead and pay him the $500 tomorrow and get the project moving?
