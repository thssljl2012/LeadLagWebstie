Well, let me count the ways but for now I can only give a couple due to time.   First, if it was not for Author Blank and his millions in land donations for Coke, Charlotte would have Coca Cola.   Bank of America just announced in the Chronicle that they will be leaving Atlanta and the Bank of America building for what? Oh Charlotte.      NC is poised to exceed Georgia in total population by 2012 if not by the 2010 census. Though Charlotte metro is not the size of Atlanta metro, Charlotte City is larger now than Atlanta City by over 200,000 folks.       Thanks to our now jailed former Mayor and the overall dismal leadership of Franklin and her court, if not for the Buckhead Business leaders and other private business support such as Blank etc., Atlanta would even be worse off than it is now. We should be thankful that it is sealed in the State Constitutional Charter that Milton County cannot be re-introduced unless we change the state constitution or Atlanta would lose close to 40% of it's tax revenue from North Fulton, of which are working diligently to remove themselves.       Now, maybe if the general population of Atlanta would ever wake up and finally elect good leadership, export the current lousy council and say goodbye to Queen Shirley then Atlanta will be the jewel of the South as it should be.
