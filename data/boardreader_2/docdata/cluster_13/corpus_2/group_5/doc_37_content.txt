[1816 - Congress grants a 20-year charter to the Bank of the United States, a private central bank for America. [The Constitution had granted to Congress the &amp;quot;power to coin money and regulate the value thereof.&amp;quot; Thomas Jefferson had specifically warned the American people against turning this power to create money over to a private group that was unelected and not accountable to the public: &amp;quot;If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.&amp;quot;]       1821 - Georg W. F. Hegel formulates what is called the Hegelian dialectic - the process by which Illuminati objectives are achieved.  According to the Hegelian dialectic, thesis plus antithesis equals synthesis. In other words, first you foment a crisis. Then there is an enormous public outcry that something must be done about the problem. So you offer a solution that brings about the changes you really wanted all along, but which people would have been unwilling to accept initially.  (A good example of this would be the killings at Dunblane and Hungerford. In both cases public outrage was accompanied by the passage of stringent new gun legislation in the British parliament; yet serious questions remain unanswered about both incidents, Ed.) ]      And what is that crisis???
