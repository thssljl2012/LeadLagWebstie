  is this the type of change  for which you've hoped?        quote:  Grand Jury Probes Richardson Donors New Mexico Financing Fee       By Martin Z. Braun and William Selway      Dec. 15 (Bloomberg) -- A federal grand jury is investigating how a company that advised Jefferson County, Alabama, on bond deals that threaten to cause the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, did similar work in New Mexico after making contributions to Governor Bill Richardsons political action committees.      The grand jury in Albuquerque is looking into Beverly Hills, California-based CDR Financial Products Inc., which received almost $1.5 million in fees from the New Mexico Finance Authority in 2004 after donating $100,000 to Richardsons efforts to register Hispanic and American Indian voters and pay for expenses at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, people familiar with the matter said.      The Federal Bureau of Investigation asked current and former officials from the state agency if any staff members in the governors office influenced CDRs hiring, said the people, who declined to be identified because the proceedings are secret. Richardson, who is President-elect Barack Obamas designate for Commerce Secretary, has a staff of at least 30 people.      Theyre looking at everything related to CDR, William Sisneros, the finance agencys chief executive officer, said of the FBI probe. Theyre just trying to evaluate all the relationships to see what CDR was doing for the money.      Nationwide Investigation      The investigation reflects another front in nationwide efforts by U.S. prosecutors to investigate so-called pay- to-play in the municipal bond market. The term refers to banks and advisers who make political contributions or personal gifts to public officials in return for fee-paying financing assignments.      On Dec. 1, Birmingham, Alabamas mayor, Larry Langford, was charged by federal prosecutors with soliciting $235,000 in loans, expensive clothes and jewelry from Montgomery, Alabama-based bond underwriter Blount Parrish &amp;amp; Co. Langford, the former president of the Jefferson County Commission, included the firm on bond and derivative deals that netted it about $7.1 million. CDR, which wasnt named in that indictment, advised Jefferson County on the derivatives.      The New Mexico probe comes two years after the FBI searched CDRs offices as part of a nationwide investigation into whether banks and advisers conspired to overcharge local governments on financing deals. That probe by the New York office of the U.S. Department of Justices Antitrust Division is ongoing, and CDR says it is cooperating.      No Complaints      A company spokesman denied wrongdoing in New Mexico.      To suggest that theres a pay for play element is just inaccurate, said CDRs Allan Ripp. There was no involvement by the governor. CDR knows for certain that they were selected on the basis of their track record.      New Mexico finance authority officials havent complained about the companys advisory work.      Richardson, a 61-year-old Democrat, is a former U.S. Energy Secretary who ran for president in 2008. He served 15 years in Congress and was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 1997-98. He was a consultant to Salomon Smith Barney Inc., a unit of New York-based Citigroup Inc., from July 2001 to January 2003.      Elected New Mexicos governor in 2002 and re-elected in 2006, Richardson appoints five directors to the New Mexico Finance Authoritys 12-member board, including the chairman. Five other directors are members of his cabinet.      CDRs Contributions      CDR made $1.48 million advising the authority on interest-rate swaps and restructuring escrow funds for $1.6 billion of transportation bonds issued by the agency, according to state records.      Interest-rate swaps are derivatives, or contracts whose value is derived from assets including stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, or from events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. Borrowers use them to lower costs and reduce their exposure to swings in interest rates.      In October 2003, CDR President David Rubin gave $25,000 to Moving America Forward Inc., a political action committee formed by Richardson, disclosure forms show. Seven months later, CDR, known then as Chambers, Dunhill, Rubin &amp;amp; Co., gave $75,000 to Si Se Puede! Boston 2004 Inc., formed to help pay expenses at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, where Richardson was chairman.      Cooperation Expected      The Governors Office is aware of questions surrounding some financial transactions at the New Mexico Finance Authority, said Gilbert Gallegos, a spokesman for Richardson. We expect any state agency that is approached with federal officials to cooperate, he said, declining to comment further. Calls to Richardson were directed to Gallegos.      Darrin Jones, an FBI spokesman, declined to comment, as did Norman Cairns, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorneys office in Albuquerque. CDRs lawyer, Richard Beckler, a partner at Howrey LLP in Washington, declined to comment. Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined to comment.      A member of the agencys board, Craig Reeves, said he was asked by federal agents about hiring CDR and whether the donations had any role.      Many Things Discussed      That was one of many things we discussed, he said, declining to comment on the specific scope of the investigation. He said no one at the governors office discussed retaining CDR with him when the decision was made.      One of the people called to testify before the Albuquerque grand jury said federal investigators asked if Richardsons office directed the state agency to select CDR. Investigators also asked about how responses to a request for investment advisory services were scored.      Another person familiar with the probe said the thrust of the investigation is whether people in Richardsons office influenced the selection of CDR. The person said the U.S. Attorney identified subjects of the investigation, not targets, which means prosecutors have yet to gather substantial evidence linking anyone to a crime.      To be charged with a felony, a person has the right to be indicted by a grand jury, the U.S. Constitution says. The panel of 16 to 23 people is meant to act as a buffer between prosecutors and their suspects, said James Montana, a former federal prosecutor and partner with Chicago-based law firm Vedder Price.      Grand Jury      Acting in secrecy mandated by law, grand juries review documents and hear evidence from victims, witnesses and occasionally the subjects of the investigation.      While the Justice Department will sometimes give a target notice of an investigation and invite that person to appear, neither step is required and such appearances are extremely rare, said Montana. To indict, 12 of the grand jurors must agree there is probable cause a crime was committed.      CDR advised the New Mexico Finance Authority on the purchase of swaps from New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co., UBS AG of Zurich and Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto as part of Richardsons $1.6 billion transportation proposal in 2003.      GRIP Bonds      Richardsons plan -- known as GRIP, Governor Richardsons Investment Partnership -- called for refinancing more than $400 million of the states existing transportation debt and selling new bonds through the finance agency to pay for improvement projects. CDR earned $951,566 for advising on derivatives tied to the bond issues and $443,265 for restructuring the escrow funds of the refunded bonds, agency documents show.      David Harris, the executive director of the state finance agency when the interest-rate swaps were done, was Richardsons deputy chief of staff before he was appointed to the agency. He was also interviewed by the FBI, said Paul Kennedy, his lawyer. Kennedy declined to comment further.      CDR was hired after responding to a Dec. 30, 2003, request for proposals from the New Mexico Finance Authority for investment advisory services.      Splitting the Mandate      Six companies answered the request, which contained two questions out of 39 items related to experience with interest-rate swaps and guaranteed investment contracts. A joint venture from Smith Barney and New York-based Ryan Labs Inc. received the top score of 99 percent. CDR had the second-highest score of 97 percent, authority records show.      Rather than select the Smith Barney/Ryan Labs team as both investment and swap adviser, the authoritys then- Chief Financial Officer, Keith Mellor, recommended splitting the mandate. The agency gave the swap adviser job to CDR, which received the same score as the Smith Barney/Ryan Labs team on the swap section of the proposals, authority records show.      The chair of the committee that recommended CDRs selection, Rick Homans, declined to comment. At the time, Homans was the Secretary of New Mexicos Economic Development Department. He now serves as the secretary of the Taxation and Revenue Department.      IRS, SEC      In a March 10, 2004, memo to the finance authoritys board, Mellor said the agency chose CDR as swap adviser because it specialized in assisting state and local governments, including the University of New Mexico, with derivatives. The authoritys board approved the selections at its meeting later that month.      It may not be surprising that the state would have split the assignment based on what they measured or assessed to be respective strengths, CDR spokesman Ripp said.      CDR, which Rubin founded in 1986, has been involved in investigations by the Internal Revenue Service, Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice into whether banks and brokers conspired to rig bids on municipal derivatives and profit from deals at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.
