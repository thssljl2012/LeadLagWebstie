 Dow below 7,000 Blue-chip measure drops to levels not seen since 1997 as AIG reports biggest quarterly loss in corporate history, government revamps rescue. By Alexandra Twin, CNNMoney.com senior writer Last Updated: March 2, 2009: 1:48 PM ET  NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Stocks slumped Monday afternoon, with the Dow falling to its lowest point in nearly 12 years after insurance company American International Group's massive quarterly loss battered the financial sector. The Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) lost 256 points, or 3.6%, with over 2 hours left in the session. The Dow had dropped as low as 6,804.39, its lowest trading level since April 28, 1997.  The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) index lost 30 points, or 4.1%. Earlier, it fell as low as 704.27, its lowest level since Nov. 4, 1996.  The Nasdaq composite (COMP) lost 47 points, or 3.5%. The tech-fueled Nasdaq has held up better than the other major averages this year and remains above its session low of 1,295.48 from Nov. 21, 2008. The stock losses Monday were in response to AIG, but also a continuation of the worries about the financial sector and the economy, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services. "There are reverberations from AIG and also the continued uncertainty around the financial sector as a whole, which is the chorus that never ends," he said.  "That's paired with the second chorus that never ends - the weakness of the global economy," he said. "It's reflected in the weakness in the industrial, material and energy stocks today." AIG: AIG reported a $62 billion fourth-quarter loss, the largest in U.S. corporate history, on turmoil in the credit markets and massive restructuring costs. For the full year, AIG lost $99 billion after reporting a profit of $9.3 billion in 2007. To keep the company from collapsing and infecting the broader financial market, the government is revising its bailout for the third time and committing another $30 billion in exchange for cumulative preferred stock. The rescue plan now totals $162.5 billion. (Full story) Stocks tumbled Friday after the government said it will control as much as 36% of Citigroup's common stock. Also in play: a report showing the economy shrank at its sharpest pace in 26 years in the fourth quarter of 2008. Buffett: Adding to the weakness was billionaire investor Warren Buffett's annual chairman's letter, in which he talked about the tough 2008 his Berkshire Hathaway company experienced. The influential investor admitted that he "did some dumb things in investments" during the year. Stock movers: AIG dragged on other financial stocks, including Bank of America (BAC, Fortune 500), Wells Fargo (WFC, Fortune 500), Morgan Stanley (MS, Fortune 500), Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM, Fortune 500). The KBW Bank (BKX) sector index lost 6.3%. General Electric (GE, Fortune 500) continued to retreat after saying Friday it is cutting its dividend by 68% to 10 cents per share from 31 cents. 29 of 30 Dow stocks fell, led by the banks, GE, GM (GM, Fortune 500), Caterpillar (CAT, Fortune 500) and Alcoa (AA, Fortune 500). Market breadth was negative. On the New York Stock Exchange, losers beat winners by 13 to one on volume of 1 billion shares. On the Nasdaq, decliners topped advancers five to one on volume of 1.30 billion shares. Economy: The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index rose to 35.8 in February from 35.6 in January, after 12 months of declines. Economists expected a drop to 34, according to a Briefing.com survey. Despite the advance, the sector remains in a period of contraction, with any reading under 50 indicating weakness. Another report showed that construction spending fell 3.3% in January after falling 2.4% in December. Economists thought it would fall 1.5%.
