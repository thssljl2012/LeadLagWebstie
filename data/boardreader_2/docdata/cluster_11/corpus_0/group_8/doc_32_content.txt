I recently wrote that folks in Orange County, as well as the entire U.S., are ignoring their credit -card bills at higher rates, though 90-day delinquencies remain close to 1 percent. Well, the latest data from some big credit-card issuers shows they are classifying more debt as unrecoverable. According to Reuters and public filings:  American Express, the largest U.S. charge-card operator by sales volume, said its net charge-off rate rose to 8.70 percent in February from 8.30 percent in January and 7.5 percent in December. Citigroup, one of the largest issuers of MasterCard cards, said its default rate soared to 9.33 percent in February, from 6.95 percent a month earlier JPMorgan Chase, a big issuer of Visa cards, reported its charge-off rate rose to 6.35 percent in February from 5.94 percent in January. Capital One Financial&#8217;s default rate increased to 8.06 percent in February from 7.82 percent in January.  Reuters confuses the issue by using &#8220;charge-off&#8221; and &#8220;default&#8221; interchangeably, but I believe it means to say charge-off for each of the companies. Charge-offs are the defaults that can&#8217;t be recovered. And looking ahead Reuters says: Analysts estimate credit card chargeoffs could climb to between 9 and 10 percent this year from 6 to 7 percent at the end of 2008. In that scenario, such losses could total $70 billion to $75 billion in 2009. In other news&#8230;  Obama to propose tougher finance rules  What type of mortgage jobs are opening?
