Another down week with Dow almost touching 7000 (if not, it would this week). 3rd bailout for Citibank at expense of common shareholders. What's going on in this supposedly capitalist nation?One lesson I learned from these bank bailouts. It's best to be debt-holders or preferred shareholders (except for Fannie and Freddie preferred) since everyone is out to screw common shareholders. Check out Citibank on Friday. It's common stock (C) fell by 40% while its preferred (C-M, C-P) jumped by 30%. I have started studying (and investing) in preferred for some time but have not been aggressive enough.Here are benefits of investing in preferred over common:They have superiority over common. They would get impacted only after all common gets wiped outMost times, they pay dividend at around 6-8% per annum. At today's prices, they yields could be above 20% when they pay dividendsGovernment is buying preferred when they bail-out companies like C, BAC. So it's better to be on Government's side since it would not do deals which would be self-damaging (we hope)If and when these companies come out of this mess, preferred would trade closer to their face value (typically $25). For example, if Bank of America survives, BAC-H which is trading at $8 would go to $25 nearly for more than 200% gain.There are many interesting plays in preferred - here are some I am watching: C-M, BCS-D, BAC-H, IND, INZ, IDGFor this week's recommendation:Symbol: IDGBuy Price: $5.5 to $ 6Target sell price in 12 months: $12Information:ING Groep N.V., 7.375% ING Perpetual Hybrid Capital Securities, liquidation  amount US$25 per share, redeemable at the issuer's option on or after 10/15/2012  at US$25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, and with no stated  maturity. Distributions of 7.375% ($1.84375) per year are paid quarterly. In addition, dividends can be deferred (cannot be cancelled)As expected, GE cuts dividend to 10 cents. It still gives yield of 4.5% at $8.5. I would still recommend GE for long-haulHave a good weekend !/Shyam                     ...
