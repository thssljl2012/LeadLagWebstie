Once again, there&#8217;s bad news from the markets: A day after breaking a five-day losing streak, Wall Street fell to new lows on Thursday as investors reacted to more concerns about the fate of General Motors, dreary retail sales and news that China did not appear poised to increase its stimulus spending. Renewed concerns about the financial industry were reflected in big declines for the biggest banks. Shares of Bank of America and Citigroup each fell 11 percent, with Citigroup shares briefly trading below $1. JPMorgan Chase was down 14 percent, and Wells Fargo lost 17 percent. But the broad sell-off dragged all sectors of the market lower. Producers of basic materials like metals and chemicals, whose shares rose Wednesday on speculation about Chinas stimulus spending, fell back, as did transportation companies. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 6,594.44, down 281.40, or 4.1 percent  its lowest close since April 15, 1997. The broader Standard &#038; Poors 500-stock index was down 4.25 percent, to its lowest ebb since September 1996, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq index was off 4 percent. Stocks in Europe also closed sharply lower. We&#8217;ve got the potential for another bad day tomorrow depending on what comes out of the unemployment figures that will be released around 8:30 tomorrow morning.
