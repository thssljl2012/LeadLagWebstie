Well, the markets are staging a reversal so far today.   Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening: Citibank is up BIG today.   Why?  Because their CEO says that they are making a profit and that their capital position is just fine.   Well, I ask you, if their capital position is so strong, why did we just have to give them another $36 Billion last week?   I don&#8217;t expect the Citibank euphoria to last. Due to the flow of money back into the stock market, rates have edged up a bit today.  We&#8217;re at 5.375% for a 30 year 0 pts refi and 5.125% for a 30 year 0 pts purchase (both with 720 credit scores).    On a 15 year, we&#8217;re at 5.125% and 4.875% for a purchase and a refi respectively. Recommendation - If the Citibank led rally holds, I recommend locking rates.   However, I don&#8217;t believe that the rally today will hold, so I&#8217;m leaning toward floating at the moment.   I suspect that the reality of the situation is:  The markets are going to realize that they don&#8217;t have a solid situation in the banking world yet. The trend is going to reverse. Rates will probably adjust back down to yesterday&#8217;s levels.  So I&#8217;d describe today as a &#8220;cautious float.&#8221; Stay tuned,Tom Vanderwell  Morning Market Update Post from: Straight Talk About Mortgages and Real Estate  If you are reading this anywhere other than your RSS Feed or on my site, please contact me at tvanderwell@straighttalkaboutmortgages.com.
