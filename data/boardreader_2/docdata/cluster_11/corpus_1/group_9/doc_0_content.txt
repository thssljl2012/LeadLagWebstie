NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday  as data on home sales and manufacturing added to hopes that the  economic slump was moderating, prompting investors to scoop up  bank shares.  The data offset negative sentiment arising from a report  showing job losses in the private sector accelerated in March,  reviving worries of high unemployment, as well as fears that  struggling automaker General Motors could be headed for  bankruptcy.  Factory activity in March shrank, but at a slower pace than  the month before, while pending sales of existing homes rose  modestly in February, but the housing market remained weak as  values continued to decline.

'I would call it somewhat encouraging. It's not a major  improvement but it feels ... that the rate of decline is  diminishing,' said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at  Raymond James Financial in St Petersburg, Florida.  'I've been doing this for 38 years and it feels to me like  the worm has turned.'  Market watchers were also focused on the Group of 20 summit  in London as leaders of the world's top economies meet to  tackle the global economic crisis.  Shares of GM fell 5.7 percent to $1.83 following a  New York Times report that the Obama administration is seeking  to ease GM into a 'controlled' bankruptcy by persuading some  creditors to agree to a plan that would split the company into  two pieces.  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.83 points,  or 0.73 percent, to 7,664.75. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index gained 5.19 points, or 0.65 percent, to 803.06. The  Nasdaq Composite Index added 8.98 points, or 0.59  percent, to 1,537.57.  The broad S&amp;P was up more than 17 percent from 12-year lows  hit in early March and on Tuesday closed out the month at its  best since October 2002. The rally has been fueled by hopes  that the economy is showing signs of stabilization.  Financial shares turned around following the  manufacturing and homes data to be the top boost on the S&amp;P,  gaining 1.4 percent. JPMorgan Chase was up 4 percent at  $27.65 while Bank of America gained more 4.7 percent to  $7.14.  On the downside, Boeing was among the Dow's top  drags, down 1.5 percent at $35.05, after Wachovia Capital  Markets cut its rating on the commercial aerospace sector,  including Boeing, to 'market perform', citing expectations of  lower aircraft deliveries starting next year.  On Tuesday, GM said there was a rising chance it could file  for bankruptcy by June. The comments came on the heels of the  ouster of its Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wagoner, and  details of the U.S. administration's plans limiting taxpayer  funds for automakers.  While U.S. President Barack Obama played down differences  between G20 leaders meeting in London, Germany and France  demanded tough action rather than weak compromises,  highlighting the difficulties in reaching an accord on staving  off recession and tightening regulation.  On the Nasdaq, Celgene Corp was among the biggest  weights, shedding 14.4 percent to $38.00 after several  brokerages cut price targets for the biotechnology company.
