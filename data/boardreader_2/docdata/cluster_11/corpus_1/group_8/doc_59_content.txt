Alcoa Inc. dropped the most in three months after Bank of America Corp. cut the company's share-price target by half and said the 2009 loss may be wider than the bank expected. Alcoa fell 98 cents, or 16 percent, to $5.26, the biggest decline since Nov. 20. The shares have plunged 86 percent in the past year. The share-price target for Alcoa was lowered to $3 from an earlier estimate of $6, Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit said in a note to clients. The aluminum producer may post an annual loss of as much as $1.50 a share, more than an initial estimate of 20 cents.
