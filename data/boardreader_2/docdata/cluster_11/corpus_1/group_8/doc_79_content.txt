NEW YORK - Investors have gotten used to bad news, but layoffs topping 600,000 a month still made for a volatile day on Wall Street.   Stocks rose, fell, then clawed their way back to a mixed close yesterday after the Labor Department released its February jobs report.   But while the market finished well above its lows - the Dow Jones industrials had a modest gain after falling more than 120 points - many market watchers say there's no reason stocks can't slide lower, even as the major indexes are near 12-year lows.   News of continuing struggles in the banking industry and concerns about General Motors Corp.'s survival are only intensifying the market's uneasiness. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. became the latest bank to cut its dividend, and the market waited to see if GM would be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.  The Dow rose 32.50, or 0.5 percent, to 6,626.94. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 0.83, or 0.12 percent, to 683.38, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.74, or 0.44 percent, to 1,293.85.   Wells Fargo cut its dividend to 5 cents a share from 35 cents, following last week's move by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to reduce its dividend to 5 cents as well.   Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. had already slashed their quarterly dividends to a penny per share. The banks are expecting loan losses to increase because of the recession.   Wells Fargo shares rebounded yesterday by 49 cents, or 6 percent, to $8.61. Citigroup, which fell below $1 a share for the first time Thursday, rebounded by a penny to close at $1.03.   But most other financial stocks slumped. JPMorgan dropped 67 cents, or 4 percent, to $15.93, Bank of America slipped 3 cents to $3.14, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell $6.07, or 7.4 percent, to $75.65, and Morgan Stanley fell 80 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $17.18.   GM dropped 41 cents, or 22 percent, to $1.45.
