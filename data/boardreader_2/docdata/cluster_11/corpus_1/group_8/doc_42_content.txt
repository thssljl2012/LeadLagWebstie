 TOP MARKET NEWS  (RTTNews) - Stocks are seeing some strength during mid-morning trading on Tuesday, as investors hunt for cheap stocks following recent weakness. Nonetheless, disappointing housing data has helped to limit the upside for the markets.  On the economic front, pending home sales fell by much more than expected in the month of January, according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday, with some potential homebuyers waiting for clarity on housing stimulus provisions.  NAR said its pending home sales index fell 7.7 percent to 80.4 in January from a downwardly revised reading of 87.1 in December. Economists had been expecting a much more modest decrease of about 3.5 percent.  With the monthly decrease, the index is down 6.4 percent compared to the same month a year ago, at its lowest level since tracking began in 2001.  In corporate news, Bank of America (BAC), which received $45 billion in federal aid to survive the financial crisis, reduced the compensation for its chairman, CEO and president Kenneth Lewis by about 60 percent in 2008, according to a regulatory filing.  The company also said that no year-end cash incentives, restricted stock, or stock option awards would be handed out to Lewis or any other executive officers for their performances in 2008.  Separately, AutoZone Inc. (AZO) reported that its second quarter net income increased 8.6 percent to $115.86 million from $106.71 million in the year ago quarter.

Meanwhile, in remarks before the Senate Budget Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the U.S. may need to expand the $700 billion rescue fund, but he feels that with work the markets can become stable and lead to a lasting recovery.
