By Kiran Stacey   in New York   US stocks slumped to new lows for the year yesterday in New York, wiping out the gains made during a bullish previous session.Financials once again led the way after Moodys, the ratings agency, warned that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, three of the largest US banks by capitalisation, may face credit-rating downgrades. JPMorgan's stock fell 10.1 per cent to $17.35 on the news and Bank of America slid 11.7 per cent to $3.17. Wells Fargo, which continues to drop on worries that it will cut its dividend, lost 18 percent to $7.92.   Citigroup was also caught in the selling, with fears over its creditworthiness reflected in record highs in the price of insuring against the bank defaulting on its debt. Yesterday morning, it cost $525,000 to insure against $10m of Citigroup's debt. Its shares dipped below $1 for the first time in the company's history, but by midday were 11.5 per cent down at exactly $1.00. The banks were further hit by news that mortgage delinquencies were up by 1 percent, with one in every eight US households ending 2008 behind on their mortgage payments or in the foreclosure process. "Financials were not involved in Wednesday's rally and have continued to slide", said Randy Frederick, director of trading at Charles Schwab.   The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index fell 3.8 percent to 685.79, its lowest since September 1996, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.3 percent to 6,647.65 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 3.1 percent to 1312.12. Shares in metals stocks fell after rising during Wednesday on talk that the Chinese government was ready to introduce a fresh stimulus package to encourage spending. The announcement never came, and three of the previous session's biggest winners all fell back slightly, although the assertion from Chinese premier Wen Jiabao that the country would meet its 8 per cent growth target for the year meant they didn't give up all of Wednesday's gains. Alcoa, the alumunium maker, fell back 11.4 percent to $5.53. Nucor, the steel maker, lost 5.5 percent to $32.81 and Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 2.8 percent to $31.32.   The news from China also brought the oil price down after its strong performance on Wednesday, hampering energy stocks. The sector lost 4 percent with Chevron falling 3.5 percent to $57.22 and Exxon Mobil giving up 4.1 percent to $62.97.   Meanwhile there was yet more bad news for the distressed automotive industry.Auditors for General Motors said there was "substantial doubt" that it could continue to function as a going concern. Even though the assessment had been expected, its confirmation sent GM shares down 16.8 percent to $1.83.   Ford said that it would look to negotiate a debt-for-equity swap with its creditors. The prospect of such equity dilution sent its shares down 3.7 percent to $1.80. General Electric looked set to continue taking a battering following a torrid day on Wednesday, during which the company's shares briefly dipped to their lowest level since 1991. But Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, was able to reassure the markets that the company did not need new capital, and its shares picked up, gaining 0.8 percent to $6.74.   Budget retailers continue to perform well, and after the previous day's profits from Big Lots beat expectations, Wal-Mart yesterday reported a 5.1 percent rise in February sales at US stores open at least a year, higher than analysts had predicted. The company's stock rose 2.7 percent to $49.79. But Wal-Mart's figures disguised a wider slump in retail sales, which fell 4.8 percent in February compared with the same time a year ago, once Wal-Mart had been excluded. Hewlett-Packard bucked the recent outperformance by technology stocks after a report from research firm IDC said that PC sales would fall 4.5 per cent this year worldwide. HP shares fell 3.2 per cent to $20.47.
