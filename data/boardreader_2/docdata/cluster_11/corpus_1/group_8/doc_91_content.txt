Following the lead of other major banks, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. said yesterday it will slash its dividend by 85 per cent in an effort to save $5-billion (U.S.) annually. The San Francisco-based bank said it will cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents from 34 cents. The next dividend is expected to be declared in April. Last month, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents from 38 cents. In January, Bank of America Corp. slashed its quarterly dividend to 1 cent from 32 cents. And troubled Citigroup Inc. has lowered its quarterly dividend to 1 cent from 16 cents. There is concern that losses related to Wells Fargo's acquisition of troubled Wachovia Corp. will be bigger than anticipated. In recent weeks, its stock has taken a beating as investors fear it could be the next big bank in need of a government bailout. WFC (NYSE) rose 49 cents to $8.61.
