 AM CST  NEW YORK  Investors have gotten used to bad news, but layoffs topping 600,000 a month still made for a volatile day on Wall Street.  Stocks soared, sank and then clawed their way back to a mixed close today after the Labor Department released its February jobs report.  Employers cut 651,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate jumped to 8.1 percent. The government also revised its December and January job loss figures up to 681,000 and 655,000, respectively. Many market participants had been bracing for even worse readings.  Still, the major indexes remain down sharply for the week and near 12-year lows. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 6.2 percent for the week, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is down 7 percent. Both have fallen more than 24 percent since the start of 2009.  And many market watchers say there's no reason stocks can't slide further.  'My sense is we haven't discounted all the negatives out there as of yet,' said Rob Lutts, president of Cabot Money Management.  Big institutional investors are still largely waiting for positive signs from the economy before making any major commitments. As a result, the market is largely being driven by 'short' traders, who sell borrowed stock and then buy it back later in hopes that the price will decline in the meantime. That makes for a choppy, unpredictable market.  According to preliminary calculations, the Dow rose 32.50, or 0.5 percent, to 6,626.94. The SP 500 index rose  0.83, or 0.12 percent, to 683.38, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.74, or 0.44 percent, to 1,293.85.  The Nasdaq is down 6.1 percent for the week, and at a six-year low.  Banks continued to slash their dividends in anticipation of more loan losses this year.  Wells Fargo &amp; Co. today cut its dividend to 5 cents a share from 35 cents, following last week's move by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to reduce its dividend to 5 cents as well. Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. had already slashed their quarterly dividends to a penny per share.  Wells Fargo shares rebounded today by 18 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $8.30. Citigroup, which fell below $1 a share for the first time Thursday, rebounded by a penny to close at $1.03.  But most other financial stocks slumped. JPMorgan dropped 67 cents, or 4 percent, to $15.93, Bank of America slipped 3 cents to $3.14, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell $6.07, or 7.4 percent, to $75.65 and Morgan Stanley fell 80 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $17.18.  GM shares continued their freefall as speculation about the automaker's future swirled. On today, members of the Obama administration's auto task force met again with the company's stakeholders.  GM shares dropped 41 cents, or 22 percent, to $1.45.  Bond prices were mixed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.88 percent from 2.81 percent late Thursday. The yield on the three-month T-bill fell was flat at 0.20 percent.
