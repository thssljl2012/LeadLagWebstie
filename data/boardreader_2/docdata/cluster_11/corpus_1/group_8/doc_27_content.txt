(RTTNews) - The Taiwan stock market has finished higher now in three straight sessions, collecting nearly 130 points or 3 percent in the process. The Taiwan Stock Exchange broke through resistance at 4,550 points on Friday, but now investors are bracing for a day of sharply lower trade to halt the winning streak at the opening of trade on Monday.  The global forecast for the Asian markets puts forth more pessimism, thanks in large part to bleaker than expected economic data out of the United States. More uncertainty among the corporate sector added to the negative sentiment, as the European markets ended Friday's session sharply lower, as did the U.S. markets - and the Asian bourses are predicted to follow that lead, opening the fresh trading weak with more downside pressure.  The TSE finished modestly higher on Friday, boosted by gains among some of the technology issues. For the day, the index added 38.59 points or 0.85 percent to close at 4,557.15 after trading between 4,507.39 and 4,564.32 on volume of 68.85 billion Taiwan dollars. There were 1,132 gainers and 454 decliners, with 245 stocks finishing unchanged.  Among the gainers, Chinatrust Financial rose 0.47 percent, while MediaTek rose 4.11 percent, Hon Hai Precision gained 2.05 percent, AU Optronics added 2.16 percent and Chi Mei Optoelectronics closed up 0.44 percent.  Bucking the trend, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co fell 0.11 percent, while United Microelectronics Corp lost 1.38 percent, Taiwan Cement closed down 0.57 percent, Wei-Chuan Foods shed 1.37 percent and Cathay Financial lost 1.58 percent.  Wall Street offers a broadly negative lead as stocks ultimately ended Friday's trading day lower after showing a steep decline in early trading, although off their worst levels of the day. The initial weakness came as investors responded to troubling news from the banking sector and a weaker than expected reading on economic activity.  On the economic front, GDP for the fourth quarter contracted by much more than previously anticipated, according to a report released by the Commerce Department, with the data suggesting considerable economic weakness in the last three months of 2008. The report showed that gross domestic product fell 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the previously reported 3.8 percent decrease. Economists had been expecting fourth quarter GDP to be revised to show a 5.4 percent decrease. The contraction in the fourth quarter marked the weakest quarter since a 6.4 percent decrease in GDP in the first quarter of 1982.  In corporate news, Citigroup (C) and the U.S. government reached a deal for federal funds to be used to increase the government's stake in the bank. Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. government agreed to hold up to 36 percent of Citigroup's common shares in order to improve the company's capital base. The U.S. Treasury agreed to convert up to $25 billion in government-held preferred shares in the bank to common equity. As a provision of the deal, private investors are required to contribute an identical sum. While reports regarding the government's increased stake in Citigroup generated some buying interest earlier in the week, traders sold on the news amid renewed concerns about the nationalization of some of the nation's biggest banks.  Meanwhile, Kenneth Lewis, CEO of Bank of America (BAC), testified in a meeting with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office for four hours Thursday regarding the bonuses given to employees of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. just before its merger last year.  After showing a lack of direction throughout the afternoon, the major averages all ended the day firmly in negative territory. The Dow closed down 119.15 points or 1.7 percent at 7,062.93, the Nasdaq close down 13.63 points or 1 percent at 1,377.84 and the S&amp;P 500 closed down 17.74 points or 2.4 percent at 735.09. With the losses, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 fell to their worst closing levels in over ten years, while the Nasdaq set a three-month closing low. The major averages also showed steep declines for the week and the month of February. The Dow fell 4.1 percent for the week and 11.7 percent for the month.
