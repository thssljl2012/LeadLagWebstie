Dow Jones closed at its lowest level since August 1997 on renewed fears about the financial sector and also General Motors as its auditor warned 'there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern,' sending its share price into a tailspin.  Dow Jones finished down 281 points at 6,594 after persistent and steady selling all day. Nasdaq shed 54 at 1,299, while the S&amp;P 500 was down 30 at 682.  The Dow is now down over 50% since its high in October 2007, while this year's 21.6% fall is the worst ever start to a year in the index's history.  GM started the rout as its accountant Deloitte &amp; Touche said 'Recurring losses from operations, stockholders' deficit and inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations and sustain its operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern'.  Sentiment was already unsettled by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's growth target of 8% for China in 2009 as he did not announce another stimulus plan, as hoped for, on top of the $586bn plan already underway.  Meanwhile, in Europe, the ECB decided to cut interest rates by half a percentage point, while the Bank of England halved its interest rates to an historic low of 0.5%. Even so, financial stocks top a beating with Citigroup shares falling to below $1.  In other company news, Wal-Mart Stores said sales rise in February beat expectations while other retailers, such as Wet Seal Inc. and Limited Brands, saw declines that were less than anticipated.
