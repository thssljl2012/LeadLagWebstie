that initial unemployment claims fell more than anticipated last week failed to buoy stocks. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters/IFR predict the Labor Department on Friday will report that U.S. employers slashed 648,000 jobs in February  more than the 598,000 jobs cut in January. 'We know that there are lots of job losses,' said independent market analyst Edward Yardeni. 'The initial claims data didn't change that perception.' Rising unemployment is of particular concern because it means many consumers have less to spend. And consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is crucial to helping the economy turn around. A handful of better-than-expected retail sales reports, including one from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., weren't enough to convince investors that consumer spending is improving.  The future of General Motors also plagued investors. The automaker said in its annual report that auditors raised serious doubt about its ability to continue operating. GM has already received $13.4 billion in federal loans, and is seeking a total of $30 billion from the government. GM dove 39 cents, or 17.7 percent, to $1.81.  Negative comments from Moody's Investors Service weighed on already depressed financial stocks. Concerns about capital levels led the ratings agency to downgrade the ratings of Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Moody's also lowered the outlook on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s ratings to negative. Bank of America shares dropped 35 cents, or 9.8 percent, to $3.24; Wells Fargo plunged $1.42, or 14.7 percent, to $8.24; JPMorgan tumbled $2.38, or 12.3 percent, to $16.92.  Government bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 2.82 percent from 2.98 percent late Wednesday. The yield on the three-month T-bill, considered one of the safest investments, slipped to 0.21 percent from 0.25 percent Wednesday.  Gold prices advanced, even as the dollar rose against other major currencies.  Light, sweet crude fell $1.08 to $44.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Markets overseas were mostly lower. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 3.2 percent, Germany's DAX index dropped 5 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 4 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2 percent after Wall Street's Wednesday rally, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1 percent.
