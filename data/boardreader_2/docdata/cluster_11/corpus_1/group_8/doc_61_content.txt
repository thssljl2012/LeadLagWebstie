Stocks on the move Real-Time Equity news U.S. stock market report 0858 ET 05March2009 VIX stays in neutral range of 38-53 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The CBOE Volatility Index, the implied volatility measure of the S&amp;P 500, fell 3.37 to close at 47.56. The VIX in a neutral range between 38 and 53, and 'so it isn't giving a signal one way or the other at this time,' said Larry McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp in a note to clients. Volatility derivatives barely moved at all on Wednesday, which was not very good confirmation for the rally. VIX futures trade at discounts, and the term structure remains steep, he said. 'The breadth oscillators are still oversold and other indicators related to breadth or the momentum of the recent selloff are short-term bullish,' he said. But McMillan said he continues to be wary of the lack of sentiment -- as evidenced by mediocre readings on the put-call ratios and VIX, and also from the fact that 'nearly every trader we talk to is bullish. Everyone is trying to buy the bottom here. They may all be right, but we have some reservations.'
