Stock prices fell another 4 percent Thursday as investors continued to fear that bellwether stocks like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) may be on the brink of failure or bankruptcy. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 281.40 points to 6,594.44, a new 12-year low.

Nasdaq shares dropped 54.15 points to 1,299.59 and the S&amp;P 500 stock index lost 30.32 points to 682.55, its lowest close since 1992. Investors made it clear that they believed the best place to be was on the sidelines ahead of Friday's release of jobs data by the Labor Department. It is estimated payroll could have declined in February by as many as 700,000 jobs. Shares of General Motors dropped to $1.86, down 34 cents, after an auditor's report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission raised questions about the ability of the company to remain a viable business. Gold prices also finished down on the day. Crude dropped $1.26 to $44.12 a barrel. Stocks rallied Wednesday for the first time since Feb. 24 on speculation China would broaden efforts to boost growth and U.S. lawmakers will reach agreement on a plan to stem mortgage defaults. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Thursday the country's 8 percent growth target for this year is within reach, indicating the government doesn't see the need to increase a 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) economic stimulus.

Moody's said it will review the long-term debt ratings of Wells Fargo and Bank of America on concern higher credit costs may damage capital ratios. S&amp;P downgraded JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, along with 11 other banks, on Dec. 19. The firm cut Bank of America again Tuesday, saying the bank's earnings might be lower than estimated in December because of more credit losses. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) dropped 0.5 percent to $6.66, the lowest price since November 1992, even after the company said its finance unit will be profitable this year. GM slumped 15 percent to $1.86. The largest U.S. automaker said its auditors made a 'going concern' ruling, meaning they are unsure the company will remain in business. GM also disclosed a 'material weakness' in its accounting procedures. 'GM is weighing on things because it's an extraordinarily large employer and it has financial involvement with large institutions,' said Uri Landesman, who manages $2.5 billion at ING Investment Management Inc. in New York.

(NYSE: GS) economist Binit Patel forecast Thursday that the world economy will shrink 0.6 percent this year, three times faster than a prior forecast. Industrial companies and makers of consumer goods slid as the global recession weighs on demand for everything from air travel to clothing and computers. An index of S&amp;P 500 companies that rely on consumers' discretionary spending declined 4.7 percent to the lowest level since September 1996 even as the U.S. government released better-than-expected jobs data. The Labor Department said 639,000 Americans filed claims for jobless benefits, the fifth straight week above 600,000. That marks the worst performance since 1982. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimated jobless claims of 650,000 for the week that ended Feb. 28.
