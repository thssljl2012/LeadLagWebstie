LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded their gold and silver forecasts, lifting their spot gold forecast for 2009 to $1,000 an ounce from $875, the 2010 gold forecast to $1,050 an ounce from $900, the 2009 silver forecast to $14.50 an ounce from $11 and the 2010 silver forecast to $15 from $11. 'We believe the outlook for precious metals is much more promising. Increasing inflation expectations, a shift toward liquid assets, a rapid increase in credit risk, falling stock markets, and a wave of monetary and fiscal policies are contributing to fuel a rally in gold prices,' the broker said. The broker upgraded Iamgold  (IAM:  News , chart , profile , more  Last:  Delayed quote data  Add to portfolio  Analyst  Create alert  Insider  Discuss  Financials  , , )  to buy from neutral but lowered Hecla Mining  (HL:  News , chart , profile , more  Last:  Delayed quote data  Add to portfolio  Analyst  Create alert  Insider  Discuss  Financials  , , )  to underperform from neutral.
