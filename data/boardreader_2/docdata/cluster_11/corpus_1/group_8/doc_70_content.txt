Slower revenue growth, higher expense levels, increased credit costs and shareholder dilution from another potential capital raise represent earnings headwinds for the company, Arnold said.   RBC Capital Markets' Jon Arfstrom said he is modestly surprised by the cut as the quarterly dividend was not a significant capital drag for the company and it may signal a more pressing need for capital sooner than expected.  The analyst estimated that the dividend cut retains about $9 million in tangible capital annually for the company.  The company said it will pay a dividend of 1 cent a share on March 31 to stockholders of record on March 17.  PrivateBancorp previously paid a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents a share.  The company provides personalized financial services primarily to entrepreneurial and middle-market companies, affluent individuals, wealthy families, professionals, entrepreneurs and real estate investors.   Dozens of U.S. lenders, including Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc and U.S. Bancorp, have reduced or eliminated dividends to preserve capital for covering rising credit losses.  Shares of PrivateBancorp fell 8 percent to $9.85 in midday trade on Nasdaq. The stock, which had touched a low of $9.65 earlier, has plummeted more than 80 percent since touching a high of $49.50 in September.
