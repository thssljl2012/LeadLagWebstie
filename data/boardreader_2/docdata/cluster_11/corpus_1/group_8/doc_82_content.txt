Traders and Specialists work the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday, March 6, 2009.  NEW YORKWall Street gave up an early gain and turned lower Friday after a jobs report that was bad but not as horrific as many traders feared.  The Labor Department said Friday employers cut 651,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate jumped to 8.1 percent. The government also upwardly revised its December and January job loss figures to 681,000 and 655,000, respectively.  The readings were worse than analysts' estimates. Many market participants, however, had braced for even grimmer data, and so the market had an early bounce. But analysts believe there is little keeping them from sinking further.  'My sense is we haven't discounted all the negatives out there as of yet,' said Rob Lutts, president of Cabot Money Management. He added that investors have to account for not only the gloomy data from the government and companies, but also the pessimism of other participants in the market.  'It's not a scientific process by which stock prices are set,' he said. 'They're set by people. People are extremely emotional beings.'  The market has been plummeting this week through barrier after barrierthe Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index tumbled more than 4 percent Thursday to its lowest close since September 1996.
