'What we have so far is not a workable basis for a decision,' he said on Deutschlandfunk radio, adding that the government was aware of its responsible and was prepared to live up to them if necessary. 'But we can't make decisions that are irresponsible on a completely inadequate basis,' he said.  Opel is hoping to get state aid as it faces one of the worst markets in decades.  In the United States, shares of GM, a Dow component, sank 15 percent to $1.87 after its auditors raised 'substantial doubt' about its ability to survive outside bankruptcy if it fails to stem its losses or stop burning cash.
