(SmarTrend via COMTEX) -- WMT   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- The plan to forestall home mortgages announced by the President yesterday was viewed more favorably than the stimulus bill signed the day before, and the stock market halted its downward slide. The DJIA was flat for the day, slithering along at its November low at 7,500. The market is due for a bounce up today because several SmarTrend(R) indicators are oversold.  Despite the favorable impression generally made by the larger-than-expected $75 billion plan to bail out failing home mortgages for up to 9 million American families, revised Fed economic forecasts, a troubling outlook for GM (NYSE:GM) kept buyers at bay. This was reflected in the second day in a row of polarization to the downside by the daily SmarTrend(R) uptrends to downtrends, which came in at 7:149. Such continued absence of buying pressure caused the IBDI and Trend Ratio to fall further, confirming the intermediate-term downtrend is adding to the downward pressure on the market indices. The IBDI is oversold, and is likely to stay that way for at least the next week, and the Trend Ratio has further room to decline. None of this provides much encouragement that the long-term downtrend can confirm a bottom at the DJIA 7,500 level, which is now at risk to go lower.  However, the near-term trend indicators are moving into position to spawn a brief rally. Two of the indicators, the SmarTrend(R) Ratio and the NBDX, are oversold and typically would not be expected to remain in their oversold territories more than a few days. However, they may stay oversold until early next week when the NBDI and NBDV are expected to stop declining as they too reach their oversold territories.  In the meantime, the trade-term trend is ready to bounce up today, also driving the market indices moderately higher. There are several economic reports due out today, including unemployment claims published this morning and discussed below, which, after digestion, could change the trade-term trend direction rapidly. Nevertheless, the market indices are positioned to rebound somewhat even if it is a brief trade-term trend bear market rally, one not likely to catalyze a multi-day near-term trend upward rotation today, although such an uptrend is likely to commence early next week.

Stocks remained poised to threaten November bear-market lows yesterday as investors battled between their crises of confidence and basic instincts for low-value purchases. Economic numbers read poorly as housing starts and building permits sank to record lows, industrial production fell more than expected for the sixth straight drop in seven months, and the Fed revised its economic forecast downward, noting a significant risk that economic recovery could be delayed. Promising news of the government's foreclosure plan and General Motor's (NYSE:GM) restructuring proposal fell short of countering concerns that systemic meltdown risks remain to banks and through them to Main Street consumers, already impacted by layoffs, stock price declines and reduced home equity values. The S&amp;P 500, off 12.7% year-to-date, remained essentially flat in Wednesday trade, off 0.1% to its lowest level of the year. The DJIA gained 3 points, as the Nasdaq fell 0.2%. NYSE volume turned light as 1.4 billion shares traded hands, and decliners outpaced advancing shares by 2 to 1. Treasury prices sold off in advance of next week's expected heavy auction schedule; the price of the 10-year bond fell 1 1/32 to a yield of 2.770%.  Component action of the DJIA was mixed, with financials' declines leading. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) shares fell 6.7% and Citigroup (NYSE:C) 4.9%. General Motors (NYSE:GM) fell 5.5% on concerns over its short-term cash needs. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) shares fell 3.9% reflecting commodity price declines. Among the gainers, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) shares continued higher, up 3.7%, on strength of its attraction to value- hunting consumers, and was joined by a 1.3% rise in McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) on its value meal appeal. Intel (NASD:INTC) shares rose 1.1% on news of its investment in three United Arab Emirates technology firms. Among S&amp;P sector movements, only technology (+0.3%) and consumer goods (+0.1%) sectors recorded gains, as declines were led by utility (-1.4%), telecommunications (-1.2%), basic materials (-0.7%), and industrial (-0.5%) sectors. According to the latest Bloomberg tabulations, profits at the 379 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting results since January 12, profits fell 33% on average, for the sixth straight quarterly decline, the longest on record. In yesterday's late news, DJIA component Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) disappointed with inline fourth quarter profits of 93 cents ex-items, but a revenue miss on sales of $28.8 billion, lower than the estimates of $31.9 billion. With over half of its business from overseas, much of the decline was attributed to the rising dollar, with sizeable declines cited in its computer, printer, and imaging and service business. For the second quarter, projections are for earnings of 84-86 cents, as revenues drop 2-3%. Deere (NYSE:DE) also disappointed as weak demand and increased raw material costs held fiscal first quarter results to 48 cents versus 83 cents a year earlier, missing Street estimates of 63 cents. The firm also lowered its full-year projections to earnings of $1.5 billion from its earlier $1.9 billion.  The housing market outlook remained bleak as still-falling home prices and rising foreclosures limited builders' interest in new projects. January US housing starts and building permits sank to record lows, with starts declining at a sharper-than-expected 16.8% annual rate to 466K units, and building permits dropped 4.8% to 521K units. Industrial production fell by a greater-than-anticipated 1.8% during the month, marking the sixth monthly decline in seven, on continued disintegration in auto sales, and capacity utilization fell to 72%, its lowest since February 1983. Even with Obama's pledge of a larger-than-expected $75 billion in homeowner relief, $200 billion in new assistance for Fannie Mae (NYSE:FNM) and Freddie Mac (NYSE:FRE), and help for 5 million homeowners on top of banks' agreements to defer foreclosure proceedings, housing shares were shunned, with KB Homes (NYSE:KBH) down 5.8%, DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) off 5.4%, and Centex (NYSE:CTX) off 5.1%.  Even as the bleak earnings and economic data were posted, little was said to alleviate fears the recession might prove longer and deeper than anticipated. In the FOMC minutes, the Fed revised its projections lower and upped the odds that the recovery could come later and prove weaker than initially thought. Now expecting GDP to contract 0.5%-1.3% in 2009, the Fed placed 2010 growth at 2.5%-3.3%, 2011 growth at 3.8%-5%, with long-term growth at 2.5%-2.7%. Today's calendar covers a look at wholesale prices in January (8:30 AM ET), with steady fuel costs expected to result in PPI headline numbers up 0.2%, following December's 1.9% drop; core prices are expected up 0.1%. Weekly initial jobless claims (8:30 AM ET) are expected to post above 600K for the third week straight at 610K. At 10:00 AM ET the Philly Fed is expected to post a slight February increase to -25 from -24.3; leading indicators are expected up 0.1% in January. And at 11:00 AM ET crude inventories are expected to post another weekly rise.
