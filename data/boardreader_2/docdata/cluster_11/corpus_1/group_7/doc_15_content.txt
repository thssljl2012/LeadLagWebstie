  Sectors:Financial Services   Banks  Companies:Bank of America Corp   Goldman Sachs Group Inc   Morgan Stanley  John Melloy  Senior Editorial Producer  Fast Money  Who's going to pay back the TARP first? The first bank to do this will likely see its stock skyrocket. We've been trying to game this on the show ever since the Goldman CFO said last week that he hopes to pay back Joe the Plumber by the end of this year. (No coincidence his comments came a day after news of Obama's 500K pay-cap broke.)  Bloomberg News highlights in a story today that the stakes in this race just got a bit bigger after the public flogging the CEOs took yesterday.  I mean who would want to go through this again?  Plus, whoever is last in this race may not even get the chance to pay the taxpayer back, if you know what I mean.  The traders are handicapping this race, with an eye more on the capital markets names. Pete Najarian bought Morgan Stanley  loading...    [MS Loading...   ()  ] on Wednesday, along with Guy Adami. Joe Terranova is playing the exacta through the SPDR KBW Capital Markets ETF  loading...    [KCE Loading...   ()  ], whose top holdings are Goldman and Morgan Stanley. Of the eight TARP takers today, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs  loading...    [GS Loading...   ()  ] are down the least.  Viewers, surprisingly, are putting their money behind Bank of America  loading...    [BAC Loading...   ()  ]. I guess the reasoning is that they won't pay back first, but they will pay it back eventually and the stock has the most upside considering it's $5 and Goldman is $92.  ______________________________________________________  John Melloy is the Senior Editorial Producer for Fast Money.
