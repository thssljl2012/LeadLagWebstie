The fear that Aviva would be forced to cut its dividend payment this year made it one of the market&#146;s biggest casualties as profit-taking in financial stocks continued for a second day.     The Norwich Union insurer had recovered 75 per cent from the 163.3p low it reached last month, after it took &pound;500 million off its dwindling capital reserves in order to maintain its dividend for 2008 &#150; but it lost 20&frac12;p, or 7.5 per cent, to end the day at 253&frac12;p as HSBC reiterated its &#147;underweight&#148; advice.

It was all part of a mood swing that began on Monday after Bank of America revealed a jump in the amount that it was having to set aside for customers defaulting on mortgage payments.
