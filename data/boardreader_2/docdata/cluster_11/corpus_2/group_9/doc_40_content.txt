They are geared, so be careful what you buy and sell.    I have made many mistakes, however, I have made 46 percent profit, after commissions, interest and dividends paid, in the last four weeks.      Some tips on mistakes I have made.   1. Do not panic.  - That's why you need a plan.    2. Do not use emotion when buying shares  - See above    3. They are a tool to make money, not lose money.  - But it is easier to lose money than make money consistantly.    4. If you buy a stock and it starts to drop right after you buy it-pause go back to why you bought it in first place. Do not   - When do you know you were wrong and exit the trade though?    5. Always stick with shares that pay dividends. Unless you want to spectate.  - Spectate or speculate , Shares rise or fall whether or not they pay a d/e.    6. Remember, there are thousands of traders who look for short selling profits,   causing shares to peak and trough.   7. Do not follow the crowd and pump your hard earned money into shares like Telstra and BHP. Telstra is going nowhere, it has been around for along time and it does not explode in prices, except on bad news generally. BHP is alright for very, very conservative investors, do not expect great massive returns.  - BHP has gone from $20 - $32 in 5 months and that's not a massive return? It also pays a d/e     8. Buy stocks that are underpriced, pay dividends, and have exceptional management behind them. Example MQG coughing up a dividend soon, these shares have gone from $15.80 five weeks ago to trading today at $26.45. BEN is another sound share, underpriced, not a major bank, so alot of the market noise is filtered out. Five weeks ago,trading at $6.80 now $7.85. Recently  paid dividend a couple of days ago.  - Plenty of stocks in that boat atm but how do you identify the good from the bad?    9. If you see a profit to be made- MAKE IT! Regardless of how much more you think you can make, everyone else is out there to make money, not hold shares for twenty years and see them rise and fall, take BHP for example, some people have held them for years, they could have sold them back in MARCH and made profits, like CBA, you hear stories trading at $63.00. Do not get emotionally attached to shares, they are shares, not pets.  - How do you know they aren't still in profit. Could have brought BHP for under $10 in early 2003 and received d/e's in that time as well.       That is about all I can think of.    Kind Regards   Ted                                             I understand what you are trying to say but there are some serious holes in your theories especially for trading CFDs imo. No money management or trade management for starters.      You've made some good profits during this last bullish period but how much are you going to give back during the next down leg?
