       Some relevant comments by Santoli in today's Barron's:  &lt;&lt;There are a couple of practical impacts on tape-reading and indexes from the prevalence of stocks priced like items on a fast-food value menu. One is that trading volume -- typically expressed in total shares traded -- has been even less impressive than the tepid readings of late, given that they translate into even lower dollar volume.  Much levity has been derived lately from the observation that the Dow industrials' four financial stocks -- Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and American Express (AXP) -- together account for a mere 400 of the Dow's 8000 points, owing to their low average share price. All four could go to zero and cost the Dow a mere 5%.  While this may seem an indictment of the Dow's value in representing the market (and granting that its price-weighting methodology hasn't made much sense since the days when computation was done with graphite and graph paper), it's not terribly different from the S&amp;P 500, where banks are only 2.5% of total market cap, and diversified financials kick in 5% more.  The component mixes of the Dow and S&amp;P have made some difference in relative performance, though hardly a large one. At the market's high of October 2007, the ratio of the point value of the Dow to that of the S&amp;P was 9.6, versus just over 9 now.&gt;&gt;
