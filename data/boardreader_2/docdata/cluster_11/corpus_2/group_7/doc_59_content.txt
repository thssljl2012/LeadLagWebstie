Hello!      Just curious what the general consenus is on purchasing BAC on the NYSE. It has obviously taken a huge beating lately, at less than $4.00 per share with an average of $40/share over 10 years or so, will it bounce back over a few years, or will it disappear?      I don't see the Bank of America going completely under, so would you like to buy?
