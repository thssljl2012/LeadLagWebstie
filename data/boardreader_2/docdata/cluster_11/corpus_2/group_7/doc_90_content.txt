          If the view is that gold isn't a safe haven, then the price will collapse.   Not the stereotypical libertarian/goldbug then eh Nick? ;)   I think this is what is so compelling about gold.. Should fiat currencies collapse, and protectionist measures be taken to devalue currencies in a beggar thy neighbour fashion, just what else *is* a safe haven?   I'd say any *real* assets.. but not all such assets are convenient to own (e.g. food, property, oil, uranium - except for related equities of course) and what assets have a high perceived value to weight ratio and are relatively easy to own with low counterparty risk?   Not that much .. gold seems a pretty obvious choice to park at least some of your capital in this kind of scenario.  Tom.
