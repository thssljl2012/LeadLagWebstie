         Gold, money is just a mechanism of exchange.  ie. Fiat money is good for as long as people accept fiat money in exchange for goods and services  The same is true for gold. Otherwise its just another raw material.   What's going on at the moment is that people are having doubts about fiat, and so are moving to gold.   The protection that gold offers is predicated on people accepting that gold has value as a means of exchange. ie. I've some gold, give me some goods/services or fiat money to the same value  There is nothing inherantly special about gold as a means of exchange.  Gold however does make a good means of exchange. It's dense and compact. It doesn't go off. It is hard to get hold of.  Nick
