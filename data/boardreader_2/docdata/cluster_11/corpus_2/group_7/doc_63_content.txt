No, I would not.   There are so many other companies that have been beaten down,  but  they are good, quality companies.        So I'd rather buy those.   Sure BAC may not go bankrupt, but it doesn't mean that its stock price will recover when the market goes back up.      Things like JnJ, P&amp;G, Shoppers, etc.   these have been beaten down as well, but will recover back when the economy turns around.  So I'd rather buy these.      Or if you like financial sectors, why not buy an ETF for financials instead?   Safer than just betting on one BAC
