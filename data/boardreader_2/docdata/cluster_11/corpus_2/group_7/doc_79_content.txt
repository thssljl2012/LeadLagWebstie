       Fidelity's business is primarily as a custodian, the accounts are separate.  I don't think it is possible to have an IRA with a foreign bank or brokerage (you end up in the US subsidiary of the bank).  What might useful would be to have more than one IRA account, and move some - maybe 10-40% - to a different company.  This would provide an option should there be a computer problem at Fidelity.  See news story on the software bomb planted at Fannie Mae recently.  I might be useful to pick one of the major banks which are currently getting TARP funds. I would avoid Citi, JPMChase, and BofA  -  that leaves Wells Fargo, US Bank, and a number of others.   If Fidelity goes, and takes the custodial accounts (more likely the government would grab them, as in Argentina), we will bypass the need for gold, and go to the need for canned food and shotguns.  So my answer is yes, Fidelity is safe.  Government grabs are more of a worry, including taxation of IRAs.
