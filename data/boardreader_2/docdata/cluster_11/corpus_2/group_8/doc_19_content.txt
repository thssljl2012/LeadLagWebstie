         An Honorable company would have cut the dividend to ZERO rather than cutting the dividend from $1.24 per year to $0.40 per year. Many, many pension Funds in their Charter prohibit holding shares of companies that do not pay a dividend, or are forced to sell shares when the company cuts a dividend drastically - a 50% dividend cut is a common  automatic SELL Rule .  Bank of America(BAC) was even less honorable - BAC cut the dividend from a significant amount 9%+ yield to four cents per share per year. Some General Electric retirees have 100% of their GE Pension benefit in General Electric stock. Thanks for NOTHING  Straight From the Gut  Jack Welsh.  Kahuna, CFA  KCFA IS NOT a Jack W.
