Brazil Stocks Drop on Concern Over Metals Demand; Bolsa Slides                       By Alexander Ragir    March 5 (Bloomberg) --    Brazilian stocks    fell for the first time in three days, led by steelmakers, on concern Chinese growth may not be enough to sustain metals demand as the global recession deepens.        Cia. Vale do Rio Doce    sank 3.3 percent after Bank of America Corp. stripped the worlds biggest iron ore miner of its buy rating.    Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA    fell the most in two months after Nippon Steel Corp. said it hasnt decided on buying more shares of its Brazilian rival.    Gerdau SA   , Latin Americas largest steelmaker, slumped 4.5 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the global economy will shrink more than it previously estimated.     I continue to be fairly worried about steel, said    Jacopo Valentino   , who oversees $2 billion in Latin American stocks at BNP Paribas Asset Management in Sao Paulo. Im optimistic about China, but the U.S. and Europe is whats worrying.     The    Bovespa    index fell 2.6 percent to 37,420.85 at 11:19 a.m. New York time. The gauge surged 5.3 percent yesterday, following gains in stock and commodity markets around the world, after a former official said Premier    Wen Jiabao    would announce a new spending plan. Wen said today that Chinas 8 percent expansion target for this year is within reach, indicating he doesnt see the need to increase its $585 billion stimulus.     The stock market went to a party yesterday and the band never showed up, wrote    Peter Boockvar   , equity strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co. in New York, in an e-mailed note today. Thats how I feel after Chinas Premier Wen did not announce another stimulus plan.     Regional Drop     Stocks dropped around the region after a 6.6 percent rally in the    MSCI EM Latin America Index    yesterday. Mexicos Bolsa lost 3 percent, while Chiles Ipsa retreated 2.3 percent.

Vale fell 94 centavos to 27.36 reais. Bank of America cut its rating on the miner to neutral, citing significant downside risk in iron-ore demand from regions besides China.     The market usually associates Vales iron-ore demand to China, but China represents only 29 percent of Vales shipments, analyst    Felipe Hirai    wrote. We see a significant downside risk on iron-ore demand in the other regions.     Shrinking Economy     Goldman Sachs now expects worldwide gross domestic product to shrink 0.6 percent in 2009, compared with a previous forecast for a 0.2 percent contraction, London-based economist    Binit Patel    said today in a report to clients.        Usiminas    tumbled 5.8 percent to 25.05 reais after surging the most in almost three months yesterday amid speculation Nippon Steel may take control of the company.
