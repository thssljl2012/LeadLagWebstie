Market Update:   1:05 pm  : A weak close in the prior session opened the door for sellers to regain control over stocks. The stock market has since reversed the prior session's rally, touching fresh multiyear lows in the process.    Weakness was further fueled by news that Moody's is reviewing the credit ratings of  Bank of America  (BAC 3.28, -0.32) and  Wells Fargo  (WFC 8.05, -1.61), while  JPMorgan Chase  (JPM 17.26, -2.04) had its outlook lowered.      1:30 pm  : The Dow is now down 24% year-to-date, while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen slightly less since the start of the year. The Nasdaq is down almost 17% for the year.   Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 400 Mid-cap Index and Russell 2000 Small-cap Index are showing year-to-date losses of 23% and 29%, respectively.   Worse yet, the Dow Jones Transportation Index is down 36% for the year, and the Amex Airline Index is down 47%.

Losses are deep and broad-based.    The upside to the losses, however, is that stocks are looking oversold, as they were ahead of the prior session's rally. Given that the general direction of trade continues to move lower, it will likely take an encouraging headline to drive short sellers to cover their positions.    Since the short trade has become such a crowded position, market pundits believe that a short squeeze could turn into a strong rally, especially if the move attracts money from the sidelines.
