Wells comments boost banks and broader sector   By Greg Morcroft Mar 6, 2009 10:02:00 (ET)   NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Wells Fargo and Co. shares rose about 8% and helped lift the broader banking and financial sectors after it said its business has been strong in the first two months of the year, and that it expects its integration of Wachovia Corp to cost less than previously expected.  Wells ( WFC , Trade ) is the second bank this week, after Bank of America ( BAC , Trade ), to say that first-quarter business is strong.  That helped lift the broad the KBW Bank ETF ( KBE , Trade ) by almost 4%, and helped the Financial Select Sector SPDR ( XLF , Trade ) ETF, which tracks the financial stocks in the S&amp;P 500, rise 3%.  Wells also cuts its dividend 85% in a move it said would help it strengthen capital levels and pay of the government's recent investment in the firm.  While a dividend cut would normally weigh on shares, Wells cut was not unexpected, and market participants seemed to agree with the firm that in the short term the capital is better spent trying to untangle itself from the government investment.
