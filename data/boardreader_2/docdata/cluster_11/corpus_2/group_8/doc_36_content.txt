 Stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher opening Friday as the passage of the economic stimulus package looked imminent      Wall Street was still digesting details of the government's economic stimulus plan.      With the stimulus package close to a vote, Congress agreed late Thursday on  a "strong" Buy American provision  that would see much of the public works in the $789 billion bill going to US companies.

The plan is due Tuesday from GM, which also refuted reports that it was preparing to sell its stake in a joint venture with Shanghai's SAIC Motor.

Bank shares were mostly lower premarket, with  Bank of America  dropping 2 percent.       PepsiCo  shares gained 1 percent premarket after the company reported a sharp loss in quarterly profit but met Wall Street expectations of 46 cents a share.

"I think there's a chance for a run up to the recent highs of 870 (on the S&amp;P 500)," David Jones, chief market analyst at IG Index, told "Worldwide Exchange."       But the market really needs a stronger catalyst and could be stuck in a trading range until more big-name earnings come out, Jones added.      Also Thursday, Republican Sen.  Judd Gregg of New Hampshire withdrew his nomination as commerce secretary , citing conflicts with President Barack Obama's handling of the stimulus package.
