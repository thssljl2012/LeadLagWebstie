 RGR Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              Message for chief    Martin Weiss said to be sure to copy this from his     blog today and send it to you---    -------------------------------------------------                GM IS ON ITS DEATH BED:  Two years ago, I warned you that General Motors was headed for bankruptcy. This morning GM&#8217;s own auditors revealed an unnamed &#8220;material weakness&#8221; in the company&#8217;s accounting &#8212; and warned that there&#8217;s   serious doubt the automaker will survive  .            BANK OF AMERICA, CITIGROUP AND AIG ARE ON LIFE SUPPORT:  As soon as dire realities force the Washington to pull the plug, these giant institutions will be in bankruptcy.             GENERAL ELECTRIC IN THE ER:  S&amp;P has already issued a negative outlook on GE&#8217;s debt and, this week, Moody&#8217;s is considering slashing the company&#8217;s credit rating &#8212; a strong signal that the company may soon be fighting for its life.             JPMORGAN CHASE NEXT?  This morning, Moody&#8217;s slashed its outlook to negative. Ditto for Wells Fargo.          To me, JPMorgan Chase is the most worrisome of all.       Remember: It holds $91.3 trillion in derivatives &#8212; a notional value that&#8217;s 40.6 times its total assets. Moreover, these include $9.2 trillion credit default swaps, hands-down the riskiest form of derivatives.      Worse, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency warns that JPMorgan Chase Bank is  also  exposed to extremely large credit risk with its derivatives trading partners: For each dollar of capital, the bank has credit exposure of $4.00 &#8212; nearly twice the average exposure of Bank of America and Citibank.      BOTTOM LINE: America&#8217;s four largest banks &#8212; JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America and Wells Fargo &#8212; are ALL major threats to our nation&#8217;s future and to your money!       The broad picture is equally bleak &#8230;        Bloomberg just reported that, the AVERAGE S&amp;P company suffered a massive 58% plunge in earnings in the last three months of last year.       Moody&#8217;s Investors Service now predicts that corporate bond defaults will more than triple this year &#8212;  and exceed the levels seen during the great depression!       JPMorgan itself is warning that AT&amp;T Inc. ... DuPont ... Textron and 20 other huge non-financial companies will likely cut or eliminate their dividends in an effort to survive.      The Fed, meanwhile, is only  now  truly admitting something&#8217;s wrong. After first predicting that the crisis &#8220;would end in 2008&#8221; ... then postponing their recovery forecast until the first half of 2009 ... and then delaying it again until the second half of 2009 ...       Ten of the Fed&#8217;s 12 district banks have just warned that they now see   no hope of a bottom or recovery until the end of the year or in 2010.
