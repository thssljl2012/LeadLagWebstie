   Accounting scandals, rights issues in spotlight          By R SIVANITHY     SENIOR CORRESPONDENT     Published March 14, 2009        AT the start of the week, it would have been a safe bet that few in the market would have heard of Oriental Century (OC), a China-based education services provider (schools, colleges, kindergartens, etc) whose shares are listed here.        By Friday, it would have been an equally safe bet that almost everyone would have heard of OC because of its announcement about its faked accounts and non-existent cash balances.        The main players hurt would be those who have been punting S-chips, or China companies listed here, on the basis that they are low-priced and therefore 'cheap'.        Those who base their buying decisions on this criterion - and we know plenty of 'long-term' investors would count among them - have of course failed to consider the reasons why these stocks have crashed to below 20 cents and in many cases, below 10 cents.        OC's shocking announcement on Thursday of cooked books actually came as no real surprise given that there had already been many rumours circulating about the dodgy accounting practised by S-chips, rumours which undoubtedly led to the segment gradually collapsing over the past year.        Of course not all S-chips are guilty of shady accounting and fake book-keeping but when sentiment is bad, all would logically be tarred by the same brush.        As a result, the top volume (and percentage losers) list over the week was liberally populated by S-chips such as Synear Food, China Hongxing Sports, Sino-Environment and Sino Tech.        In a special report on S-shares, Credit Suisse yesterday pondered the very real likelihood that having cash is now a liability.        'Our work shows that of the 90 S-shares with net cash, nearly 40 per cent have market caps that are lower than their latest historical net cash. That is, investors are arguably getting their core businesses for nothing . . . However, rising cases of accounting irregularities means that the market is no longer sure of the attractiveness of the investment case here,' said Credit Suisse.        It added that valuations will remain depressed, which clearly is not good for the Singapore Exchange.        Also prominent over Thursday and yesterday was Raffles Education (RE), which owns about 30 per cent of OC. Analysts appear divided over the outlook for the stock; for example, Credit Suisse yesterday maintained an 'outperform' because of RE's sound fundamentals and 31 per cent compound annual growth rate for earnings, while CLSA called a 'sell'.        'We maintain our negative outlook on RE and expect 18 per cent profit contraction in FY10. Without new acquisitions, FY10 will be the first year that the company's growth will be driven by only organic opportunities . . . we don't believe the company will be able to put in place any new fee increases,' said CLSA. The stock gained two cents yesterday at 36 cents; for the week, it was down 4.5 cents.        Among the week's top stories was Chartered Semiconductor, which early in the week announced a 27-for-10 rights issue at seven cents per share, at a time when the stock was trading at about 20 cents.        Although not totally unexpected, the news immediately sent the stock plunging and, over the course of the week, it crashed 48 per cent or 12 cents to 13 cents. Most brokers responded by calling a 'sell' with fair values of 6-11 cents; Bank of America-Merrill Lynch ranked among the minority with a 'buy' and 39 cents target price.        As for blue chips, yesterday's 83.99-point jump to 1,577.52 was certainly impressive as bear rallies go.        For the week, the index gained 64 points or 4.2 per cent, though once the short-covering ceases and economic/earnings realities take hold, it's very likely that the downtrend will resume, probably as soon as next week.
