Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Merrill Lynch all dropped after a Goldman Sachs analyst predicted the companies might write-down a further $US34 billion ($A39 billion) in assets linked to subprime mortgages.   KB Home and Macy's led builders and retailers lower after falling US home prices and sales heightened concern that sinking property values will slow consumer spending.       Lower-than-forecast orders last month for durable goods and an unexpected rise in jobless claims last week added to evidence that the housing slump is spreading to the broader economy. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index has dropped 3.2% since the end of September, cutting its growth in 2007 to 4.2%.   The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.4% to 1478.49 last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.6% to 13,365.87. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.7% to 2674.46.   The declines left the S&amp;P 500 5.5% below its all-time closing high of 1565.15 on October 9.   The US Commerce Department said orders for cars, aircraft and other durable items increased 0.1% last month, less than the 2% median economist estimate in a Bloomberg survey.

Financial shares in the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.4% last week, bringing their 2007 decline to 21%, the biggest annual plunge since 1990.
