Wells Fargo need not cut dividend - analyst Bove 03/05 10:45 AM BANGALORE, March 5 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC:$8.2800,$-1.3800,-14.29%) does not need to cut its dividend from an operating standpoint, veteran analyst Richard Bove said, following much speculation about whether the bank will be able to sustain its current payout. Wells Fargo (WFC:$8.2800,$-1.3800,-14.29%) shares fell 14 percent to $8.34 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. However, the market has already assumed that the bank will cut its dividend, the Rochdale Securities analyst told Reuters by phone. Many analysts expect Wells Fargo (WFC:$8.2800,$-1.3800,-14.29%) to cut its $1.36 per share annual payout, which is higher than the company's expected earnings for 2009. Wells Fargo (WFC:$8.2800,$-1.3800,-14.29%) remains the largest traditional U.S. commercial bank not to have lowered its dividend during the credit crisis. "Wells Fargo (WFC:$8.2800,$-1.3800,-14.29%) is going through a Citi-like situation wherein the company takes action dictated by the market rather than those necessary," he said. Wells Fargo's (WFC:$8.2800,$-1.3800,-14.29%) dividend payout has been the subject of much speculation as financial institutions have slashed dividends to preserve capital. Dozens of U.S. lenders, including Bank of America Corp (BAC:$3.335,0$-0.255,0-7.10%) , JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM:$17.931,0$-1.369,0-7.09%) , Citigroup Inc (C:$1.02,00$-0.11,00-9.73%) and U.S. Bancorp (USB:$9.54,00$-1.47,00-13.35%) , have reduced or eliminated dividends to preserve capital for covering rising credit losses.
