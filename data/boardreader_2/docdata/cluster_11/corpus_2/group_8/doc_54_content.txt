 BAC Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Everyone seems to think that Q1 will be a turn around for BAC, or if they can make it through Q1 then BAC will be ok ... but things are going from Bad to Worse quickly with no end in sight         Ken Lewis and Joe Price already said things were going to be "Awful" in 2009 with most of their loss predictions based upon unemployment in JANUARY of 8% for the ENTIRE YEAR ... but only 30 days later Ken was back on the wire now saying unemployment is expected to be 8% to 8.5% ... the Feb employment report was 8.1% with massive revisions higher to Dec and Jan and Feb is also expected to be revised much higher at the next report in March.         Q1 2009 is an unmitigated disaster for Ken.  This is his worst case scenario.  Joe Price report at the Q4 CC in Jan:               "we would expect the consumer credit card net loss ratio to increase as well and probably exceed unemployment levels by at least 100 basis points and be further impacted by decreasing loan levels"                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aTitTMcMFNI8&amp;refer=home          Awful Year        This is going to be an awful year for the credit card industry, Bank of America Chief Executive Officer    Kenneth Lewis    told lawmakers this month. The more optimistic views are unemployment at 8 or 8.5 percent, and that would cause very high loss rates in the credit-card portfolios.               --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------               http://seekingalpha.com/article/115373-bank-of-america-corporation-q4-2008-earnings-call-transcript?page=-1     Bank of America Corporation Q4 2008 Earnings Call Transcript     January 19, 2009         Managed net losses in the consumer portfolios were 3.46% versus 2.89% in the third quarter. Managed consumer credit card net losses represent 54% of total consumer losses. Managed consumer credit card net losses as a percent of the portfolio increased to 7.16% from 6.4% in the third quarter. 30 day plus delinquencies in managed consumer credit card increased 79 basis points to 6.68% while 90 day plus delinquencies increased 28 basis points to 3.16%.     We have continued to see increased delinquencies across our card portfolio even more so in the states most affected by housing problems. California and Florida make up a little less than a quarter of our domestic consumer card book but represent about 1/3 of the losses. Clearly with unemployment levels projected to go beyond 8% in the U.S. we would expect the consumer credit card net loss ratio to increase as well and probably exceed unemployment levels by at least 100 basis points and be further impacted by decreasing loan levels.     Credit quality in our consumer real estate business also continued to deteriorate from the third quarter. Our largest concentrations are in California and Florida which combined represent about 40% of the home equity portfolio and represent about 65% of the losses. Home equity net losses increased approximately $149 million to $1.1 billion or 2.92% versus 2.53% in the prior quarter. 30 plus performing delinquencies increased 47 basis points to 1.75% while NPAs increased 41 basis points to 1.86%.
