Market Update 090304 http://biz.yahoo.com/mu/update.html 4:30 pm : The stock market logged new multiyear lows during the session, and closed at its worst level since the fourth quarter of 1996. Roughly 95% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 finished with a loss. Though losses were broad-based, financials were dealt the worst blow. The sector fell 9.9% with particular weakness among diversified banks (-16.5%) and other diversified financial services companies (-13.2%). Moody's announced it is reviewing the credit ratings of Bank of America (BAC 3.17, -0.42) and Wells Fargo (WFC 8.12, -1.54) for possible downgrade. Moody's lowered its outlook for JPMorgan Chase (JPM 16.60, -2.70) to negative from stable. Sellers pushed both WFC and JPM shares to new multiyear lows. Citigroup (C 1.02, -0.11), which is a Dow component, registered record lows by falling below $1 per share. Despite the weakness plaguing financial stocks, General Electric (GE 6.66, -0.03) resisted much of the session's sweeping selling efforts. Concerns about the health of the company's capital arm have made the stock perform as if it were a financial holding. The company's CFO stated in a CNBC interview that GE does not need capital, helping calm concerns for at least the time being. Automakers continue to struggle amid stiff macro headwinds. General Motors (GM 1.86, -0.34), also a Dow component, was hammered as fears of bankruptcy mounted after the company's auditor expressed concerns about GM's viability. Given GM's pleas for federal financing, market participants were already well aware of the automaker's problems. Retailers had an ugly session after a battery of companies reported ugly same-store sales for February. Gap (GPS 10.21, -0.45), Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF 18.24, -2.69), American Eagle (AEO 9.13, -0.81), and Nordstrom (JWN 12.23, -1.36) all reported double-digit declines. However, companies catering to more cost-conscious consumers reported increased same-store sales. Aeropostale (ARO 23.09, -0.02), Wal-Mart (WMT 49.75, +1.26), and Family Dollar (FDO 30.66, +3.39) were the stand-outs. Family Dollar complemented its report with upbeat guidance, while Wal-Mart increased its dividend. In the past Wal-Mart has been considered a bellwether for retailers. However, the market recognizes that the discount retailer's strength is a reflection of consumer weakness, which is rooted in depreciating home values, falling stock prices, and rising job losses. Weekly jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 28 totaled 639,000. Continuing claims came in near 5.11 million. Though claims weren't as high as expected, job markets remain weak. With job losses mounting, many homeowners are unable to stay current on their mortgage payments. In turn, mortgage delinquencies as a percentage of total loans totaled 7.88% in the fourth quarter. That was up from the 6.99% delinquency rate in the third quarter. Fourth quarter nonfarm productivity declined 0.4%, though it was expected to increase 1.2% after the prior reading showed a 3.2% increase. The lower reading was a result of lower economic output in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, fourth quarter unit labor costs increased 5.7%. Economists expected a 3.8% increase. Factory orders for January fell 1.9%, which is a less severe drop than the 3.5% decline that was widely expected. The drop in factory orders reflects the retrenchment by businesses in the wake of softer spending. European markets also traded lower Thursday. Germany's DAX dropped 5.0%, Britain's FTSE fell 3.2%, and France's CAC finished 4.0% lower. The European Central Bank lowered its target interest rate 50 basis points to 1.50%, as expected. The Bank of England lowered its target interest rate to 0.50% from 1.00%, in-line with expectations. The Bank of England also announced it will begin buying assets in order to increase the country's money supply. Meanwhile, China's government said it will target 8% economic growth this year, though officials didn't satisfy participants by providing additional details on its stimulus plans. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.0%. Japan's Nikkei advanced 2.0%.

Energy commodities also traded with marked weakness. April crude oil experienced selling pressure and closed at $43.30 per barrel, down 4.6%. April natural gas futures closed at $4.08 per contract, down 6%. The contracts closed just a penny above their session lows. Gold was one of the few bright spots this session. The flight to safety was apparent today as April gold futures closed up 2.3% at $927.80 per ounce. May silver also attracted buyers as it managed to climb 1.6% for the session to close at $13.12 per ounce.DJ30 -257.42 NASDAQ -43.36 SP500 -29.11 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 2273/425/1.8 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 2878/236/1.3 bln 3:00 pm : There is just one hour remaining before the closing bell tolls, and the major indices continue to trade at session lows. More than 3,100 stocks are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and 530 of them are trading at new 52-week lows. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumber advancers by more than 10-to-1. The stock market is currently down some 7% week-to-date.DJ30 -265.55 NASDAQ -49.36 SP500 -30.41 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 2288/397/1.59 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 2863/224/1.15 bln 2:35 pm : The major indices continue to trend lower amid broad-based selling pressure.

Losses are deep and broad-based. The upside to the losses, however, is that stocks are looking oversold, as they were ahead of the prior session's rally. Given that the general direction of trade continues to move lower, it will likely take an encouraging headline to drive short sellers to cover their positions. Since the short trade has become such a crowded position, market pundits believe that a short squeeze could turn into a strong rally, especially if the move attracts money from the sidelines. DJ30 -234.88 NASDAQ -14.59 SP500 -25.98 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 2207/410/1.30 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 2817/249/955 mln 1:30 pm : The Dow is now down 24% year-to-date, while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen slightly less since the start of the year. The Nasdaq is down almost 17% for the year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 400 Mid-cap Index and Russell 2000 Small-cap Index are showing year-to-date losses of 23% and 29%, respectively. Worse yet, the Dow Jones Transportation Index is down 36% for the year, and the Amex Airline Index is down 47%. DJ30 -209.56 NASDAQ -36.21 SP500 -23.69 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 2117/465/1.18 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 2772/272/871 mln 1:05 pm : A weak close in the prior session opened the door for sellers to regain control over stocks. The stock market has since reversed the prior session's rally, touching fresh multiyear lows in the process. Weakness was further fueled by news that Moody's is reviewing the credit ratings of Bank of America (BAC 3.28, -0.32) and Wells Fargo (WFC 8.05, -1.61), while JPMorgan Chase (JPM 17.26, -2.04) had its outlook lowered. Meanwhile, Dow component Citigroup (C 1.05, -0.08) took out all-time lows when it slipped below $1.00 per share, according to reports. The financial services giant continues to be hampered by fears regarding its ability to survive on its own. Fellow Dow component General Motors (GM 1.81, -0.39) has been beaten down after auditors rekindled the threat of bankruptcy in the troubled automaker by calling out GM's recurring losses and inability to generate cash flow. The report wasn't totally surprising, though, since the auditor's items of concern were among the primary reasons driving the company to borrow billions from the government. Wal-Mart (WMT 49.81, +1.32) reported positive same-store sales results for February and increased its dividend. Still, many other retailers continue to suffer from weaker consumer spending, which stems from a loss of household wealth and rising unemployment. Weekly jobless claims were down more than expected from the prior week, but remain at elevated levels. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 28 totaled 639,000. Continuing claims totaled 5.106 million. The consensus was pegged at 5.155 million. The prior reading showed 5.12 million continuing claims. In other economic news, nonfarm productivity in the fourth quarter declined 0.4%, though it was expected to increase 1.2% after the prior reading showed a 3.2% increase. Unit labor costs in the fourth quarter climbed to a 5.7% gain from the prior reading's 1.8% increase. Economists expected a 3.8% increase.DJ30 -228.99 NASDAQ -41.87 SP500 -26.57 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 2125/430/1.08 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 2799/240/793 mln 12:30 pm : Given the persistence of such stiff headwinds as higher unemployment, depreciated home values and asset portfolios, and tenuous economic conditions, consumers continue to keep their purses clasped. In turn, Gap (GPS 10.17, -0.49), Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF 17.51, -3.42), American Eagle (AEO 9.70, -0.24), Macy's (M 6.55, -0.80), Nordstrom (JWN 12.27, -1.32), JCPenney (JCP 14.45, -0.89), Kohl's (KSS 35.62, -0.19), and Target (TGT 26.39, -0.77) all reported lower same-store sales results for February. At the other end of things, Aeropostale (ARO 23.15, +0.04), Wal-Mart (WMT 49.89, +1.40), and Family Dollar (FDO 30.50, +3.23) all reported positive same-store sales for February. Wal-Mart and Family Dollar went one step further; Wal-Mart increased its annual dividend to $1.09 per share from $0.95 per share, while Family Dollar provided upbeat guidance.DJ30 -198.56 NASDAQ -37.42 SP500 -23.83 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 2088/439/973 mln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 2797/233/716 mln 12:00 pm : Stoc...
