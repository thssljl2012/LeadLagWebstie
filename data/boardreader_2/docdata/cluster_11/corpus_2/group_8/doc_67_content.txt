Pfizer launches $13.5 bln debt sale in 5 parts-IFR Tue Mar 17, 2009 1:12pm EDT NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's largest drugmaker, launched a $13.5 billion debt sale in five parts on Tuesday, said IFR. The bond sale has garnered about $27 billion in interest, buy-side sources said, with about 1,700 orders placed, one trader said. If the size of Pfizer's bond sale remains where it was launched, it will be the second-largest U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bond ever priced, behind Roche's Holding Ltd's (ROG.VX) $16 billion deal sold last month. Some investors believe the success of Roche's deal paved the way for Pfizer to sell such a large bond offering. "I think after the Roche deal came, everybody knew that it could be something in this ($13.5 billion) context," one trader looking at the Pfizer deal said. Since pricing in mid-February, all the tranches in Roche's six-part sale have rallied. Among the fixed-rate tranches, Roche's new three-year bonds have rallied to 215 basis points over comparable Treasuries, while its new five-year tranche have firmed to 283 basis points, a trader said. Both tranches priced at 335 basis points over Treasuries. Meanwhile, Roche's new 10-year tranche has rallied to 308 basis points over Treasuries after pricing at 345 basis points and its 30-year tranche has rallied to 320 basis points after pricing at 365 basis points over Treasuries, said the trader. Pfizer's debt sale is expected to consist of $1.25 billion two-year floating rate notes priced at 195 basis points over the three-month London international bank offered rate, said IFR, a Thomson Reuters service. It is also expected to include $3.5 billion three-year fixed-rate notes yielding 305 basis points more than comparable U.S. Treasuries, $3 billion six-year notes yielding 340 basis points over Treasuries, $3.25 billion 10-year notes yielding 325 basis points over Treasuries and $2.5 billion 30-year bonds yielding 345 basis points over Treasuries. Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the joint lead managers of the deal. Pfizer is raising money to help fund its purchase of Wyeth (WYE.N). Investors have eagerly bought over $158 billion of new U.S. corporate bonds this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, as many see corporate bonds as the most attractive alternative to safer but lower yielding U.S. government debt.
