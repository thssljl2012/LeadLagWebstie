Dow below 7,000 Blue-chip measure drops to levels not seen since 1997 as AIG reports biggest quarterly loss in corporate history, government revamps rescue. NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Stocks tumbled Monday, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 falling to 12-year lows after insurance company American International Group's huge quarterly loss added to worries about the financial sector and the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) lost almost 300 points, or 4.2% to end at 6763.29, its lowest point since April 25, 1997. The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) index lost 34 points, or 4.7%, ending at 700.82, its lowest close since Oct. 28, 1996. The Nasdaq composite (COMP) lost 55 points, or 4% to end at 1322.85. The tech-fueled Nasdaq has held up better than the other major averages this year and remains above its close of 1316.12 from Nov. 20, 2008. The stock losses Monday were in response to AIG, but also a continuation of the worries about the financial sector and the economy, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services. "There are reverberations from AIG and also the continued uncertainty around the financial sector as a whole, which is the chorus that never ends," he said. "That's paired with the second chorus that never ends - the weakness of the global economy," he said. "It's reflected in the weakness in the industrial, material and energy stocks today." Investors also remain wary about the various government initiatives to try to stem the recession, announced over the last few weeks, said Mark Travis, president and CEO at Intrepid Capital Funds. They include the newest bank bailout plan, the $787 billion economic stimulus plan and the $75 billion mortgage modification plan. "The administration is hemming and hawing and still not being clear about exactly what they are going to do and how it's going to work," he said. Travis said that some of the policies are "well meaning but aren't going to provide the elixir that they hope." With all the uncertainty, investors are on a "capital strike."
