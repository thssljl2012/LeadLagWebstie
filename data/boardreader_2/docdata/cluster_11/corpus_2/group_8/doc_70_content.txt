"This is perhaps the first win/win/win policy to be put on the table and it should be welcomed enthusiastically," Gross, the co-chief investment officer of Pimco told Reuters. "We intend to participate and do our part to serve clients as well as promote economic recovery," he added.

The move ignited a rally in financial stocks overseas that spread to U.S. markets this morning.
