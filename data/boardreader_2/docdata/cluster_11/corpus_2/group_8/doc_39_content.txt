   Heavy losses at insurer Aviva today sparked a wave of selling across the insurance sector that dragged the FTSE 100 down more than 3%, driving shares close to a new six-year low.    Investors took fright after the owner of Norwich Union recorded a loss before tax of 1.3bn last year fuelling fears that the insurance industry was poised to become the next victim of the financial crisis    The company's shares dived by a third to 189p, while Prudential also tumbled by 18%, Friends Provident lost 15% and Legal &amp; General fell 14%.    The loss of confidence was matched on Wall Street where stocks plunged to their lowest level for more than 11 years. By lunchtime in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 228 points to 6,647, its worst point since April 1997.    Banking stocks plummeted after the credit agency Moody's said it was considering cutting its ratings on JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America.    Among the worst hit was Citigroup, which saw its shares fall 13% to 97 cents at one point, dropping under $1 for the first time. Until recently, stocks priced at less than a dollar were ejected from the New York Stock Exchange, although the Big Board has relaxed this rule in the light of market turmoil.    Citigroup, which has received $45bn of emergency government aid, could face the humiliation of losing its position in the blue-chip Dow Jones index. A Dow Jones spokesman said the index's inclusion committee was "watching the situation closely".    Market analysts said US stocks were depressed by warnings from General Motors' auditor of substantial doubt over the carmaker's viability. On the economic front, there was disappointment on global markets over indications from Beijing that the Chinese government will not raise its economic stimulus package.    Andrew Moss, Aviva's chief executive, said the company was in good shape to weather the downturn with operating profits up 4% to 2.3bn. He insisted that its capital position remained robust and its balance sheet was able to cope with a long and deep recession without any need for extra capital.    He dismissed suggestions that a 500m dividend payment would eat into the much needed capital. He also countered suggestions that a deterioration in world markets since the company's December year end had also made the situation worse.    He said: "In a tumultuous year, our underlying business has shown great resilience. Operating profits are up and we have maintained our dividend. Bottom line earnings have been affected by investment markets which have predictably created significant unrealised losses during the year.    "Aviva remains financially strong. We've undertaken a thorough review of the value of our assets and liabilities, and have made cautious provision for future losses so that we are in good shape to withstand the ongoing volatility and uncertainty in world markets. Maintaining our capital strength has been a priority for us and remains so this year.      Many investors focused their attention on 2.9bn of unrealised losses in the US that would wipe out any capital surplus.    Broker Bernstein said the picture was unduly negative. "The math is seductive, as the post-tax cost of the unrealised losses will roughly match the surplus. The issue is, will those losses be realised and when. Full loss realisation implies that around 30% of investment grade companies go bust in the next five years  an absurd prospect, or at least one that it is not in the general market prices."    Bernstein also dismissed fears that the company has failed to provide reserves for the commercial properties it owns in the UK which have plummeted in value. "The portfolio has an average loan to value of 103% after a 37% price fall in prices."    Analysts at the stockbroker Killik &amp; Co were more sceptical: "Aviva's exposure to corporate bonds remains a big worry, with today's moves in the high yield bond spreads indicative of the mood of the market. In today's statement, Aviva wrote down the value of its bond holdings by 8% and increased default provisions for its corporate bond holdings by 300m and commercial mortgage investments by 250m to create a buffer against future losses. Clearly, the market feels this trend has a lot further to run. Given the lack of visibility over the outlook for the group's business, an investment in Aviva remains very high risk."
