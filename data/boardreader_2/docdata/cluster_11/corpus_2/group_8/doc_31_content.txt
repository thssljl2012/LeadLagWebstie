   Stocks fell at the open Thursday, with technology leading the slide, as economic pressures acted as a drag on Wall Street.        Cisco   got the market started on a bad note, while bank stocks, particularly  JPMorgan Chase  plunged as Washington leaders debated over to how to fix the financial sector.  Dell  shares also tumbled following a downgrade from JPMorgan.      Initial jobless claims    jumped by 35,000    to 626,000 last week, the highest since October 1982 and much higher than economists had expected. Meanwhile, productivity jumped 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, more than three times the 0.9-percent increase expected.      This comes a day ahead of the January employment report; economists expect that half a million jobs more were shaved from nonfarm payrolls.      Slightly better news came from the housing sector, where  a bottom for the housing market in the US is in sight  and likely in the fourth quarter, according to a report by Moody's Economy.com.       Cisco  reported a profit and revenue that beat Wall Street forecasts, but said it expects year-over-year sales to fall in the current quarter, sending shares lower.       State Street  also was casting another dark cloud over the banking industry, as the world's largest institutional money manager slashed its dividend and cut its outlook on worse than expected losses in commercial paper and investments. But shares gained as investors focused on statements from the company that the changes would help steady the bank's financial picture.       Meanwhile, Bank of America  led S&amp;P 500 losers as the bank's shares continued in freefall, following a Wall Street Journal report that indicated the government pressured BofA CEO Ken Lewis into taking on Merrill Lynch against his wishes.       Asian markets ended mixed, while European stocks were lower, with investors gloomy after more bad results in the banking sector.        Billionaire investor Warren Buffett   is investing 3 billion Swiss francs ($2.63 billion) in Swiss Re  , just as the world's second-largest reinsurer wrote down 6 billion Swiss francs ($5.25 billion) in toxic assets, the company said.        Wall Street also was closely watching retail sales numbers.        Wal-Mart  shares gained after the world's largest retailer said its sales in January grew 2.1 percent, a full percentage point ahead of expectations. The company led a small field of Dow 30 gainers.       In other earnings, GlaxoSmithKline  drew mixed reaction from Wall Street after its earnings beat expectations, but drew some concern when the company said it was changing the way it issues guidance. Shares initially dropped 3.2 percent premarket but then turned flat.     Pulte Homes  said after the bell Wednesday that it narrowed its quarterly loss, and sales at the homebuilding company rose from the same period last year.       Visa,  the world's largest credit card network, posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings after the bell Wednesday, as consumers used their cards more and boosted revenue.        The Bank of England continued its race to the bottom and cut by another half a percentage point to 1 percent Thursday despite a falling pound and the risk of inflation. But the European Central Bank, the most reluctant among major central banks to lower rates, stood pat.        Auto parts suppliers, hard hit by the downturn among car makers, are asking for up to $20.5 billion in federal aid to survive the worst industry downturn in decades, the Automotive News reported on Wednesday.                       cnbc_comboQuoteMove('popup_GSK_ID0EXOAE15839609');    cnbc_comboQuoteMove('popup_DELL_ID0ERH15839609');
