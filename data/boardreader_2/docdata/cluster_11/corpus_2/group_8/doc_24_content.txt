 Shares of paper products companies fell Friday after a report showed that demand for their products plunged last month in what could mark the beginning of another tough year for the industry.      Preliminary data from the American Forest &amp; Paper Association showed a decline of 25.3 percent in January 2009 from a year ago. That follows declines of 20.7 percent in December and 20.2 percent in November from the year-earlier months.      "This is by far the worst 3-month stretch that we can remember. No other period even comes close," Deutsche Bank-North America analyst Mark Wilde said in a client note.      Wilde said he expects "the massive amount of market downtime" that the industry gook in the fourth quarter will have to continue.      "Ultimately, we will need to see more permanent (or at least indefinite) capacity closures," he wrote.      Barclay's Capital analyst Peter Ruschmeier said the collapsing demand threatens printing paper companies' credit. He specifically cited International Paper Co., AbitibiBowater Inc. and Sappi Ltd.      Last month Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., a major producer of cardboard materials, filed for bankruptcy.      In afternoon trading, International Paper fell 31 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $6.98, Sappi declined 37 cents, or 11.9 percent, to $2.75, and Domtar Corp. lost 5 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $1.09.
