Hope everyone had a nice weekend          http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqmwr4trlpc          Monday is very simple: at 10 a.m. New York time we have existing home sales coming out of the U.S. There is nothing else happening. Here is the situation: existing home sales accounts for 85% of all home sales, and from February the number has been dropping, and it is expected to drop again this month. It is expected to come out at 5.7 million versus 5.75 million last month. If for some reason the existing home sales come out at 6 million or higher, I think that could be strengthening for the U.S. dollar, especially after the new home sales came out better, and after Bank of America merged with one of the big real estate company. I think a reading of 6 million or higher may possibly send GBP/USD down by 40 pips or more in the first hour of the report because it would be pretty much the highest reading in the last three months. If, on the other hand, it reads 5.5 million or lower, I think it wouldn't be too good for the U.S. because housing declined a lot more than it was expected, and I think GBP/USD may possibly gain 40 pips or more in the first hour of the report. This indicator may even cause a move of 70-80 pips in the first hour of the report as housing is important right now. It will all depends on deviation and where the price is before the report.
