 In this market, everything is so depressed that  something  is bound to come roaring back. It probably won't be financials (at least not the ones you are likely to know like C and BAC), but if you invest in an ETF that focuses on financials, that would probably be a very solid long-term investment  if  AIG doesn't finally crumple under the weight of its derivatives portfolio. The dividend return is historically strong in this sector as well, so if you get in at a low share price you'll be very happy in 20 years' time.     That AIG thing is an issue though. The severe consequences that would have are weighing heavily on the market; if AIG fails, it'll be catastrophic, and that looming spectre is a big part in the dire state of the entire stock market. If AIG starts defaulting on all the financial insurance contracts it has, it's going to be horribly destructive. So do you keep this scenario in mind and sit on the sidelines, or jump in knowing that sooner or later, the government's persistence in propping up AIG will stabilize the company and the storm will pass? It's a tough call for anyone to make, much less at 19. But it's an important decision to make which will have a big impact on your portfolio, no matter what sector of the market you invest in.     Or you can take the safe route and invest in money market funds, I suppose. There will be deflationary pressures on the currency market at least for a little while longer, so capital preservation would be good. But this is usually what you do when you already have enough money for the rest of your life and just don't want to lose it.
