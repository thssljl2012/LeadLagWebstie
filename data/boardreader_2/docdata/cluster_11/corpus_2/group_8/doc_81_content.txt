See how Dow jumped today just because Citibank had good news. Just shows all the bad news yet one piece of good news and people change. They start buying. All our markets down is very much about emotional trading these days. But in the long run good fundamentals will win out. It was good to see that bank made money for all of us. We need to see Citibank do well to help our economy.
