An armed robber who held up a bank on Auckland's North Shore today may have robbed two other banks in the last few weeks.  The man used a hand gun to rob the Browns Bay branch of the Westpac Bank at 11am today and escape with cash.  Staff were shaken but no one was hurt.  Police said the man may also have robbed the Onehunga branch of the Westpac Bank on January 7 and the Orewa branch of the ASB Bank on February 2.  Police said if the same man held up all three banks, they had concerns he may hurt someone if he tried to rob more banks. They appealed for the public's help to identify him. The man was Caucasian with olive skin, in his 40s or 50s and about 178cm tall. He wore a black baseball cap over a white t-shirt or cloth wrapped around his head, sunglasses, a dark long sleeve top, dark blue jeans and bare feet. - NZPA
