Camden County Prosecutor Warren W. Faulk, Haddonfield Police Chief Rick Tsonis and Haddon Township Police Chief Mark Cavallo reported Tuesday a search for a man who robbed two banks this month, including one he robbed this morning.  The suspect struck Haddon Township's Bank of America on West Crystal Lake Avenue at 3 p.m. on February 6, 2009. It is believed the same person robbed Haddonfield's The Bank on Kings Highway West at 9 a.m. today, February 17, 2009.  In both incidents, the man approached a teller, handed the teller a note written on an envelope demanding money, and fled with an undisclosed sum.  The suspect is a white man in his 50s or 60s, with light hair and unkempt, white facial hair. The man stands about six feet tall and was of thin to medium build. In both incidents he wore a baseball cap and a dark jacket. In Haddon Township he was seen wearing sunglasses. In Haddonfield he was seen wearing prescription glasses.  Surveillance photos of the suspect from this morning's robbery are included with this press release. It would be most appreciated if your publication or broadcast could make time and space to disseminate these photographs.  Anyone with information on these robberies is urged to contact Camden County Prosecutor's Office Investigator Bill Townsend at (856) 225-8400 or Haddonfield Detective Jose Ortiz at (856) 429-4700.
