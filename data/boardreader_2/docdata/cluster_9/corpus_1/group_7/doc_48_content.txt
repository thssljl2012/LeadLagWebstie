  BUENA VISTA TOWNSHIP - Christian Brothers Academy and St. Augustine Prep have some really fast swimmers.   The Prep just has more of them.  And it was the top-seeded Hermits' depth that carried them to a 91-79 victory over second-seeded CBA on Tuesday at Navone Pool in the South Jersey Non-Public A final. St. Augustine, which earned its sixth straight sectional title, advances to meet Seton Hall Prep in the Non-Public A final on Sunday at 12:15 p.m. at The College of New Jersey in Ewing Township. 'It's an awesome feeling to come out on top,' Prep junior Steve Melchiorre said.  Melchiorre had a standout day for the Hermits (12-1), No. 1 in The Press' Elite 11, as the team's lone double-winner. He captured the 200-yard freestyle in 1 minute, 46.08 seconds and the 100 backstroke in 55.11.  As good as Melchiorre's performances were, though, the key to Prep's triumph was more about what   happened after the winners touched the wall. The Hermits won just two other events - Steve Gibson in the 50 freestyle (21.97) and Ian Keyser in the 500 freestyle (4:55.78) -but they dominated in second- and third-place finishes.  Prep combined for 16 seconds and thirds, while the Colts (8-2) managed just six. That's a difference of 35 team points. 'You can get first, but if you don't get two, three and fours you need those to win the meet,' Prep's Rob Mele said.  Mele epitomized the Hermits' advantage, garnering a third in the 100 butterfly to go with seconds in the 200 freestyle, 200 freestyle relay and 400 freestyle relay. His runner-up finish in the 200 freestyle was part of a 1-2-3 Prep sweep in the meet's second event that set the tone for the day while giving the Hermits a 19-8 lead they wouldn't relinquish. 'I'm very pleased and they should be really happy,' Prep coach Jon Stinson said of his swimmers. 'They came in ready to go and all did best times. The depth helps us.' It's one thing to have depth, but another altogether to have good depth. The Hermits have the latter. And, for that, Stinson credits the team's training regimen. 'They compete against each other in practice, train together, so of course they're going to get better,' he said. Said Melchiorre: 'I think it's the work ethic because we always work hard and have tough practices.' Melchiorre watched from the pool deck as CBA opened the meet by taking the 200 medley relay, with the Prep staying within 8-6 thanks to a second and third. Colts coach Vito Chiaravalloti then elected to keep one of his best swimmers, Alex Fitton, out of the next race to save him for the 200 IM.   While Fitton came through, claiming the 200 IM - one of four events he won - the move worked more in Prep's favor because Melchiorre, Mele and Brett Pederson swept the 200 freestyle to give the Hermits and their large home contingent the momentum they needed.  From that point, CBA kept winning and Prep kept scoring with the Hermits clinching victory in the penultimate event, the 100 breaststroke, with fittingly a third (Pederson; 1:04.77), fourth (Aaron Kaminski; 1:05.54) and fifth (Dan Choyce; 1:05.7). 'They're a great team and they're going to go on and win a state championship,' Chiaravalloti said.  Melchiorre knows that a 'great team' is what allowed the Hermits to come out on top Tuesday. It's also why he was reluctant to pick out one of his teammates who raised his level the most. 'I was impressed with everyone,' Melchiore said. 'Everyone swam a lifetime best, or right around it.' 200 Medley Relay-CBA (Marc Freda, Connor McColligan, Joe Connors, Will Johnson) 1:41.81; 200 Freestyle-Steve Melchiorre SA 1:46.08; 200 IM-Alex Fitton CBA 1:58.18; 50 Freestyle-Steve Gibson SA 21.97; 100 Butterfly-Harrison Cefalo CBA 52.16; 100 Freestyle-Alex Fitton 48.07; 500 Freestyle-Ian Keyser SA 4:55.78; 200 Freestyle Relay-CBA (Charlie Pataffi, Harrison Cefalo, Will Johnson, Alex Fitton) 1:28.82; 100 Backstroke-Steve Melchiorre SA 55.11; 100 Breaststroke-Connor McColligan CBA 1:02.91; 400 Freestyle Relay-CBA (Harrison Cefalo, Sean Dunne, Charlie Pataffi, Alex Fitton) 3:18.43.
