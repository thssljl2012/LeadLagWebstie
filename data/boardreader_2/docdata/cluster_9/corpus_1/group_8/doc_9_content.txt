The FBI and Denver police are looking for a repeat offender, in more ways than one.   The same robber hit the same bank twice in three weeks, including two downtown banks today.   Surveillance cameras show the same man in his 20s robbing the US Bank at 950 17th St. this morning, the same bank the same man robbed on Feb. 27, police said.   The same suspect robbed Chase Bank at 1125 17th St. today, as well, according to investigators.   He was wearing a baseball cap, cocked to one side, in all three robberies.   He was further described as white, between five feet, six inches tall and five feet, 10 inches tall with a slim build.   Anyone with information can call the FBI Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force at 303-629-7171, or remain anonymous and possibly qualify for a $2,000 reward by calling Crime Stoppers at 720-913-7867.
