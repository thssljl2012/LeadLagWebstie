Two bank employees and a customer chased down, tackled and subdued a man who allegedly robbed a Bethesda bank on Friday, according to police.  Lawrence Patrick Gilmartin, 43, of Washington, D.C., entered the Bank of America on Wisconsin Avenue at about 4 p.m., demanded cash, and then fled the bank with an undisclosed amount of money, according to Montgomery County Police Spokeswoman Megan Duffey. After he left the bank, two adult male bank employees and an adult male customer chased after Gilmartin, eventually tackling him in front of the Gifford's ice cream store at the corner of Woodmont and Bethesda avenues, where they held him until police arrived minutes later.  In the course of the chase, Gilmartin sprayed pepper spray twice at his chasers, but they did not yield, Duffy said.  Duffy commended the actions of good Samaritans, but warned against other possible do-gooders. 'We always make it clear that people are putting themselves in danger [when they chase after a criminal],' Duffy said. 'You never know what type of weapon that person might have.' After police arrived at the scene, Gilmartin was taken to an area hospital, complaining that he injured his hand, Duffy said.  At the hospital police charged him with two counts of armed robbery; the second charge stems from a robbery at the same Bank of America branch on Feb. 13.  The money from Friday's robbery was returned to the bank. 'I always tell people if they can get a really great description of the person, or the tag number, make and model of a car, that's fine,' Duffy said. 'They should try and get as much information as possible without getting themselves into the situation.' According to court records, Gilmartin has been charged with more than a dozen crimes in Maryland in the past 17 years, ranging from possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute and theft, to battery and forgery.
