A bank-robbery suspect arrested Saturday in Colorado Springs allegedly had help from a leading figure within the US Bank's branch, according to police.   After arresting Michael Martinez, 48 , Saturday afternoon, Colorado Springs police also arrested Evelyn Solano, 48, the branch manager of the US Bank at 3505 Austin Bluffs Parkway.   According to police, a 'thorough investigation' revealed that Solano helped plan the heist but didn't participate in the actual robbery. Solano was at work when the robbery took place.   Authorities said Solano and Martinez might be romantically involved. Both suspects are in custody as police continue to investigate the incident. The money stolen an undisclosed amount was found in Martinez's car, police said.   Witnesses reported to police that Martinez gave a note to a teller, not Solano, saying he intended to rob the bank. Martinez allegedly indicated he had a gun, but police didn't recover any weapons when Martinez was arrested near the bank.   The Colorado Springs Gazette reported that witnesses saw Martinez 'dressed in black, with glasses and a fake beard.' It was the city's first bank robbery this year.
