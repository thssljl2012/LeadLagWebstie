Montgomery County police say a bank robber didn't make it far after a group of people tackled him about two blocks away.  Police say 43-year-old Lawrence Gilmartin of northeast D.C. demanded money at the Bank of America on Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda Friday afternoon.  After fleeing with an undisclosed amount of money, two bank employees and a customer chased after him. Gilmartin allegedly used pepper spray twice on the men pursuing him.  The group of men tackled the suspect and held him down until police arrived.  Police have obtained a warrant for Gilmartin, charging him with two counts of armed bank robbery. Police say he also robbed the same bank last month.  Though police commended those who chased him, officials say people should not put themselves at risk.
