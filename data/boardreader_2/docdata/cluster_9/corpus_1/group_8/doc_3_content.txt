WEST PALM BEACH A Bank of America's front doors were locked after a robbery this afternoon.  The branch at U.S. 1 and Summa Street just south of Forest Hill Boulevard was robbed earlier today, according to police officials. No details of the robbery were immediately available.  As of 3 p.m. police had already left the scene and the only sign of the robbery was a bit of yellow police tape hanging from a stop sign. The lobby doors of the bank remained locked with a sign apologizing for the inconvenience. A teller inside declined to open the door or comment. Customers were still being served through the drive through.
