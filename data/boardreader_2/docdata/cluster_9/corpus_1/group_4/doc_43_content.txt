And I'm not sure, even though there are clauses in the CBA that allow some medical disclosures, that they could or even maybe would say he didn't and damage his chances to go elsewhere.  I just think it's really unusual to bring a guy in for a physical before they have come to terms.  All that and six minutes from now they announce it's a done deal.  _________________  Last edited by BGCARDFAN on 21 Nov 2008 16:19 pm; edited 1 time in total  rbc1  Forum User  Joined: 09 Jul 2006  Posts: 1181  Post subject: Re: Anyone think Miller didn't pass the physical?
