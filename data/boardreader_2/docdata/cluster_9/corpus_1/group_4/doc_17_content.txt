When three people with a combined wealth of 4.5billion meet for dinner at an exclusive restaurant, you might expect them to push the boat out.  But for X Factor creator Simon Cowell, retail tycoon Sir Philip Green and new City golden girl Amanda Staveley, a simple meal of fish, chips and mushy peas was enough.  More interesting than what was on their plates at Scotts seafood restaurant in Mayfair, however, was what the powerful trio might have been discussing.  Maybe they were cooking up an exciting new business deal. Perhaps Sir Philip was regaling them with tales of his recent intervention in   the Icelandic banking crisis. Did Miss Staveley  a 6ft former model and ex-girlfriend of Prince Andrew  tell them about the series of successful deals she has negotiated on behalf of wealthy Arab clients?  One suggestion that Sir Philip was quick to laugh off last night was that he had been playing Cupid for 35-year-old Miss Staveley and the newly single Cowell, 49.   The two, who had never met before but were said to have got on well, would appear to be a good match, at least financially, with both of them said to be worth about 100million.  Cowell has made his fortune from record deals and the money-spinning shows The X Factor, Pop Idol, American Idol and Britains Got Talent. Miss Staveley, who travels the world by private jet and limousine, recently came into the public eye with deals involving Manchester City Football Club and Barclays Bank, which are said to have earned her 50million in commission.  Sir Philip, the 56-year-old owner of Bhs and Topshop who, with his wife Tina is worth 4.3billion, has known Miss Staveley for 12 years.  He said he had already arranged to dine out with her when he decided to invite his close friend Cowell to join them.  and was said to be at a loose end when Sir Philip called him last Tuesday.  Last night, all three firmly denied there had been a business element to their dinner, and Sir Philip dismissed any suggestion that he had been acting as matchmaker.  Speaking from his home in Monaco, he said: Ive known Amanda for a long time and she has been a friend of mine way before she left London to live mainly in the Middle East. I had invited Amanda for dinner and as Simon was at a loose end, I called and asked if he would like to join us. We had fish, chips and mushy peas, washed down with a couple of bottles of Chablis. But theres a credit crunch on. Thats why we all went Dutch, and we paid for our own meals. Simon had never met Amanda before and it was a purely social occasion. After dinner, I walked her up the street to her London home and Simon went off in a car on his own. Theres nothing else going on.  Cowells spokesman Max Clifford said: Philip was there with Amanda and Simon joined them, then left. Theres nothing going on. A spokesman for Miss Staveley said: Amanda had a pleasant evening, then went home. Though the meal the three shared sounds modest, the bill would stretch most families struggling to cope with the recession. It came to an estimated 226.96, including service.   It was made up of deep-fried haddock at 17.50 a head plus three side orders of chips (3.75 each), giving a total food bill of 63.75.  Then there were two 59 bottles of Chablis Premier Cru Fourchaume Guy Mothe et Fils, Domaine du Colombier 2007, table waters at 8 and coffees for 12.  Cowell, a career smoker, went to a table outside to smoke, dangling his cigarette Andy Capp-style.  For her part, Miss Staveley has told The  that she may help broker more deals to bail out English Premier League football clubs for her Arab clients.  They include Abu Dhabis Sheik Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, with whom she put together the 210million purchase of Manchester City, and the 7billion Barclays deal.  Of the new clubs said to be targets of Miss Staveleys Arab connections, Everton and West Ham head the list, followed by Newcastle United, Portsmouth and possibly Liverpool.
