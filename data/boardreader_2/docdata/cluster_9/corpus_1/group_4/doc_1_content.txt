Police are seeking four men who stole a car and then went on a robbery spree in south Auckland yesterday afternoon.  The robbers stole a grey Nissan Primera from Hunters Plaza, Papatoetoe about 1.35pm before robbing four places in 30 minutes from 4.30pm.  Detective Senior Sergeant Dave Pizzini said the first robbery came outside the ASB Bank in Botany Junction, when one of the men attempted to grab keys and money bags from a woman of Indian descent.  Mr Pizzini said the man verbally threatened the woman with a gun before fleeing to the Nissan empty-handed.  Shortly afterwards, an offender entered a restaurant in Thomas Rd, Flatbush, about 3km away, threatening staff with a hand gun with a long silver barrel and a brown handle. He left with a small amount of cash and was seen getting into the same vehicle.  At 4.50pm the robbers got to Davies Ave in Manukau City, where a 24-year-old woman of Pacific Island descent had her handbag grabbed after being threatened with a gun. The offender was seen to arrive and exit in the grey Nissan.  Ten minutes later, a 35-year-old Indian woman walking down an alley in Fitzroy St, Papatoetoe had a man get out of the Nissan and push a gun into her chest. Her bag was grabbed and the man ran back to the car.  Mr Pizzini said the stolen car was found at Winton Place, Otara about 7.15pm.  Anyone with information is asked to call Otara Police on (09) 272 0900.
