Carbondale Police arrested a Chicago area rapper wanted for a 2007 Chicago-area bank robbery, officials from the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday.  Terrance Boykin, who is also known as 'Bump J' was arrested earlier this week by Carbondale police during a traffic stop, officials said.  Boykin has been the subject of a nationwide manhunt since September, when he was charged with bank robbery and firearms violations in relation to the Jan. 4, 2007, robbery of a Chase Bank branch in Oak Park, according to a news release from the Department of Justice.  'According to witnesses, two men, both armed with handguns entered the bank and announced a robbery,' the release said. 'They then forced bank employees to give them cash from the teller drawers and the bank vault, escaping on foot with over $100,000.'  The incident was recorded by bank surveillance cameras.
