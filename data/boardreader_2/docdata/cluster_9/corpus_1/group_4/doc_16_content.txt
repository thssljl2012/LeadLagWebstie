IVE never really understood why, at this time of year, people spend so much money on little cardboard tubes full of gunpowder, set light to them, then stand back and watch them fizzle brightly for a full 10 seconds.  Im not knocking fireworks  a big, organised and well co-ordinated display can look fantastic.  The bit I dont get is why people would want to bring these dangerous explosives into their homes and then systematically start blowing up bits of their garden. Or worse, each other.  Obviously its all part of the tradition. The 5th of November was when Guy Fawkes was caught beneath the parliament building with enough gunpowder to launch it to the moon.  The history books dont seem to mention if the cache included catherine wheels, roman candles or rockets launched from milk bottles.  Last week, West FM and West Sound held the Cash For Kids Monster Mash, it was a great success and we are still counting all the money raised throughout Ayrshire.  Loads of local businesses joined in on the fun, a special mention has to go to the Job Centre Plus in Ayr, who won our very special Halloween Hamper. They had some great costumes and raised over 100 for Cash For Kids.  We also have to say thank you to Barclays Bank who launched their Cash For Kids appeal by promising to match pound for pound all money raised by their employees.  We have some great pictures of the West Sound and West FM team  and our listeners  fully done up in their Halloween gear on the website, see westfm.co.uk for more details.  If you think you have what it takes to be part of the West FM team, then why not join our Street Team. Were looking for volunteers to join us for PR at Events and Roadshows throughout Ayrshire. You need to be enthusiastic, confident, love entertaining and have a passion for all things radio. If this sounds like you send your CV and a resent pic to streetteam@westfm.co.uk  Ill talk to you on the Breakfast Show, Monday to Friday from 6am on 96.7 West FM
