WEST DERBY Taekwondo star Jessica OHanlon insists her selection for the Lloyds TSB Local Heroes scheme is already enhancing her dream of emulating Olympic bronze medalist Sarah Stevenson at London 2012.The 18-year-old Wirral Olympic Taekwondo Centre member is one of 250 emerging Brits that will receive 1,000 each year in the run up to London 2012 - plugging a financial gap as OHanlon (pictured) is yet to achieve World Class lottery funding.OHanlon will also benefit from the know how of local hero mentors including former Olympic triple-jump champion Jonathan Edwards, while she has already put the cash to good use, financing her hefty travel costs.And after watching Stevenson claim bronze in Beijing as Team GB finished fourth on the medal table with 19 golds, the former Liverpool Community College pupil is already aiming to follow in Stevensons footsteps.The money has been really useful for buying equipment but Im trying to keep most of it for travelling. Going up to the seniors this year means there are far more national competitions, said OHanlon.The National Championships in September will be my first senior national event and Im going for gold in that one definitely.Looking further ahead I would love to be part of the Olympics in 2012, it would be an incredible experience to be a part of that in my own country.Watching Sarah Stevenson winning bronze in a sport that is not all that popular in Great Britain was a real inspiration to me.Lloyds TSB is providing up to 1,000 to 250 emerging young sportspeople identified each year across Britain, in the run up to London 2012 and beyond.
