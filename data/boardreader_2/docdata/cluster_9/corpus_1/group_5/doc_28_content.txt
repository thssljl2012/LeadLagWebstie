And just before the jam, on the evening of the 8th, the Steep Canyon Rangers perform! Those who attended this event last year can attest to the casual atmosphere and spontaneity of the unstructured schedule. The absence of professional performers also means no admission charges for the event.   Saturday evening there will be a band scramble and open mic in the hotel lounge from nine to midnight.   It is hoped that the Bakersfield location will encourage participation by Bluegrassers from Southern California as well as those from 'up North'. Call the hotel at 661-323-7111.   For more information, contact Duane Campbell at dcfiddles@gmail.com or go to the CBA website at cbaontheweb.org.   On the evening before the 48 Hour Jam, Jan. 8, the Kern County Sheriff's Activities League and the Kiwanis of East Bakersfield present A Night of Bluegrass benefit dinner and concert featuring The Steep Canyon Rangers. This event will also be held at the Doubletree Hotel, social hour at 6 p.m., dinner at 7, and the concert at 8. Tickets are $40. For tickets or information, call 661-589-8249 or 661-391-7771.
