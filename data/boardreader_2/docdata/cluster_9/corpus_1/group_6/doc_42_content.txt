New Southern Steel recruit Leah Shoard arrived in Invercargill this week, straight out of a New South Wales heatwave.  And while Southland didn't exactly turn on the weather for her, she admitted it wasn't as cold as she'd expected for now, at least.  Shoard, 22, comes to Steel after a year with ANZ Championship winners the New South Wales Swifts. She's a former member of the Australian under-21 squad, plays mostly goal attack or goal shoot and had two years in the Commonwealth Bank Cup Trophy before playing for the Swifts in the inaugural ANZ Championship.  This year presents a major change for her, not only in terms of the netball, but also in terms of lifestyle. 'At the moment I'm just trying to find my feet,' she said. 'I've literally just moved into this house, I'm just meeting everybody, meeting the coaching staff ... it will be good to have a (training) camp straight away just to meet everyone.' Shoard had been informed of Southland's love of netball and admitted it was set to be a lot different to her home town of Wollongong, where the only place she was really recognised was at the netball courts.  Playing netball in New Zealand, though, had been something she had wanted to do. 'I thought maybe, one day down the track, I'd like to come over to New Zealand and play ... it was in the back of my mind, but I definitely didn't think it would happen this quick,' she said. 'It's a great opportunity and I've heard netball's a lot bigger here it's getting bigger in Australia, but people like Megan Dehn (who played for Steel last year) come back home and tell us all about their experiences ... it will be quite different.' Steel's first training camp to include the full team will start tonight and go through until Sunday.  jerrie.andrews@stl.co.nz
