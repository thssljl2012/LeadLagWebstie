Nationwide Insurance has partnered with racing superstar Dale Earnhardt Jr. and his company JR Motorsports in a campaign that takes its racing sponsorship to a new level. The company is in the second year of a seven-year deal as title sponsor of the NASCAR Nationwide Series of stock car racing (Earnhardt Jr. owns a car that races in that series). The brand will deepen its connection to the sport through a series of TV and radio ads featuring Earnhardt Jr.  Depending on the racetrack, Nationwides activation will include mobile displays, show cars and fan amenity services such as information and transportation. Certain races will feature appearances by Earnhardt Jr. and JR Motorsports driver Brad Keselowski. An interactive microsite, nationwide.com/dalejr, will feature behind-the-scenes videos and photos from a recent ad shoot with Earnhardt Jr.  This is a progression for us, John Aman, associate vp-strategic sponsorships at Nationwide, told Buzz. Last year the NASCAR Nationwide Series got us ingrained in the sport. As we were planning 2009, we knew that the Earnhardt family has been insured by Nationwide for more than 30 years. The consideration was if we were to reach fans more deeply, we felt we should use the most highly regarded active driver in the sport right now. This really becomes a testimonial and hopefully one that resonates with the fan.  The agreement is for one year with an option to renew.
