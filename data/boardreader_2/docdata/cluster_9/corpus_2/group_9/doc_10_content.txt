        QUOTE (CoolPeopleAreWildFans &#064; Apr 22 2009, 11:48 AM)       as much as i think we already have a shroeder player and we have no use for him here, every draft i've ever seen has always ended up proving that you should always draft the best player available regardless of need. schroeder at number 12 would be a steal.     I think at times, its alright to draft for position to fill up a weakness in a prospect pool.  But in our case, we are low in blue-chip prospects everywhere so we have to take the CBA
