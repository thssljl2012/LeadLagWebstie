It is going to be blown up in a year when they renegotiate the CBA.                      eh, the Lions have every reason to blow up the rookie scale this year as they are the ones who are going to be most screwed by it.

He is a VERY similar prospect IMO to Carson Palmer (only Stafford lacks the ideal size)                     I'd rank him below Palmer when he was comming out and probably a little above Cutler.
