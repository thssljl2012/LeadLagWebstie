There's a reason that "you tend to become that which you hate the most" is a cliche.    Unfortunately, as much as the ABA's identity as a league is crossed with Joe Newman's, the PBL's identity appears to start and end in Rochester... and what's left of the CBA passes through Albany.    Someone, somewhere, will start a minor pro basketball league that isn't designed around the ego of one man or one ownership group.  And because we've all been burned, nobody will believe it.      Seriously, the PBL might be able to get out of this - but they're going to have to do something to keep the Rochester-centric perception from becoming an obstacle.  Whether that's an independent commissioner or other changes in the league structure, they ought to do something before this actually does harm the league.
