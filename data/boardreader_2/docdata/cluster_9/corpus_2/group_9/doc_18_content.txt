  quote:  I heard the head of the NFL PLayer's Association, DeMaurice Smith, on the radio this week saying that they aren't interested in controlling how teams pay their players.     As the elected head of the union representing the interests of the players, I really wouldn't expect him to advocate paying anyone  less  money, rookie or veteran.  He's right, this is the owners' fault.  They could decide to pay players less money, they just don't.  They painted themselves into this corner.  I agree that what the first 5-10 picks get paid is ridiculous, I just don't see the NFLPA being behind forcing a change.  Hopefully the owners can push through some changes in the next CBA.
