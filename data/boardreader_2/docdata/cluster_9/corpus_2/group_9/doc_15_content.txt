Just look to history as your guide. Its management/owners vs workers in collective bargaining. 90% of the players in this league have zero bargaining power, they don't have the talent to play anywhere else and there isn't another league that can pay even the pittnace hat these guys make or hint of anyone else looking to form another league to take the place of MLS wit a higher salary structure.      Nothing that can or would benefit the players position will be done until after a new agreement is reached.
