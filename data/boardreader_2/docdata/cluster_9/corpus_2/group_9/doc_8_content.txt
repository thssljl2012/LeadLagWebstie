if what a-1sports proclaim is the plan for the pbl, then how will you ever have any competition? if you are going to let teams in the league, then belittle them for not paying enough for the players, and talk about all that the league does, then shove it in their faces and basicly bully them into last second changes, I just don't see how that is good for the league.       Why would you want the appearance like its a league run by and for rochester? Certainly the league has reached out and paid a lot of money for the owners, in terms of travel and refs, etc.... but does that mean they have all rights to do whatever they think? That seems to be the big question. And if the answer is yes, then just tell people and certainly owners up front.       I said earlier, the usbl had the playoff festival all at one location, pre determined by the league, and it seem to always go well. And having all the playoff games played at rochester might be a great idea in the future. But plan it out.       Finally, The CBA may or may not have folded, but the CBA had many good years. And its success was also in getting many players jobs in the NBA, and six figure jobs overseas. Many coaches as we well know that is in the NBA started in the CBA. So I guess its how you define success!
