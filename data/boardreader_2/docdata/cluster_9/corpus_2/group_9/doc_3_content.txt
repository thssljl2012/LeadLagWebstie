It would be incredibly stupid to sign Stafford for that much money when you can get Curry for 30 million less.         From the latest reports it's looking VERY likely that there will be a rookie cap in the new CBA. Wait til that kicks in (could very well be in effect for next years draft) then draft your QB without having to pay him a pathetic amount of money when QB is such a massive risk.         Again, I have NO PROBLEM with drafting Stafford, I just have a problem with drafting Stafford for that price when Curry, who is easily a safer pick than Stafford is willing to sign for 30 million less.

Assuming this report is true for Stafford's contract on average that is:    Curry-11mill per year/6mill per guaranteed        Stafford-13.3mill per/6.67 per        So as you can see, the difference is not that much really, especially if you consider the paying price for the positions in the NFL. Stafford's contract would be much more in line for a QB than Curry's would be for a LB.             Got to take all the facts into account. It is only an extra 10mill guaranteed with an extra year, and only an extra 2.3 mill per year if (hopefully) they play through their contract. The average per year difference between starting LB's and starting QB's is much greater than that, so if you look a it that way, Stafford is actually the better "deal" _________________      ^^^props to big_palooka^^^    FFMD II Lions AGM
