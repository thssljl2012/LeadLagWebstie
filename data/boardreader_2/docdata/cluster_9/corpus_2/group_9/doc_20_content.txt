What I am not following is this constant babble from  a-1 sports and the pbl office about this league being a new model for minorleague basketball.       Well I have followed the CBA, USBL, IBL, NBDL, IBA, WBA, and the ABA. And I have a pretty good idea as too what they are trying to accomplish. I guess I am not very bright. But after two years and attending many pbl games, following the website, press releases, etc...I can safely say, I have no idea what the master plan is.       But I know that the very faithful and loyal fans of battle creek, who drove in sub zero weather to Chicago on a Cold sunday evening, to support their team, have been screwed and must really be upset.       How could a leagues objective be to piss off hundreds of people? So to make the thousands in Rochester happy? What price has been paid to gain these dollars? If the league needs money that bad, then don't pay for so much extras for the teams.       I submit to you, I am not a college graduate, I am not a Dr. or lawyer, so maybe theres a master plan that is bigger than my little brain can understand. But forgive me, because all I keep thinking about is the loyal battle creek fans that outnumbered the Chicago fans in Chicago, and how much they loved their team. I wonder how those people feel right now about the pbl. And the sad thing, there voice will never be heard.
