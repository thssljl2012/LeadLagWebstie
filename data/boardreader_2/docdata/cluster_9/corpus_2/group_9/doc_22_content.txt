its all about the $$$$$. CBA couldnt do it, ABA doesnt do it, USBL is gone.   Getting TV exposure at a place where there around 5,000 fans is where all the economics is at. You have to stop thinking basketball and start thinking what makes money?  PBL is trying a new business model, so far they are still here in year two...and other leagues are gone. YOU need TV money plain and simple. What other league pays for travel, uniforms and refs and owns a sports TV network ?  I waiting to see what the PBL decides and my money is on...games in rochester, maximize TV exposure.....its good for the whole league. To The basketball purists,.....if you and I had money in this deal we would do the same,bottom line is ..you look at the bottom line!
