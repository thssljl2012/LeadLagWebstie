The NBA rookie salary cap is probably the best aspect of their CBA (although I do love the whole making the contracts equal thing for trades.  Much more strategy and intrigue involved imo.)  For example, if the Wiz, God willing, win the lottery next month and are able to select Blake Griffin we are looking at paying him just 4 million per for the next four years.  In comparison the NFL is ****ing ridiculous.  #1 overall picks in the NFL are getting double that 16 mil total right off the bat.  And draft picks are much more riskier than in the NBA.
