WOW! I was expecting Stafford would've gotten something between $35 million and $39 million guaranteed. Tom Condon is one hell   of an agent.     It looks like that sort of stuff is going to come to an end when the new CBA is done.  Both the players and the owners want a rookie cap that pays players a certain ammount depending on where they are drafted -- ala the NBA.  Then more money will go the the solid vets who are getting screwed today.  Money goes to the first rounders who have done NOTHING and the superstars.
