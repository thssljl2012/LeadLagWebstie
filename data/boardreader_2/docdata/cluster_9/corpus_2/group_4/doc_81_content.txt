Ciron Black is a turnstile. At the start of the year I had him rated as a top 5 OT. 1/4 of the way through the year I dropped him to the 2nd round. At this point he is a huge DO NOT DRAFT...See the Troy South Carolina UGA and Alabama games for the reasons why.        Lindley is 100% coming out....He basically said it after the Vandy game.        My 1st round picks and I will list 3        1.Eben Britton    2.Russell Okung    3.Eugene Monroe            My second round picks I will list 3        1.Darius Butler CB    2.Tyson Jackson DE    3.Duke Robinson OG        May have to trade up for Robinson or Jackson        I will not steal Spush&amp;#039;s point about the 2010 CBA and the hard rookie cap the owners will jam down the NFPLA&amp;#039;s throats _________________
