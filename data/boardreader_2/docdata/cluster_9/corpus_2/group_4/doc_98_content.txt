Jalen Rose said Bosh will not re-sign with Toronto.    My take on the trade?  I don&amp;#039;t see Portland doing it.  They&amp;#039;ve got Aldridge cheap for another 2 years after this.  Rudy has legit all-star potential.  And Raef is a valuable expiring.  Why trade that group for someone who could leave you soon who&amp;#039;s not named Lebron?  At minimum, they&amp;#039;d have to have an affordable binding long-term agreement with Bosh to consider doing it.     Well, if Jalen said it it must be true considering he hasn&amp;#039;t even been around the team since being traded to the Knicks.  Remember all those people clamouring about Vince not re-signing with the Raptors once his rookie deal was over, guess what happened?  The fact is we can offer him the most money and the longest term when the economy seems to be turning for the worse and the year before the CBA will be renegotiated.  It&amp;#039;s more likely that all these guys with the exception of Lebron will re-sign with their own teams.  Whether they last long after that is a different story.
