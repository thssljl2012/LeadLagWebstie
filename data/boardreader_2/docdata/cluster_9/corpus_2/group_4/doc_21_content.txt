Well one of the main reasons it&amp;#039;s ok is because the players agreed to it when they signed the CBA. Also KGB is a vested vet and will be paid in full this year. Teams are allowed to cut players, players can hold out if they want, that doesn&amp;#039;t mean us as fans have to like it in either case.       One thing is for sure, after reading KGB&amp;#039;s press release, he understood it.
