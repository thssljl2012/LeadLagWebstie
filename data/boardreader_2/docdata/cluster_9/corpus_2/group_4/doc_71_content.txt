   The whole &amp;amp;quot; setting the market &amp;amp;quot; philosophy is quite simple.  The MLBPA wants one thing and one thing only; the players in the union to get paid as much as possible. If one owner thinks that a player is worth a stupid amount of money, that automatically means other players who are almost as good, are worth almost as much money.   Unfortunately, it would be a horrible precedent for any union, let alone a major sports union to say to its members &amp;amp;quot; yeah, go ahead and accept less money than what they are willing to give you. &amp;amp;quot; If they did that then they would never have a leg to stand on in negotiating the CBA.  I hate it too. I think it&amp;#039;s rediculous. Anyone who believes parity exists in MLB and that there is no favortism shown to large market teams is delusional. But the only way to stop it from happening is for every baseball fan to stop buying tickets to games, and that&amp;#039;s just not going to happen.
