Good teams spend money and as long as they spend it on the right players, they have a good team... yes, itys just that simple.    All we have managed to do is over pay for second tier talent like Denney, and Kelsay.    We are star depleted on this team, it affects us every week, and Ralph wont pay for the level of talent needed to significantly improve.    Dockery and Walker were great moves. Its THAT type of thing that makes us better. We did it one year out of a decade, not every year like we should be and not to bring in one of the top guys.     We wont sign Suggs even though he would be exactly the type of upgrade we need. Thats what Im talking about.    you get what you pay for.    consider this piece as well from a post Pat and I made a long time ago:  --------------                                                             http://www.forbes.com/2008/10/08/vik...er=yahoosports       Buffalo Bills       NFL    Value: $885 million (27/32)  Value three years ago: $708 million (25/32)  Market size: 1.1 million (No. 46 nationally)  The team&amp;#039;s fortunes are growing at a slower pace than the rest of the league. Playing in outdated Ralph Wilson Stadium, the Bills are already hosting a handful of home games across Lake Ontario in Toronto. The spiffier Rogers Centre brings in more revenue; if Toronto comes dangling more goodies to lure the Bills full-time, Buffalo will have a hard time trying to win a money war.  -----------------------------    Just found the cap figures:    2006 (after CBA) 102 mill  2007 109  2008 116.7     http://www.askthecommish.com/salarycap/numbers.asp     Thats a 6.4% increase from 06 to 07, and a 6.6% increase from 07 to 08    so our rate of growth is almost the same (at 6.6% ) as the growth rate of the salary cap.    Now, the cap goes up 7 mill, we make an  additional  59 mill, and we cant manage to keep up with the salary cap? Some people must be getting fat bonuses every year.    ----------------    and then you look at this and dont say Ralph is cheap?
