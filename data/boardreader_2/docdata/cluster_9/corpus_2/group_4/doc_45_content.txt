Simple question.  If the NBA didn&amp;#039;t have guaranteed contracts, like the NFL would they have a better product?  How would that effect FA, especially one big one in the near future.  Could the owners make more money, and still put the best product out there?  Some times I think that once some players get their money, they never put up the seasons like the ones before they earned their big contract (Erick Dampier for example).  Just curious what you guys think.  It sure would be nice to have the flexibility to be able to make a move to keep PLAYERS on the team.  When the Cap is around 70 mil, an you have a huge chunk of that tied up in a player that really is a waste of space....  Some of the immediate effects:  Expiring deals would have much less value to a rebuilding team in trade.  Play would improve.  I believe players would work harder to stay in the league.  The eddy curry&amp;#039;s would still eat their way out of the league, however.  Thoughts?
