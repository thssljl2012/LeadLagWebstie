Here&amp;#039;s what I did out of an old E-Mail I sent:        Quote:                         If the Colts cut him after June 1st, the cap hit will be $4.4mil in dead money   in 2009 and $3.0mil in dead money in 2010.     If the Colts cut him before June 1st, the cap hit will be $7.4mil in dead cap   money in 2009 unless they elect him as one of their &amp;#039;Post-June 1st cuts&amp;#039;. The   team is actually allowed to cut up to 2 players before June 1st and designate   them as Post-June 1st cuts if they carry the full amount of unamortized bonuses   (here $7.4mil) until June 1st, at which point it splits identically to if the   player was cut after June 1st ($4.4mil and $3.0mil)     The retirement issue is considerably more muddled.     If he retires before the end of the league year (March 1st), the team can recoup   the unamortized portion of his signing bonus ($2mil). Since he is removed from   the roster before June 1st, everything accelerates into 2009 (though I don&amp;#039;t   know if the Post-June 1st designation applies, I don&amp;#039;t have my CBA with me at   the moment...I&amp;#039;ll let you know when I do.) If that&amp;#039;s the case, then his 2009   cap hit will be $5.4mil.     If he retires after the start of the league year but before June 1st, then the   team can still recoup the bonus money, but in the form of a 2010 credit. In   otherwords, Harrison&amp;#039;s $1mil - $2mil in signing bonuses (again, depending on if   the Post-June 1st designation applies) will count against the 2009 cap, but the   team will get a credit of the same amount against the 2010 cap.     If he retires after June 1st, his 2009 cap hit will be the same as if he was cut   then ($4.4mil), but his 2010 cap hit will be a mere $1mil. This is because in 2010, he would have originally counted for $3mil against the cap, BUT that will   be reduced by $1mil for the 2010 signing bonus recoupment and be reduced by   another $1mil for the credit for the signing bonus paid in 2009 because he   retired after the start of the new league year.     The third option of course is a renegotiation of base salary, but even though I   don&amp;#039;t know Harrison personally, I just can&amp;#039;t see him agreeing to that.                     So, take those numbers and subtract them from Harrison&amp;#039;s 2009 and 2010 cap hit ($13.4 and $13mil, per) and that&amp;#039;s the savings.
