Are you serious?  Mangement has been shakey since Checkets left.  Blaming the success or lack of it on one player is Dantoni-ish.  They should have been traded Marbury. It&amp;#039;s not Marbury&amp;#039;s fault he&amp;#039;s here.  If a bill collecter buys off a bad debt you owe from somebody and comes knocking at your door who&amp;#039;s fault is that.  They knew what Marbury was owed when they aquired him so his contract isn&amp;#039;t an issue.  Use him or lose him.  That should be a part of next CBA.  If a player is physically fit to play and isn&amp;#039;t used for X amount of games he should be able to choose to be released and team should be able to aquire another player.
