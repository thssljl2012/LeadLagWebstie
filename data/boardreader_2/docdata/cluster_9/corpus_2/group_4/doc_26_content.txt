The new CBA is looking to change the rookie salary scale big time and while you might think it&amp;#039;s only a handful of 1st rd picks that will be effected........shock waves will be sent down through each round (less money for all rookies that don&amp;#039;t amke the league min) and my guess is there are going to rules set up defining when a player in each rd can apply for FA, incentives will be effected as well.   Nobody knows how and what they&amp;#039;re going to change reguarding the rules about rookie contracts.   Agents are advising any underclassmen who is talented enough to play in the league to get out now, because at least they know what the rules are, next year who knows what set of rules they&amp;#039;ll be playing under......and that likely means that the first 3-4 rounds will be full of talented players.
