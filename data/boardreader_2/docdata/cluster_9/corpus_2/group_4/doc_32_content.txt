Of course they can&amp;#039;t sign him.  It&amp;#039;s unfortunate, but I really don&amp;#039;t think they should get another pick.                           I think &amp;quot;death&amp;quot; is one of those things where exceptions could be made. I say give &amp;#039;em the compensatory pick.       1. The player didn&amp;#039;t really have a choice in dying, unlike choosing to hold out, or not signing, etc.       2. The only type of exception to the above exception, would be if criminal activity was involved. Ex: guy goes and murders someone, then offs himself. Then, no pick, IMO.      It&amp;#039;s a touchy subject no matter how one might phrase it, but it should be addressed, just in case.
