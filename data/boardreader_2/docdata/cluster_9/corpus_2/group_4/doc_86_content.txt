So that makes us ineligible to have a MLE this year.  I could be wrong though.    No.  You get a full MLE every year.  You can use that MLE to sign them for multiple years like we did with Kapono and then use it again the following year.  Its important to note that the pay structure of the MLE also follows normal league protocol.  That means you can give a raise of 10% per year (I believe) for every year of the contract.
