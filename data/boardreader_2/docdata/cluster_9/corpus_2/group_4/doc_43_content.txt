I think a happy meeting point would be... to get the contract off books immediately after a buy-out. Therefore, if you want the space to sign that big FA under the cap, then buying out the overpaid bum will help that.  The player deserves the money if the team wins him over by offering a 6 year contract. But if he is chronically injured, or on the decline, it&amp;#039;s stupid to continue to punish the team by blocking $10-15 million a year on a non-impact player.
