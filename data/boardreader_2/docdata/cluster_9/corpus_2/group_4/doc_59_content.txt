      ????        1st of all, we&amp;#039;re on the verge of no salary cap.    2nd of all, we have 20 million dollars in salary cap.  We&amp;#039;re in NO danger of cap hell    3rd of all, the current CBA and revenue sharing agreement (the TV contract is the best out of all major sports in the US) has allowed for the cap to increase SIGNIFICANTLY each year that has been in place since 2006.  I believe its about 7 million dollars per year.  They did this so teams could keep their own players.  There has been no major &amp;#039;cap&amp;#039; overhauls since the Tennessee and SF purges.  There&amp;#039;s a reason.        The cap is really a joke these days- the only thing thats really creating competitive balance is the salary floor. _________________           Romeo, win one for crakburn.
