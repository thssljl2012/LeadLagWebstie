Fellas what difference does it make if it is owned by a local person (group) or the cba?! I dont understand what everyone is complaining about, its a team, psbf if they are owned by the cba be happy that they havent pulled the team, and i would rather see 5 teams with good talent from 1 to 10 than a watered down team where there might be 3 or 4 good players on a team because the league is to big. psbf man just keep a positive mind set bro. theyll be a pitt team and to me it wouldnt matter to me who owned it, as long as i could see them play.
