I think Stafford, Cody and others will end up leaving since a lot of the guaranteed money will be no more.                                                      You are correct. The NFL does not want the highest paid players at a position to be rookies so this is the last year to get the huge rookie contracts. I believe guys that might have thought about staying one more year will go this year to get the big guaranteed money.
