I think its fantastic. I really didn&amp;#039;t like TBC at all, and the grind to 70 was a nightmare. My main is currently 77 and loving it. IIRC, I was only about 62-63 after 10 days of TBC being out and when I had gotten to 70, I cba gearing her up and tried levelling another char to 70, realising that I hated outland, especially hellfire peninsula.      Right now, I can&amp;#039;t decide which alt to level to 80, but can&amp;#039;t wait to get it started
