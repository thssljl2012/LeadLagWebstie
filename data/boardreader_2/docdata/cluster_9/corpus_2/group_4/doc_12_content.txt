The EPL (English Premeiere League) is sponsored by Barclays so does it mean only people who invest in the bank get to watch soccer? Canon Photo Marathon is a once a year event where photographer be it age or skill can get together to enjoy photography together. It is not only soley about Canon. It is about enjoying photography.It doesn&amp;#039;t matter what kind of gear you use or the brand that you actually carry. IMHO, winning the contest does not soley take a camera but skill and creativity is very very important.  It is a one of kind event in the world, so you should be proud to be able to take part.        But on a more serious note, Canon does have it own small outings for its users once awhile. If you had attended the course conducted at the training centre, you will realise that they do organise regular outings. I had attended one in June this year.                                               Im a nikon user...and i have to admit that I am impressed at how open minded the guys in canon are..this is proof that they are not insecure about their product and that their dedication for photography runs deep...so deep it cuts across camera labels...      Im a nikons user...and im proud to have taken part in the canon event...( i just wish nikon did the same)
