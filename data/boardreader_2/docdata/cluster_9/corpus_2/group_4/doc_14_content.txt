From Profootballtalk.com          Quote:                         Monday is the last day that teams can apply 2008 salary increases tothe 2008 salary cap. As to any contracts negotiated after Monday, base salary increases for 2008 would result (we believe) in the  proration of the amount over multiple cap years.    For the Packers, now would seem to be a good time to spend that $20  million or more in cap room, especially since they&amp;#039;ve yet to reach the  spending minimum.    In 2008, each team must spend 86.4 percent of the $116.2 million  limit, which equates to $100.396 million. If the Packers are more  than $20 million under the cap, then they&amp;#039;re $4 million or more away  from achieving the salary floor.    Some teams will attempt to carry cap space over to 2009 via so-called  &amp;amp;quot;Likely to Be Earned Incentives&amp;amp;quot; that, as a practical matter, won&amp;#039;t be  achieved in 2008. The union has balked about this practice in the  past, and it could become an issue in the looming CBA negotiations.                     They were actually talking about Greg Jennings, but the player isn&amp;#039;t the issue.     Just needed to spend the money, as we&amp;#039;re under the cap by a fair bit.          Quote:                         And wth are they gonna do with Brohm/Flynn?                     What did San Diego do when they had Brees/Rivers? What are Cleveland going to do with Anderson/Quinn?     Choose the better one and trade the other, obviously depending on how Brohm/Flynn develop, of course, if they don&amp;#039;t develop as expected then they get cut. It&amp;#039;s a win/win situation...     I&amp;#039;ve said it before, and I&amp;#039;ll say it again now...     Ted Thompson is a genius.     Trust in Ted.
