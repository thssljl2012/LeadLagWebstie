 I hope the Jets don&amp;#039;t mess around w/this and get a deal done, but I think there&amp;#039;s a decent chance they do play it close to the vest.  If a new CBA isn&amp;#039;t agreed to, 2010 becomes an uncapped year pushing the required service time to six years in order to be a FA. If the agreement is extended, Washington is a UFA after next year. If it&amp;#039;s not and 2010 is uncapped, he&amp;#039;s restricted.  Personally, I hope they just address his contract situation in the offseason as they have Thomas, Rhodes and Cotchery in recent seasons and show he&amp;#039;s part of the future of this team.    Tann has made some smart decisions as of late, he wont let Washington slip out of here, a dealshould be reached some time between now and the beginning ofthe summer
