              Anyone who has done their homework will know that the  Cavaliers  can offer him more money thanks to the current CBA (pretty enticing for a guy who has the stated goal of being the first billionaire athlete), the best chance to win championships (as of right now) among teams able to offer him a max deal (pretty enticing for somebody who grew up idolizing a certain #23 who did his share of winning rings) and they also have the finiancial flexibility to sign someone to a max deal (Bosh, STAT, you name them the Cavs have the money) in ADDITION to&amp;amp;nbsp;re-signing the King. Plus, none of the others can give him the ability to play his home games so close to his real home. People cite the endorsements he can get playing in NYC but&amp;amp;nbsp;wherever James plays will be the center of the NBA world for the next decade (especially if he&amp;#039;s teamed with someone like Bosh and playing for championships)&amp;amp;nbsp;so it&amp;#039;s not like he will get any more exposure playing for the  Knicks  than he will playing in Cleveland. Don&amp;#039;t hold your breath waiting for him to bolt Cleveland, the Cavs have to much leverage on the other teams looking to sign him.
