so, you can get a compensation pick for a high draft pick that you can&amp;#039;t sign because of other contract obligations, but in a life/death tragedy, your response is... that&amp;#039;s life?    so are you against the chartered compensation under the CBA for unsigned draft picks, or are you against compensating this extreme rare occurence while allowing the compensation rule in the CBA?  or, do you just not like the Rangers?    personally, I only think it&amp;#039;s fair they get compensation ... they have a point- Cherapanov should be treated as an unsignable high draft pick.
