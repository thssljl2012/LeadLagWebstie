Nick   &amp;amp;nbsp;   And of course even if true that team has to be NY, right? Are you aware the Cavs will have enough money to keep LeBron and sign another top FA (Bosh, Wade, etc.)?   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Don&amp;#039;t want to ruin your fun, but LeBron and his buddies signed shorter deals to keep their options open in case the new CBA allowed them to sign larger deals.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   No way LeBron could be a global icon in Cleveland, right? No one outside of here even knows who he is right now. Must have been my imagination he hosted SNL and the ESPYs and appears on a commercial every now and then.   &amp;amp;nbsp;  Will he stay in Cleveland? Certinaly not a given, but I believe he might go where he has the best chance to win a title, and there will be better pieces around him in Cleveland (than the Knicks) when the time comes to choose.        dtgoldie   &amp;amp;nbsp;   The Celtics were a dump and they got two players that put them over the top....The Knicks are just starting to revamp this team. 2010 is when you will see them an instant hit again. He wants the spotlight and it shines brighter in NY. Also, he is not even from Cleveland. He is from Akron. He will be gone soon, enjoy him while it lasts...          &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;   Nick Conley   &amp;amp;nbsp;
