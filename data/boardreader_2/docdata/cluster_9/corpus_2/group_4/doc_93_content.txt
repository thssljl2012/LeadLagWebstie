How is New York going to get Bosh or Wade? First of all, Wade is staying in Miami. There is no way that he will risk $33 million with his brittle body. Remember that per CBA rules, the team with your Bird rights can sign you for a much larger deal.   The same thing goes with Bosh. Why would Chris Bosh turn down $33 million to play in New York? Or will New York fans say Bosh will make loads of money in the city through endorsements?   This is all just pure crap. Look at A-Rod. How good were his endorsements when he went to New York? Why does LeBron make more money in endorsements than Jeter and A-Rod COMBINED when he plays in Cleveland?   Look, LeBron is not making that much more in New York. If anything he risks more because he would be perceived as a sell-out by many people. The arrogance/ignorance of the New York media is very high. Do they really feel that New York can transform LeBron into this billion dollar athlete? Do they really think anything other then winning will do that? Do you think MJ was MJ because he won his titles for Chicago as opposed to Charlotte? This is all so pathetic.   I tell you what New York fans, name me ONE athlete that was transformed into a true legend just because he played for New York. Just one. Find it for me. Hell, find it for me in any sport. My guess is that the only thing you can do is go back to the Yankee days.   For LeBron to do what he wants to do, no market will help him. He has to win titles. If he turns his back on his city and goes to New York and fails to win titles right away...he is the Alex Rodriguez of the NBA.
