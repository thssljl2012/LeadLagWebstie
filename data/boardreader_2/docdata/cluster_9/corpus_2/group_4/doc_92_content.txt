I think it&amp;#039;s pretty overrated.  There&amp;#039;s always big talk about FA classes a couple of years ahead of time, and then when the time actually comes, most of them have re-signed or been traded before being re-signed.  Do you really think that if Cleveland knows LBJ is going to leave, or even THINKS they will leave, they aren&amp;#039;t going to trade him midseason and get some amazing package in return?  Why hold a losing hand to the bitter end when they can get something awesome in return?  That&amp;#039;s why Ainge&amp;#039;s strategy is MUCH better.  Stockpile quality youth, picks, and some big expiring contracts.  Then you can trade for Bosh, Wade, LBJ, etc, whoever happens to be available.  Of course you still, have to re-sign them, but the fact is the team that owns the player can offer more years and money than anyone.  And in the NBA, money talks.  And presumably you wouldn&amp;#039;t trade for someone without assurances of a new contract.  I&amp;#039;d happily bring in any of those guys and pay them the max.  But my feeling is that all of them will either be re-signed by their home teams or traded before they hit the FA market.  History shows that to be the case.  So the idea is not to have capspace to sign those guys, but rather to have the necessary trade bait.  Capspace is the most overrated quantity in the CBA era, all it gets you is the chance to sign the Larry Hugheses of the world.
