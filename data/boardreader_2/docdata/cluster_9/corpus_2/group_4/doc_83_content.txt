They kind of already do this with guest players in the reserve league, but it may need to become more extensive and formalized.     I wonder what the union thinks of this. They should be happy for more senior jobs, and dropping 4 dev players increases the overall average salary. But it&amp;#039;s still 56 jobs cut (if you ignore the fact that some teams didn&amp;#039;t have the full 28 players), though two expansion teams in the next two years (48 players) will make up most of the difference. I think replacing 56 dev slots with 40 senior slots and 8 dev slots should be seen by the union as a net positive.      Hopefully they increase the salary cap at least enough to add the two new senior players without cutting into the existing senior players&amp;#039; pay .                      I think that raising the MLS Salary Cap is a work in progress. When this CBA ends, I have a feeling that it will be raise to at least 5.1mil maybe more. I just can&amp;#039;t see this league getting better with a Cap less than 5mil.
