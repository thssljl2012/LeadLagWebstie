 Obviously the Giants are on the table, but does anyone think any other team can become the next dynasty, following the 00&amp;#039;s Patriots?   we need to take into account the CBA being reworked and the end of the cap era....i would list Cowboys, Washington and the Jets as teams willing to spend to win in the coming decade
