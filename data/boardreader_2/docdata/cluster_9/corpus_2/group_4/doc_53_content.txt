My best guess says the that average contracts of all players might factor into the equation for determining the monetary floors and ceilings of each round. Others think it&amp;#039;s solely an inflation based equation using the prior year numbers plus the inflation percentage of the salary cap.     My best guess says the floors and ceiling numbers are agreed upon before matching up the players to the Comp picks. I forget if there are limits for any specific round, and I don&amp;#039;t feel like digging  in the CBA tonight . That&amp;#039;s my lazy answer.                        Is it even there?  I thought it was top secret stuff...
