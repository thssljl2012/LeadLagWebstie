   Just to clarify a few thing for the bandwagon NYR haters out there;  1. The Rangers did not do this in public, but rather behind closed doors, at the GM meetings, where no reporters are allowed. They spoke to the media AFTER the story was somehow leaked to the press and appeared in the papers.   2. As a business, there is no NHL team in the league that would not have done the same thing. NY lost its best prospect, and is interpreting the CBA in a way that may compensate them for this loss. You can say &amp;#039;your&amp;#039; team wouldn&amp;#039;t have done this, but you would be wrong, this is multimillion dollar businneses here folks, dont be so nieve.   3. The only thing that you can really pick on is the timing. It would have been nice to have waited a while out of respect, however, everyone seems to be forgeting that an extension to the CBA is being negotiated NOW, not three months from now, and this issues will likely have to be addressed with new language in the CBA.   So, please get off your high horses, its unfortunate that this issue was not kept private, but this is the necessary course of business for any NHL club. If the CBA is amended to address this issue, and it happens again, I dont think any of &amp;#039;your&amp;#039; teams would pass up the compensatory pick out of respect....      once again, the rangers are the only team that will do this, and its already been proved by the flames not taking the compensation for losing oneof its drafted players who they didn&amp;#039;t sign. but right every nhl team would do it if they had the chance.   if the flames had the right to a compensatory pick and didn&amp;#039;t take it, that just shows their organization is run terribly. you guys go nuts saying the rangers go public, blah blah blah. reporters seek stories and get the story. while the rangers didn&amp;#039;t hide anything, they didn&amp;#039;t exactly call a press conference.  the world doesn&amp;#039;t stop turning after a tragic death. the rules stipulate draft pick compensation for an unsigned player two years after being drafted. the circumstances here are sad of course, but anyone bashing the rangers fails to put it in perspective. whoever made that len bias comparison is an idiot for one simple reason: the rangers aren&amp;#039;t asking for a handout. they&amp;#039;re asking for enforcement of a rule w/in the CBA. any organization w/o an idiot at the helm would do the same thing.  you people are turning a non-issue into some horrible and disgusting act when it isn&amp;#039;t. just an excuse to bash the rangers w/your pathetic hatred. get over it for crying outloud.
