What most likely happened is that along with the two players and the pick, Philly sent Minnesota a check for around $2.5M that Minnesota could use to pay all of Booth&amp;#039;s salary and about 2/3 of Carney&amp;#039;s salary.    Got it.  Its another example of the news getting it wrong with its &amp;amp;quot;continue to pay&amp;amp;quot;     Philadelphia Daily News wrote:  When he needed just a little more space, he traded Carney and Calvin Booth to the Minnesota Timberwolves, ostensibly for a second-round draft choice. He even  agreed to continue to pay  Booth&amp;#039;s salary and about two-thirds of Carney&amp;#039;s salary.     So now I&amp;#039;m wondering .. does CBA rules require extra cash be paid at the time of the trade?  And in a related question, how does MEM demand last month that NYK pay two thirds of Zach&amp;#039;s salary in a trade when CBA limits the cash to $3 mil?  That another rumor gone bad in the papers?
