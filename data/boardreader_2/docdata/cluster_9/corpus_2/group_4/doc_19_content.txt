In this case the Player will have no loss of pay. He is guaranteed to get paid in full for this years contract whether or not another team picks him up.       The team is allowed to cut players in order to better the team by signing someone who they think has a better chance of helping them which is for the betterment of the team and the fans.       The player is not harmed in this type of transaction, his services contract for pay is still honored and the team gets to do what is in their best interest as well. it is part of the CBA.       If you feel the same way about long term contracts then you need to know that there are clauses in those contracts as well allowing the team to cut them by certain dates if the team see fit. This is why there are bonuses as well. It is all a result of the CBA.       I understand your point of view but the player is not really harmed much in these situations.
