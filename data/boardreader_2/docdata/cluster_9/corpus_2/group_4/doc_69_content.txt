          .              As long as they pay him and providethe benefits outlined in his dealand the CBA, the union&amp;#039;s not that interested in a playing time issue between a player and a team. Why?? Because another of its members will be getting the PT. It&amp;#039;s not like he&amp;#039;s having to endureterrible working conditions. What the union probably wants to avoid is a player taking too small a percentage of the salary he&amp;#039;s due in a buyout in an effort to sign somewhere else. THAT would concern them.   This is far more than a playing time issue.
