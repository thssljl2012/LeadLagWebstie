Washington is basically locked into the Jets for the next two years.  He is under contract for 2009 and because the owners opted out of the CBA he will only be a restricted FA in 2010.  I like Leon, but I would not go crazy giving him a deal if some other team throws a ton of money at him after that.  He is a great special teams player, but is mainly a once a set player if that.  You cant invest too much money in a player like that, Different story if he becomes more of a 3 down threat ala Tiki Barber, but until that happens I would proceed with caution.
