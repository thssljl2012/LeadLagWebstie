   If LeBron has learned anything at all, it is that D wins championships. The only thing anyone thinks about D and Mike D&amp;#039;Antonie is there always seems to be a severelack of it on his teams.   That being said...excellent post, col69nel. I use that site, as well. I&amp;#039;ve had it in my favs for about 3 years now and I  still  don&amp;#039;t have it all down yet!! I apologize for making the incorrect statement in another thread about the CBA ending in 2010. It ends in 2011 with a league option for 2012. So, sorry if I screwed anybody up.  A couple things...I think your 70 mil figure is pretty high. I mean, with the economic climate and forecast looking pretty bleak for a while, I would think the next 2 seasons wouldn&amp;#039;t see much more than a 5.5mil rise. Maybe it hits 65mil. It changes all the numbers up a bit, but still looks to favor the Cavs pretty heavily. Even with LeBron&amp;#039;s 150% cap hold, we should still have enough to offer a max to another player. Our 2 draft choices, assuming we don&amp;#039;t trade them away, will more than likely be late first rounders and minimal against the cap. All these teams like the Knicks are going to have higher picks and thus even more money against their caps by that time.  Great post, though.   I like 70 because I can multiply 30% by 70 and get 21, and thats a nice number. 30% times 65 is 19.5, which is so much harder to add (sarcasm).  People go and talk about all the teams that &amp;quot;have less than XXXX dollars committed for 2010&amp;quot;. What they don&amp;#039;t mention is that most of the teams under that threshhold have complete crap signed. We have Mo, West, Gibson and the rooks signed. (Atlanta, Sacto and a few other have comparable numbers). If winning is important to these guys, Cavs have an edge there.  Of course, lets just win it all this year, which pretty much gurantees LeBron will stay ;-D.    Oh, I know. Look at our flippin backourt in 2010. There is not another team in this league that can match it right now.Then again, Delonte West is too small to guard guys like Joe Johnson andVince Carter(sarcasm turned up to HIGH).  As far as the salary cap number, the lower it ends up being, the better for us. These teams  have to realize they are going to have to put something more significant on the court than Eddy flippin Curry and Danilo Gallinari, for cryin out loud. And to do that, you  have  to spend money.High draft picks don&amp;#039;t help the cause, either.  The only thing that scares me is trading. It&amp;#039;s hard to figure what some of these GM&amp;#039;s are thinking with these trades sometimes, so you never know what could go down there.  But, you are definitely right. We win a Title and it not only makes it very tough for LeBron to leave, it makes it very enticing forguys like Bosh or Stoudemire to join us.  Mo Williams/Gibson  West/  LeBron/  Hickson/Jackson  Stoudemire  That is one potentially sick lineup right there.
