           Bradford is a RS sophomore so he could come out if he wanted. There&amp;amp;#039;s a lot of talk that guys are going to come out early if they can before the league&amp;amp;#039;s next CBA which could implement a rookie cap.   As of now, Lions will probably take Stafford. Unless they really believe Drew Stanton is their guy. I would love for the Chiefs to get Stafford but it doesn&amp;amp;#039;t appear that will happen. They&amp;amp;#039;ll probably go for a DE like Orakpo.
