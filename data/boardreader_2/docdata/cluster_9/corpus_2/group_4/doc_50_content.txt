It&amp;#039;s so teams cannot abuse the CBA.  For example, Lets say Team A is under the cap by 9.5 Mil.  Team B has a player Z they wish to dump with a salary of 10 mil, they are currently over the cap.  Team A sends a player they like,(player X) who makes 4.2 mil, in exchange for Player Y from Team b.(3.7 mil)  Team A is now under the cap by 10 mil, and can absorb player Z, and trade X back for Y.  Effectively, Team A and Team B have circumvented the CBA, and made illegal trades legally.  So now, Team A has Player Z and X, and Team B has player Y, something that never shoud&amp;#039;ve happened in the first place.
