 I totally get what your saying, but that&amp;#039;s just not how it works. The way it works with pitchers like Hamels is, he will most likely get a long term contract that buys out his arbitration and possibly 1 or 2 of his FA years. He&amp;#039;s not going to make 15 million in arbitration this year, he&amp;#039;s going to make around 5. He&amp;#039;s either going to get the 5 or they may try and work out a contract. If they do try to work out a contract, it will be comparable to what he would have gotten in arbitration this year, and he will get raises in all subsequent years. If they buy out a year or two of FA, it will be beneficial to the Phillies because it woul presumebly be for an amount much less than he&amp;#039;d get on the open market.  That&amp;#039;s just how contracts work, and that is how the CBA is setup. I get it that there are few pitchers in the league that are better than Cole, but most of the guys that are making the big bucks have the service time, which is what the CBA is setup to award.  I know it stinks and doesn&amp;#039;t make sense, but neither does paying Eaton 8 million to sit at home or pitch for another team.
