  First of all, Corey is not a shut down corner.....he has good amount of INTs this year sure, because they were thrown right in his bread basket....He started last year for us than was benched. He got his job back due to injury in the playoffs and has performed great since than. But if you guys think hes a shut down corner you need to clear your heads of his NFC Championship game heroics and be realistic.....I like him in NY but he is far from are #1 priority, hes not even our #1 priority on defense i dont think, Cofield who will be a FA is.   Also as 3 side notes..... 1. They gave Plax a huge extension already, dont see why they wouldnt for BJ 2. Giants are in great shape as far as salary cap goes.....also keep in mind that there is a 90% chance that there will be no salary cap in 2010, so look for them to pay BJ reasonably for 2009, and have his contract explode in 2010 (just like jerry jones has done with Marion Barber, Roy Williams and Tony Romo) 3. This past offseason before the raiders slapped the franchise tag on Nmandi Ashmouha (sp.?), the Giants had a very hefty offer waiting to hand to him. Nmandi has a contract clause that says he cant have the Franchise tag used on him in back to back years.....so look for the Giants to again offer that contract  &amp;quot;There is a 90% chance there will be on cap in 2010.&amp;quot;   Come on, yes there is a chance that the CBA will run out and there will be no salary cap, but you are simply making up the 90% part.    If that werent the case, and the percentage wasnt taht high.....why would most of the owners be setting up player contracts low in 2009, and top heavy in 2010.....because they know there will be no cap.....if the chance was lower why would so many owners put there franchises in deep trouble? They wouldnt....
