                     What does the union have to do with playing time?? Marbury&amp;#039;s situation is pretty simple -- his expiring contract is far more valuable than any contribution he gives on the court.  The union is there to ensure he is treated in a fair manner. Telling . If all he isto them is an expiring contract and they have nointention of using him, why do they care if he violates his contract or plays with his HS team. If he violates his contract, they get out of it now as opposed to the summer. If he gets injured, they weren&amp;#039;t going to play him anyways.  They&amp;#039;re simply doing thisto &amp;quot;punish&amp;quot; him. .       As long as they pay him and providethe benefits outlined in his dealand the CBA, the union&amp;#039;s not that interested in a playing time issue between a player and a team. Why?? Because another of its members will be getting the PT. It&amp;#039;s not like he&amp;#039;s having to endureterrible working conditions. What the union probably wants to avoid is a player taking too small a percentage of the salary he&amp;#039;s due in a buyout in an effort to sign somewhere else. THAT would concern them.    Pay is always a unions concern. But Marbury isn&amp;#039;t playing 20 years. By limiting his ability to play by putting him on the inactive list they have left him with no way to appeal. It&amp;#039;s not a suspension. They&amp;#039;re also taking a year of his career. The fact they negotiating a buyout is indicative of the Knick realizing they cannot maintian the existing situation. Marbury cannot play for another team in the nba unless the knicks waive him.
