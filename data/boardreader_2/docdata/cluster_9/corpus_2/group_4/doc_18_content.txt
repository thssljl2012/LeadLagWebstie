                                                                   I say if they&amp;#039;re going as a package they know it will have to be for 14 -15 mil and we will be putting in an offer, although it will probably be unsuccessful.      My idea:      Matching 10 year deals. First 6 years 10 million per, last 4 league minimum for a 6.2ish cap hit.      Have a back door agreement with them that they will be waived after 6, no one will pick them up and they both refuse to report to springfield so we don&amp;#039;t have to pay the rest of their contract or cap hit.      They get - 60 million and blackballed in a country they probably won&amp;#039;t reside in anyway    We get - 2 players in their prime for a decent cap hit and the collapse of the CBA      It could work
