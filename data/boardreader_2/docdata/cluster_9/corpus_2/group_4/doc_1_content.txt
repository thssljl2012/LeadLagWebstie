Time to sweat again... oooooooo                                                      Guys, something to take note when you are shooting a golf event. You need to be extreme quiet when the golfers taking the shot. The noise from the shutters will disturb the golfers concentration. Most of the time you may need a lens with 200mm and above focal length. You may not be standing closer to the golfers. Please do a study on how to shoot golf events, there are more rules involve than other sports. Cheers!
