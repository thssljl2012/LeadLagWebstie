The number of picks per round are not set. The NFL does not award them based on the same numbers per round each year. They always vary.     Every year the thresholds per round also increase. A guy who got $6 mill/year about five years ago would have been a guaranteed third rounder. Now, he might be closer to edging into the fifth round. Inflation ....     I think when we got a Comp pick for Brees, that was the only third round Compensatory pick for that draft.      There will always be 32 Compensatory picks awarded by the NFL. It&amp;#039;s a rule in the CBA. 32. No more, no less. If there are not 32 eligible compensatory FA&amp;#039;s to match up with the draft picks, then the remaining picks are given out in the order of the draft until 32 picks total are reached.                         True. Let&amp;#039;s look at the number of 3rd rounders given out every year back to 2000:  2008: 4  2007: 4  2006: 1  2005: 6  2004: 1  2003: 0  2002: 2  2001: 3  2000: 0     Never 8, which is where DFlo&amp;#039;s contract is ranked.      bman65 makes a good point. If any of those teams in front of us (NE, Pitt, Cin, Cards, Chi, Giants, NO) gained equal or more FAs before the cutoff than they lost, then they may have lost their slot. I&amp;#039;ll have to check into that...
