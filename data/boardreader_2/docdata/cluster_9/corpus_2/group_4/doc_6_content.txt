 personally i think its bs...i think the rangers are looking for a hand out and i wish this never came out to the public because it makes the rangers look terrible   lets ask this...what happens if a player, say Luke Scheen, played in his 10th game and gets severely injured and never plays another game. should toronto get a low pick because he only played 10 professional games in his career, im sorry but why should the other teams in the NHL also lose out because of the untimely death of Cherepanov.  when you draft a player, you take a risk that not only is that player going to be healthy but good enough to make your roster. no team should benefit whether its because of injury death or bad judgement in drafting someone.   Except that according to the CBA, if Cherepanov does not yet sign a contract with the team, and:  1) his heart condition was discovered and was never able to play in the NHL, the Rangers would get a compensation pick. 2) he was revived and told to never lace &amp;#039;em up again, the Rangers would have received a draft pick.  So they aren&amp;#039;t looking for a hand out. They looking for what is owed to them according to the CBA that all the teams agreed to. Now I agree that this looks bad for the organization, but it was brought up at the GM meetings, and was not meant to be made public. The Rangers didn&amp;#039;t go to the press to put pressure on the league, it was leaked by someone.
