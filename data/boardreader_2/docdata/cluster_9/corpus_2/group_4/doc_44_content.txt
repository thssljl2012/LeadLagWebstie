Each and every NBA owner is a supertalented, highly accomplished, take-no-prisoners businessman -- surely you&amp;#039;re not suggesting that such an animal needs some sort of built-in protection from making a personnel mistake?  It&amp;#039;s set in stone, I think, even with the less-than-rosy long-term economic outlook and diminished TV ratings. Personally, I wouldn&amp;#039;t mind doing away with fully guaranteed contracts -- if at the same time rookie contracts were partially or completely deregulated.  Back to the NFL for a minute. Yeah, it&amp;#039;s &amp;amp;quot;great&amp;amp;quot; that you&amp;#039;ve got a bunch of scrubs on every roster attacking every special teams play like it was their last, but consider the flip side: the low minimum and average salaries; the relatively abbreviated playing careers (53 games per the NFLPA); the chronic lifelong medical conditions many players face as a direct consequence of injuries sustained during their careers . . .   Sure, they have a choice not to play, and they go into it with their eyes wide open, but with revenues of ~$10 billion a year and rising, I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s off-base to consider the lack of guaranteed money borderline immoral.
