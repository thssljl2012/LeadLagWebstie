It is likely to be one of the main points of contention in the next round of CBA negotiations.  The commissioner was making noise about this when Jake Long got the contract he got.  He wants to limit the amount of bonus money these guys get.      I&amp;#039;d like to see them go with a rookie pay structure similar to what the NBA does in that if you are a #1 pick or a day one pick the first two or three years of your contract is guaranteed and then after that it is up to how well you have played to that point.    But, we all know the players are not going to go for giving up the big signing bonuses if they don&amp;#039;t get something back in terms of guaranteed contracts for veterans.  As it stands now teams can basically cut a guy whenever the spirit moves them.
