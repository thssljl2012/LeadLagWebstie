It seems that Forbes reports Kobe is to make $36 million gross in the US this year counting his endorsements. So this Greek club is offering the same as $70 million gross. So even if he never got another dime of endorsement money by going to Greece (which would not make any sense really) it would still be $34 million more raise per year from what he makes in the US now.    Stern is going to have to seriously do something about the CBA IMO.
