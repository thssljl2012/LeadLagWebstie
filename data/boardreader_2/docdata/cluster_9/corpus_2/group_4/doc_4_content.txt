               i just read about the russian player who died a month ago and the  Rangers  are now asking for an additional pick (17th overall) in the next draft.&amp;amp;nbsp; I know the rule is in the&amp;amp;nbsp;CBA agreement, but the problem i have with this is supposedly this player was playing illegally.&amp;amp;nbsp; i do not know the whole story, but i was wondering what everybody else&amp;#039;s thought was on this.&amp;amp;nbsp;     personally, i think the rangers should get an additional pick next year.&amp;amp;nbsp; not the 17th overall pick.&amp;amp;nbsp; if it is found that he was playing illegally, then there&amp;#039;s a problem.&amp;amp;nbsp; i believe the rangers could get another pick.&amp;amp;nbsp; maybe the last pick in the 1st round or possibly later in the draft.&amp;amp;nbsp; has the autopsy come back on this guy?&amp;amp;nbsp; there weren&amp;#039;t any drugs, were there?&amp;amp;nbsp; the only thing i&amp;#039;ve been hearing that he did wrong was the military obligation thing.    i understand the rangers point of view though.     what do u think?
