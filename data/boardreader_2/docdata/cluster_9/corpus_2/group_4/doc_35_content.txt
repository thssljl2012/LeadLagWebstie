                                                                   I was never a Sather fan but that&amp;#039;s beside the point . I really think this wording in the CBA is a moot point and will get the Rangers and Sather nothing but bad PR. The NHL does some silly things but they will not compensate the Rangers as a result of Cherepanov&amp;#039;s death .
