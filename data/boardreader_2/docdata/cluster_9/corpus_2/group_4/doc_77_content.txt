It&amp;#039;s $30 million NET, or about $70 million gross (not only is it the AFTER tax salary, the team also pays the AGENT FEES). That means the Lakers would have to pay $70 million a year, which they can&amp;#039;t under CBA rules to match it. It&amp;#039;s $20 million higher than that $50 million figure Kobe mentioned before.    Remember Childress signed for  $20 million net for 3 years  with this same club,  which ESPN said was worth more than the Hawks full MLE for 5 years.
