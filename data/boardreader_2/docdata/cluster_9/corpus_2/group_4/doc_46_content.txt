Bottom line is this; If he was injured and unable to play again (before he is signed), the Rangers get a pick, plain and simple, thats what the CBA says. Their argument is essentially that death is quite the serious injury, so they should get the pick. No matter how gingerly they try to approach this subject, they look like jackals, but there would not be any argument if Cheraponov suffered a couple of carreer ending concussions or something before he was signed.....I say they should ask the KHL for Jagr as compensation for being so stupid as to not have a friggin defib on hand (and an ambulance of course), the damn things are only like 2-3 grand....LOL
