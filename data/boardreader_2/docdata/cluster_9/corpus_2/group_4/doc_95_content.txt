 This isn&amp;#039;t a loophole; it is a CBA rule that is clearly spelled out.  If the league thought it was destroying the fabric of salary matching, the rule would be more than 30 days waiting period.      Besides, first the player has to clear waivers.  If that player is desirable, any team can grab him and his contract in 48 hours...except Detroit.  McDyess has no say in the matter if another team grabs him off waivers. Another team can even use a Trade Exception to grab him.      These types of trades aren&amp;#039;t going to occur that much, because there is a measure of gambling involved.  You have to be sure that no other team in the league will accept the player&amp;#039;s contract and claim him off waivers.  Plus you have to be completely sure the player will indeed refuse to sign with anyone else for 30-days should he clear waivers.  Not to mention you have to find a team like Denver who is willing to waive the player and negotiate a buyout in the first place.      The combination of all those things happening will make it rare that a team can trade a desirable player and get him right back in 30 days.
