   I got the impression years ago Big Daddy $tern did not like team&amp;#039;s buying players out and the Loofies always do what their daddy tells them to do. I could be wrong but I think awhile back it was not something the NBA or the union liked to happen and it has since been change in the new CBA to make it easier. I think the NBA did not like the idea of a player being able to &amp;quot;tank&amp;quot; his game and get a buyout if he wanted to change teams and I think the union did not like the idea of a player not getting 100% of the cash from his contract. I believe the teams and players where able to &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; some attitudes on both sides to get it more accepted but the Loofies don&amp;#039;t have the guts to pull it off. The trouble is it takes both the team and the player to agree to it and in this case why would Thomas, who is not in high demand, want to get less than his full salary when no team might want him for any amount?
