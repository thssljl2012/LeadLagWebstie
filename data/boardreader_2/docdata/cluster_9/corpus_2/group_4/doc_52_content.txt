Hopefully, Turner makes the cut.                      That&amp;#039;s another aspect of this whole mess that is rarely addressed.      The number of picks per round are not set.  The NFL does not award them based on the same numbers per round each year.  They always vary.      Every year the thresholds per round also increase.  A guy who got $6 mill/year about five years ago would have been a guaranteed third rounder.  Now, he might be closer to edging into the fifth round.  Inflation ....      I think when we got a Comp pick for Brees, that was the only third round Compensatory pick for that draft.        There will always be 32 Compensatory picks awarded by the NFL.  It&amp;#039;s a rule in the CBA.  32.  No more, no less.  If there are not 32 eligible compensatory FA&amp;#039;s to match up with the draft picks, then the remaining picks are given out in the order of the draft until 32 picks total are reached.
