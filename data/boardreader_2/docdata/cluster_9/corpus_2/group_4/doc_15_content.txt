After further review I believe NS is correct; the &amp;#039;20% rule&amp;#039; is valid through the entirety of contract and may affect salary if the upper limit is lowered.

I had to look up the &amp;quot;100% rule&amp;quot; last night, as the payment schedule of the contract looked a little off to me as well.  It&amp;#039;s kosher: the allowable decrease in salary from year to year should be not less than 50% of the lesser of the first two years of the contract.     In this case the allowable decrease from year to year is $7M * 50% = $3.5M
