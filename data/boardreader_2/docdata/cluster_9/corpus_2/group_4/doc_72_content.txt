If revenues do actually go down then the players may not get their escrow payment that year.       THEN, the Salary Cap might be adjusted downward.     ..     Hockey was so much more fun in the old days without having to consider the economics of it all!     sigh    Been reading threads regarding this for months and ZZ...you are the first to even mention this.  When the new CBA was implemted there was a rollback and 7% added in an escrow account for that very reason.Its known as the cap CUSHION.The cap will not go lower next year...the year after is the earliest.The interest from this account at this point could possibly sustain for 2 seasons.The NHLPA has tried to recover this escrow money since the cap increased so rapidly but the NHL is still in control of it.    As for the bobsie twins...no thanks.
