Therefore, if you want the space to sign that big FA under the cap, then buying out the overpaid bum will help that.  The player deserves the money if the team wins him over by offering a 6 year contract. But if he is chronically injured, or on the decline, it&amp;#039;s stupid to continue to punish the team by blocking $10-15 million a year on a non-impact player.   The problem with that it is circumvents the spirit of the salary cap. Teams that are financially flush would be more easily able to cut &amp;amp;quot;bum&amp;amp;quot; players and still be able to pay them, whereas teams that may be financially hurting (or are just trying to be fiscally responsible) may not be so able (or willing) to.
