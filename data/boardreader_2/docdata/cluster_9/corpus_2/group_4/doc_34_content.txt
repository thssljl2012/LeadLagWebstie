For instance, could we use the cap space to sign Iverson to a 3 year, 25 million dollar deal with a salary progression of 20/2.5/2.5?     Dumars can do is sign AI to a 1 yr 20 mill deal and then resign him the next yr to 3 yrs at 6.7 mill so as to give him 4 yrs 40 mill.  That would allow the Pistons to have 25 mil under the cap and sign  Amare and Dirk.    Stuckey AI Prince Dirk Amare   with Rip and Amir coming off the bench.    Still lots of possibilities and every name is hypothetical.  i just believe the Dirks, Tmacs, Redds and JJs are going to give you that contender discount and play for less while the young 04 turks are going to want top dollar.
