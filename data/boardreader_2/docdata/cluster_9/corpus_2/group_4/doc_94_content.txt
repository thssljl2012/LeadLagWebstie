If the league felt it undermined the salary matching rule and wanted a one-year ban instead of a one-month ban, they&amp;#039;d have to negotiate it with the player&amp;#039;s union.  In fact, the one-month ban is likely a compromise between the league wanting a longer ban and the union wanting no restriction on the player&amp;#039;s choice.
