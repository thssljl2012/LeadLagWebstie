  I think a happy meeting point would be... to get the contract off books immediately after a buy-out. Therefore, if you want the space to sign that big FA under the cap, then buying out the overpaid bum will help that.    I think the original point was that players often give up after getting their contract and stop trying as hard.   Buy-outs wouldn&amp;#039;t help that.   It&amp;#039;d help teams shake up their rosters more, but it wouldn&amp;#039;t increase the overall effort in the league any.
