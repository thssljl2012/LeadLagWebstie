                                                                   Also, as mentioned before, most players receive their signing bonus up front which allows the player to invest it as they see fit.    And, I would not doubt in this case if the signing bonus was used so the Senators could tag on that $1 million 4th year.    If Alfredssons salary had been structured as $9.1 million - $7 million - $4.5 million -  $1 million, I think that final year violates a CBA clause about what percentage a players salary can decrease from year to year.
