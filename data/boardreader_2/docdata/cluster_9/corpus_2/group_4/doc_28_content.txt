Still no comment on not having a cap next year, huh?              heres a start        $131M payroll right now        Corey Williams:  salary escalates an additional $6M         Donte Stallworth:  if cut, $1.4M of dead cap space.  If retained,  $6.9M        Shaun Rogers:  salary escalates by about $7M        Eric Steinbach:  salary escalates at least $2M        right there is nearly $20M in salary escalators just between 4 players.          Should I keep going or are you actaully going to present a fact rather than just mocking everything while bringing nothing to the discussion ??        On top of that,  they have to find a way to pay Braylon Edwards,  and find a safety for next year if they dont retain the overrated Sean Jones.             I would like to add that there IS a salary cap next year.  There will not be one in 2010 if there is no CBA.  I&amp;#039;m willing to bet that there will be a CBA by then. _________________      &amp;amp;quot;You may be able to convince me that I am wrong, but you may not tell me that I am wrong without convincing me.&amp;amp;quot; -Fidel Castro
