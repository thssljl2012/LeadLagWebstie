The mistake people are making when assessing whether Bosh is making the max, is that they don't realize the LeBrons, Kobes and Chris Pauls of the world are actually having their value constrained by the CBA. On an open market, these types of players would be making well over the max. Just because Bosh is making the max, doesn't automatically mean that he is equal to Kobe/CP3/Lebron etc. Lebron could have 4 times the value Bosh has (say for argument's sake that on the open market, Lebron can get $100 million a year and Bosh can only get $25 million a year.) and still be justified in being paid the same as Bosh under the CBA structure we have. It's either get a sure thing (barring injury) for $20 million or roll the dice and hope to match his production with 3 Kapono-level signings at $6-7 million a piece. We got extremely lucky with the Parker/Garbajosa signings in 2006, you can't expect to make out so well all the time.
