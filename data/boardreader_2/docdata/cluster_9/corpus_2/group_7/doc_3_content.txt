Now other contracts may have more money for that player's 2009 contract year, which may led to us having less that 17 mil in effective cap space. I don't know all the details for the Heat's big contracts, but we can expect a fair chunk of change to be freed up if we just let Marion walk.   You can operate under the cap if you so choose, but I doubt many franchises in our situation (close to being championship competitive) would choose to operate under the cap and would elect to sign a player. The most logical business decision is for us to turn this expiring contract into assets via trades. Teams wanting to get rid of a piece that isn't working would love to send that player off in favor of an expiring contract. NBA CBA rules dictate that the contracts must match, which means they can get rid of a player they don't want who has multiple years to pay left for a player with an expiring contract...thus allowing them to clear the books of that traded player's contract sooner.    Thanks !!
