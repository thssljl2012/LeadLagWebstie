Leave what happened prior to 2004 well enough alone and let the game move on to a new era. Otherwise we're going to hear about this at least every single January for the next two decades when the annual BBWAA HOF results are announced.                         I believe that's incorrect.  I believe they were banned in the early '70s, but testing was first included in the CBA in '04.      There's a theory out there that Arod's admission qualifies him for suspension under that rule.  He didn't need to be tested, he admitted it himself.      I do agree with much of your post though.  I think the records will stand with no asterisk.      The court of public opinion will be a far more severe penalty to all involved in this one.  The Scarlet Letter will follow all these guys around the rest of their lives.
