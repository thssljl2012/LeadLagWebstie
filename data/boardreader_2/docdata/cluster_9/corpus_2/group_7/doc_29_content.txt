we all know that the salaries for developmental players in this league are ridiculous. Can't blame someone for wanting to earn a salary on which it's actually possible to live as opposed to having to take a 2nd or even 3rd job. "Mom doesnt that guy in McDonald's remind you of the player we saw last night in the Red bulls game?" "No, Johnny, Im sure that cant be him, soccer players dont work at McDonald's!!"       If I remember correctly this is the 2nd time Red Bull has lost out on a promising young player because of how low the salaries are for rookies (excluding Gen Adidas which is a world unto itself). You can bet this will be a sticking point in the upcoming CBA negotiations. No one is asking for a superstar salary, i dont think that asking for at least 20 to 23 thou a year is asking for too much.
