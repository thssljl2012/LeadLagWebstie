Local ATM is targeted for 5th time [The Herald-Sun, Durham, N.C.] Knight Ridder/Tribune    "Business News " Feb. 25 -- DURHAM -- Police are trying to identify a man who robbed a woman at the automatic teller machine at a Bank of America branch at 4811 Hope Valley Road on Feb. 9 . The same ATM was the site of crimes four times last year. The woman in question was withdrawing money at the ATM about 6:20 a.m. Feb. 9 when a man ran up behind her car, threw a large rock through the back window of the car and demanded money. The woman drove off without giving the man any money, but left a small amount of cash unclaimed in the ATM pay slot. The robber took that cash, according to Detective William Coghill of the Durham Police Department . Coghill said on Tuesday that he believes one man committed all four robberies at the drive-through ATM last year, but he doesn't believe he is the same person who committed this month's robbery. In last year's cases, the robber used a gun, and in the most recent case, he used a rock. He said there were other physical differences in the description of the robbers. No arrests have been made in last year's robberies, which included the following: - Oct. 3 , 10:16 p.m. A woman got money out of the ATM when a man approached her car, pointed a gun at her and took her money. He forced her to get more money from the ATM. - Nov. 8 , 11:44 p.m. A man was getting cash from the ATM when a man approached his car, pointed a gun at him and took his money and debit card. - Nov. 14 , 12:36 a.m. A woman was depositing a check at the ATM when a man approached her, pointed a gun and demanded money. - Nov. 28 , 11:55 p.m. As a man pulled up next to the ATM to withdraw cash, a man came from behind his car, pointed a gun and demanded money. The suspect took cash and ran. Coghill said detectives have followed up on several leads, "but nothing has panned out.' He praised the bank for its cooperation with police and for enhancing security by improving lighting and trimming nearby bushes. He said the bank's camera is now producing better photos, which may help police identify the most recent robber and others in the future. The suspect in the Feb. 9 robbery is described as a black man in his late 20s or early 30s with a large build. He was wearing a dark jacket, a black hoodie and a white scarf covering the lower part of his face. Anyone with information about the robberies is asked to call Coghill at (919) 560-4583, ext. 230, or CrimeStoppers at (919) 683-1200. CrimeStoppers pays cash rewards for information leading to arrests in felony cases, and callers never have to identify themselves.
