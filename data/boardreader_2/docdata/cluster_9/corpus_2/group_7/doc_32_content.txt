if my understanding is true...basically we HAVE to sign Marion this summer in order for my theory of only gaining 2 mill in cap space to be incorrect.  having said that...does this not give Marion all the leverage in the world to negotiate a big contract this year??  if he demands more than we want to pay him, what are we to do??  then we're seriously F*CKED no?  that means we have no capspace for really anyone worthwhile this summer even if we renounce everyone.  at best we could possibly buy someone for 8 or 9 mill and fill out the rest of the roster on league min contracts.  we know gordon prolly won't sign for 8 mill, and we've seen the pathetic FA crop this offseason, so other than trading, we'd be kind of F'd in the A.    ..again i might be missing something since this CBA stuff is so complex.
