Loyalty works both ways and  the cap hinders the team owners . If you are already paying your loyal QB $20 million, OT $10 million, DE $15 million, WR $10 million, and CB $10 million what do you tell your star LB when he suddenly wants $12 million and you already have $65 miilionin salaries for 5 players and still have to field a team of 53 players with a $123 million cap You tag him for $7 million and start looking for a replacement.     The team owners that I worry about without a cap could destroy the sport. This could turn out like MLB where the deep pocket owners ( The George) buyall the talent and leave those with less little chance of competing.      Message Edited by bostbest on  02-22-2009   01:48 PM     If there is going to be a salary cap for the team owners, then there should be a salary cap for the players. At this point the players are becoming overly greedy        The cap's worth (in my opinion) is to control both of their greed. If the owners can't give it, andcollectively use their common sense,the players can't get it (collusion is almost impossible to prove).Our big market team (once again, in my opinion) is doing it's best to control the situation by allowing players to leave. The problem is that there is alwaysother owner's willing to screw-up their team by giving them what they want.
