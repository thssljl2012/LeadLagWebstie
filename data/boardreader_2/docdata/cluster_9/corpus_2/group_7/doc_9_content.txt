I'm not going to open a new CitiBank account because the Mets play at their stadium. In fact, I think more fans would be annoyed that their team's stadium is a corporate joke and would boycott that company.     Take if from a huge baseball fan. There is only one type of corporate branding that we find socially acceptable for a stadium: beer.  The old Busch Stadium in St. Louis? Miller Park? Coors Field? As a beer and hotdog are still standard fare at a ballgame, most baseball fans kind of like it.   (That might be old fashioned but it is classic. Hence the retro architecture of new stadiums.)  Bank One Ballpark? Citi Field? Those are embarassing because it sounds too corporate.  Now, we are not so naive as to believe the beer is not made by corporations, but the nomenclature still counts for something.  Btw, the two choices for Mets fans would've been either calling the new park Shea Stadium again (after William Shea, the man who brought NY the Mets) or Metropolitain Stadium (no need to explain).  As it stands, most NYers are happy with its given name: Debits Field.
