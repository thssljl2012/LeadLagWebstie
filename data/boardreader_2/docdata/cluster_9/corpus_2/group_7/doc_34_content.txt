I made a similar post in another thread, but I wholeheartedly agree with everyone on this.  A salary cap in the NFL is a must. Since the advent of the cap, the NFL has seen tremendous parity in the league and it seems that any team can emerge at any time and become a competitor.        God forbid it becomes MLB, where the Yankees can get away with having a team salary a hair short of 10 times the salary of the lowest-salaried team in the league, the Marlins ($209MM vs. $21.8MM).        Fun fact- in 2008, if you add up the salaries of the Top 10 highest-paid Pirates (a.k.a. the ONLY ones making over $1MM/yr.), it would be just enough to pay for A-Rod and Johnny Damon.
