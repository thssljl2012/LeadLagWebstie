               Quote:                     Originally Posted by  Coachnorm         The Broncos have been cutting defensive players and RBs lately and have saved some serious cap money in the process. D.J Williams and the Broncos got together and came up with a restructured contract.     Now this smooth move by both the Broncos and Williams. Williams was due a big roster bonus soon, making Williams a big cap hit this year. Williams consented to have his roster bonus converted to a guaranteed signing bonus. This allows Williams to get the same money(guaranteed). But the Broncos now get to spread the money out over the entire contract cap wise. Savings on this years cap $3.6 million, nicely done, by both parties.                      I thought teams were not allowed to defer any cap $$ into the non-cap years of the CBA anymore ??
