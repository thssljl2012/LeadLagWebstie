      And another thing. This year the New York Mets Opening Day is actually a night game. On a Monday night. I'm sure it'll be the ESPN game of the week and not start until 8:30 or some crap like that, even though it is scheduled for 7:10. I just think its wrong. So wrong.  And don't get me started on Citibank accepting government bailout money and still paying 400 million in naming rights for the stadium.
