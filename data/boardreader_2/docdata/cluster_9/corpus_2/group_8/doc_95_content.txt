 My thoughts:      Keep the cap, alter the Luxury Tax:   LT remains 125% of the cap, but there is a "forgiveness" zone in the first 4% (one year only, not applicable if the second consecutive year above the tax line)(as in: Cap is $60M, LT is $75M, Forgiveness line if at $78M or less).     Only teams below the tax share in the luxury tax revenue ("forgiveness" teams don't pay tax but do not share in revenue)   Double Luxury Tax ($2 per $1 over) at and above 140% of cap ($84M with a $60M cap).  A team at $90M would pay $9M in LT + $12M in 2LT for a total of $21M (today it would be $15M).    The Luxury Tax is a great thing - it keeps almost everyone's payroll under control, and it is a solid form of revenue sharing that protects small markets like Milwaukee.        Make the MLE skip years and the LLE annual.     Swap their frequencies - the MLE has been the primary source of bad contracts since the last CBA (Juwan Howard, Mike James, etc).  Dropping the MLE to a max of 3 or 4 years would also be a good idea.      Stem the raises.     10% raises in max deals is way too much.  Even when the economy is going strong, inflation is well below that.  6% raises on max contracts (own team) to 4% (sign with new team).  10% raises on rookie deals (think about the kids).  5% on everything else.      Lemon Law.   Team out options after 2 years into 5+ year contracts.  If exercised, team will buy out the rest of the contract for 30% of the money due on the third year.  Exercising the option removes the cap implications after the following (third) year, similar to a medical retirement.  This should make a big dent in the common problem of guys playing out of their minds to earn a huge deal, only to show up to camp out of shape or disclose that they really needed microfracture surgery immediately after signing.
