 I am not sure if he can come back due to the salary cap. Since Sykora's cap hit is smaller than his I am not sure if they have enough space. The only time the cap hit would not effect it is if Sykora is out at least 10 games per the CBA:   "Clubs are not permitted to exceed the mamximum or drop below the minimum. But a team can exceed the cap to replace a player with a long-term injury (a minimum of 24 days and 10 games). When the injured player is reactivated, the team must get back under the cap. "   Also he would have to enter re-entry waivers to come back to the club, even though I doubt it but a club might make an offer on him at half the price and I think they are keeping the space they have left in the case Boucher comes back if not they would have to waive player(s) just as the Flyers had to do when Briere was reactivated.
