  Also, I think I remember seeing that we wouldn't actually be saving any money cutting him this year. If they designate him a June 1st cut after the draft, he will save on this year's cap next year, it will see some dead money though.   With the CBAexpiring there are no "June 1st" cuts this year. If we cut him we take theentire cap hit in 2009.
