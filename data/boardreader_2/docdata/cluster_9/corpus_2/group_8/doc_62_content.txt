WOOO GO FLAMES GO     You obviously don't understand the logistics of anything, being out west and all, I'll let it slide.  Olaf is obviously out for the year, so is Heward.  The other guys they picked up in that trade (Rodgers &amp; a 4th) are what the deal is all about.  So basically the leafs gave up a nothing prospect (and I mean nothing) in exchange for a 4th and lackluster prospect.  The total cap hit the leafs took for this is somewhere around $500,000.  So basically they paid that for the pick (which they desperately need) and a former first round pick (rodgers).  Pretty smart move if you ask me; because you can't exchange $ for players/picks anymore because of the CBA, so Burkie did the next best thing, pick up part of Tbays salary for a draft/player.    As for Gerber, he is taking over for the #1 (Toskala) because he is out for the year (as of this morning).  He is a rental in order to take the weight of CuJo who doesn't need to burden the remaining games (especially at his age); and if Gerber works out to be a good back up then so be it.
