 I know I'm supposed to be clicking a button, but this is a tough poll.      Jason Taylor - seems to be in every thread, and I'm not entirely sure why.   does he really still have it and is he actually worth 4-5m?      a wide receiver - I think the 4-5m wr's are gone.   who's left that's under the age of 40?      extend Wilfork - I would definitely put in a vote for wilfork, but w/the way they've got everybody's contract expiring this year, and w/the possible uncapped year and new cba approacing I have no idea whether or not that's a priority for them right now, or if it's better business to wait on that.      sign two mid-level players - maybe this is all that's left to vote for, but I'm not really sure which 2m player is out there that'd I'd be excited to vote for, and I expect they'll be signing a few more small money guys anyway, whether I vote for them or not.
