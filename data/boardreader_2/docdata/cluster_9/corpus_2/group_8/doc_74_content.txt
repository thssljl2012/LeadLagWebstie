       The price has gone up because the salary cap has increased each year.       Not quite. The price goes up because of supply and demand. The NFL (and any business) will charge whatever the fans will pay! If people don't go to the games or are unwilling to pay $9/beer then the prices will drop. Unfortunately - hardly anyone ever carries through with these threats to boycott games, etc.  No the price has gone up because the salary cap has went up. According to the CBA, while there is a cap, there is also a floor. I'm not saying that your totally wrong but as the cap increases, so does the floor and so do the demands of the workers.     It's not Snyder who drives the prices of players up. He is a very good businessman and he would like to see players come by cheaper. As long as he sees a return on investment, through ticket prices and merchandising, he will continue to pay.
