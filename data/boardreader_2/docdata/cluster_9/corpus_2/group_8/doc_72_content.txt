        QUOTE (stuckincincy &#064; Mar 6 2009, 06:33 AM)       CIN put in contract language after Carl Picken's antics several years ago - return of signing bonus and cancellation of contract for actions "detrimental to the team".   They invoked the clause once - punter Lee Johnson made some comments about lousy coaching or some such. Which was a pretty weak reason for canning him, IMO.  Nevertheless,  the NFLPA demanded that such contract clauses be eliminated - and they were with the new CBA.      I'd be surprized if it's not 'revisited' with the new CBA.
