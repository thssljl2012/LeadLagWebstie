He will be a RFA next year.  That means a team will have to give up a first and third to get him assuming that the Chiefs don't match the deal.  If there is a new CBA, the Chiefs still can franchise Cassel.      Besides, if he proves not to be a one year wonder, Pioli may be willing to give Cassel far more money than he is willing to give him now.  He will know for sure that he has a legitimate franchise QB.     Pioli will probably get a deal done with Cassel, but I don't think it is a slam dunk.  I was ridiculed when I suggested a team would trade for Cassel without a long term deal in place and I was right. So I may be right here.
