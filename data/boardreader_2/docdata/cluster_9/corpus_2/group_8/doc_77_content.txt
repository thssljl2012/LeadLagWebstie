So, he instead probably becomes a RFA and we have to hope another doesn't inflate his salary.                      Actually, I think that by that odd quirk of the rules, McFadden would go from being a FA this year to a RFA next year,  IF  we could keep him and sign him to a one-year deal. So I don't think he (or especially his agent) would want to let that happen. Although his options do seem to be narrowing.      I also think the RFA tag would apply to Miller and Holmes. Although if some moron offers Miller $10 million a year and Homles $15 million, I don't think we could match that, nor should we. Yeah, we'd get draft picks for them, but big whoop, since we would've lost two former first-rounders anyway. I just see a bigger danger of someone trying to swoop in and take Miller or Holmes because you can make the case that they're "special" or "best available at position" players. Regardless of what McFadden does, I don't think there'll be anything by end of next year to separate him from half a dozen other decent cornerbacks who hit the market, and most of htem will probably have more starting experience.                                              __________________       "An empty victory is a victory nonetheless."
