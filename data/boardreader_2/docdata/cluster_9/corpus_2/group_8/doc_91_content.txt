If the players want MLB guaranteed contracts, then they will need to hold out for that right in the next CBA negotiations (i.e. long lockout / strike).                       That would be bad for that to happen Joe. That's when greed would step in. And the high market clubs would be able to pick up and over pay the FA's. Ala NY Yankees.                      Of course it would be bad. Joe knows that.     Can players, under the current CBA, still ask of their franchise to guarantee the contract years? (ie, have it not be year to year)? Or is it simply not allowed no matter what? I doubt any team would do it anyway, but I'm just wondering if it's "allowed".     Anyway -- the players know how it works, and that's why they try to get that guaranteed amount.                                      __________________          NO   NEWS  ....
