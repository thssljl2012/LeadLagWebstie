   What I want to know is why we are on the hook for 17 against the cap when he is NOT a Panther player right now. Panthers just own rights.  That is the way theCBA isworded. By tagging a player, you are obligated tooffer the contract, and hence, whether he signs it or not, it counts on the cap. I     I know HOW it works. And I know how it is worded.   I am saying itSHOULD notwork that way.      It shouldnt work thatway 100% agreed. I hate saying this because I know all the other fans wont agree but I wish they wouldnt have tagged him.We need that cap money and Hurney expects 2 first round picks for a trade I believe and its not going to happen.Right now Im hoping for a second rounder and third just to get him  OFF  this roster.I believe that there are teams on his list that will give that up, but thequestion is will Hurney let him go for that price??? I bet not. I believe they think they can salvage this relationship with Pep.Tagging him might come back to bite them in the ***!!!!!!!!
