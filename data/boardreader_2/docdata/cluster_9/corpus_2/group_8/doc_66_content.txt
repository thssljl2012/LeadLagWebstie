If it's solely because we want something in return, I think that's dumb.  At this point I think everyone on here just wants the cap space.  Is there something in the rules or his contract that prevents him from being placed on waivers.     The NMC covers waiver moves as well.      What is your source for that?  I find that hard to believe.      The CBA.
