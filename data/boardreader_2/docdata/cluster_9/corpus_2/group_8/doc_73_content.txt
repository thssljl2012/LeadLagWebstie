        QUOTE (gruven &#064; Wednesday, March 4th, 2009, 3:33 PM)       The Kolzig deal is likely to get voided. You're not allowed to trade for cap space, so the two players being injured makes that a cap space deal. that alone might not be enough to get it voided but the deal puts tampa into line for an equalization payment by the league. So you can bet your ass that there will be a lot of screaming done.   Having players in there doesn't make it legal. You are NOT allowed under the CBA to use cap space as a trade asset, and that's CLEARLY what this trade is about..    Has this deal been approved yet?
