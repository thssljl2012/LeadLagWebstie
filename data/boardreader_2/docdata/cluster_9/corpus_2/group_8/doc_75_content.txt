   The cassel thing is a joke. It was a handout to Bellicheat's good buddy, Scott Pioloi. Peppers is worth more than one 2nd round pick. If they gave up #34 and #47 this year, NE would still have #23 and #58. We would get two 2nd round picks (givng us 3 total), and I think we should take it if NE offers.   Again, spot on. Cassels real value was exhibited in the Broncos three way deal. Astarting QB and some picks. NE correctly, does not want a high#1 pick. You have to pay too much. That is why the owners want to renegotiate the CBA. Rookies makeway toooo much. Itoo see a package of picks as opposed to a #1,unless we throughLucas in the deal. We dump some money and get the picks necessary to replace him. You do not replace Peppers in this draft.
