Something else to think about is the cap for   NEXT   year. Unless there is something going on that is not making the news, next year the cap will go to . . . . the sky. There will be no cap next year, so let's save as much cap room now as we can . . . . for what????      Whitehurst, if you actually get to talk to Murphy, maybe ask him why we are trying to save all this cap money when there will be no need for it next year.      And IMO, if 2010 make it here without a CBA, I see a lockout coming in 2011. A few like Jerry Jones, Daniel Snyder, Robert Kraft &amp; maybe a few others might vote against it, but I think most owners would vote for a lockout.      If the cap goes away and never comes back, my interest in the NFL will become less &amp; less.
