I have read and read and I cannot find out why this will "not CBA leagal" yet that is that I am told by some who are knowledgeable about the CBA.  Jerry Stackhouse's contract, according to shamsports, is:  $7.250 mil if we win a championship.  $3.625 mil if we don't win a championship and he is not waived by August 10th, 2009  $2.000 mil if we don't win a championship and we do waive him by then    I had made a post describing a similar type contract with Jason Kidd, but with a bigger % drop and with 2 non guaranteed years.  Something like this:  2009-10 $20 mil (all guaranteed) 2010-11 $20 mil (only 4 mil guaranteed if we fail to win a championship in '10) 2011-12 $20 mil (only 4 mil guaranteed if we fail to win a championship in '11)  The only responce I get is "it is not CBA-leagal"  Can anyone tell me why?
