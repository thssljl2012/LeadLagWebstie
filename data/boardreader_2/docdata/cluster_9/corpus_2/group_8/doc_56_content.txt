Connolly's agent wanted a 3 year deal, but the Sabres weren't willing to pay over &#036;4m per on the longer term.     I asked this in another thread and I don't think I got an answer....  In every other leagues, teams can put in "option" years for contracts.  Does the NHL CBA not allow for that type of thing?  It must because you never hear of it in hockey but I was wondering if anyone knew for sure.      Section 11.13 of the current CBA forbids option clauses/voidable years.      Thank you.  Thankyouverymuch.
