1) No, Wilfork would be an UFA.   2) Wilfork would be franchised if necessary, and again in 2011.   3) I don't think that we'd franchise Seymour.   4) I don't know the CBA deadline, but it should be in 2010.  Unless a new CBA is signed, 2010 is an uncapped year.

(example, high tender, low tender, etc.)   3) Assumption that similar to a franchise player he will have to receive at least 110% of current salary? which will be about $2.5M      If this is true we can franchise Seymour and extend Wilfork at the highest tender for about $14M.      4) When do we find out if 2010 is uncapped?
