      I think your understanding of the situation is spot on,  titanrick .          flash : The jump from $12M to $29M is not guaranteed, so they're not on the hook for that $29M, and they'll never pay it. But they DID guarantee the $41M, so we're going to have to see how much of that pay-out came up-front and will be spread out over the life of the contract. If they cut him, any unamortized (non-paid in terms of the salary cap) portions will be accelerated...this is the "dead cap" that people are talking about.        As I said before, it's a roll of the dice. They're taking their chances that A) Haynesworth will continue to play like a man-beast and B) There won't be a highly restrictive salary cap in place in 2014 or so. The first is for obvious reasons (it's a ton of money to pay a guy who sucks), and the second is so that they don't get swallowed up by dead cap. I think it's a pretty safe bet, though. If the CBA doesn't get renewed this year, I don't think there will BE a salary cap in 2014, and even if there is, I think the expanding profits of the league are going to continue to push the salary cap through the roof.        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Also,  Doc Einstein , I'm interested to get your thoughts on a concept I mentioned in a different thread. In my personal opinion, the Redskins were at a crossroads this particular offseason. They have a roster stocked with stars or borderline stars who are approaching the end of their prime. Guys like Portis, Samuels, Moss, Fletcher, Taylor, Thomas, and even Griffin are still good-to-excellent players RIGHT NOW, but their window is closing. I'd say almost all of those players will be past their prime or even finished in 3 years or so.         With that in mind, wouldn't you tend to agree that the Redskins were faced with a decision to either take a shot at building an elite team (go big) or blow it up and try to let these players go and essentially start over (go home)? Continuing to wallow in mediocrity with a good-but-not-great defense and an average-but-not-good offense seems to me to be a waste of such talented players.        I believe in building through the draft as well, but we were not going to get over the top in three years solely through that process. Playing it safe and executing a "slow build" would waste the talent currently on the team, and would have left us still with a number of holes to fill in 2-3 years. To me, the choice was either take a shot to build a contender or blow it up and start over. I'm pleased with the choice they made. _________________            Thanks to  Arem20  on the FF Pick 'Em Championship Sig
