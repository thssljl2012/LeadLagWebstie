^ No. In order to get the capspace, you have to renounce the rights of Rasheed and Iverson and without that sapce, cannot trade for a player like Chandler while sending out less money than you are taking back. If you renounce the rights to Sheed/Iverson, you can't sign and trade, because you wouldn't hold their rights and aren't allowed to go over the cap to re-sign them. Your scenario is not possible under the rules on the CBA.
