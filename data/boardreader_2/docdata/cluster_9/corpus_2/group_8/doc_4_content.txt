Where the problem lies has been when the Developmental players end up getting first teams minutes (sometimes significant amounts, a la Herculez Gomez) yet still get that low pay amount.  I imagine that is something that will be addressed in the next CBA...                      I think that you are saying that compared the salary of the Rod $ 20 mil to a rookie $ 120,000.00 in baseball, in MLS is acceptable that a rookie because the salary of the Sr. players is in the $ 100,000.00, $12,000.00 for the Dev. players is OK...      With $ 120,000.00 a kid can live pretty good life, but with $ 12,000.00 won't have enough to pay the rent or go out for fun or anything...I think that have to be a minimum for this kids, I will say no less than $ 25,000.00.....They are only four of them or $ 100,000.00 a year for the kids...
