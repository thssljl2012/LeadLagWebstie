I mean, this isn't like baseball where it's a matter of how much money the owner wants to spend, or even basketball where there's a "soft" limit and if you go over you have to pay a tax (at least I think that's how it works).     Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft may be raking in way more money than Spanos, but is that what is really keeping us from signing guys like Peppers? I mean, we're pretty close to the salary cap as it stands anyway, and generally have been in years past. It's not as if the salary cap has been around $100 million but we've only chosen to spend $35 of that each year or something...I guess I just don't understand what all the extra revenue from PSL's and luxury suites has to do with anything if we're spending up against the cap every year anyway.                      What is keeping the Spanos' from signing a Peppers?      Because their operational revenues are going towards extending PR, Merriman, McNeill, Cromartie, Gates, VJ and others. Signing Peppers means giving him Merriman's money - i.e. robbing Peter to pay Paul.     Not a single owner goes into his own wallet to pay their players. Despite one of the top 10 stadiums in stadium capacity and selling out all games since midseason 2004, the Chargers are in the bottom half-dozen teams in revenues.     As for the bonuses "eventually" catching up: that only happens when you make a habit of it - if you make it a habit, it forces you to "churn the roster" as we've seen happen to many teams (including the Cowboys and Redskins) as they are unable to pursue their own starters who they want to keep and/or they are forced to release starters under contract to get under the cap.      The Pats don't make a habit of signing UFAs to these kinds of contracts, so they aren't likely to be in a "cap hell" position.     When the cap doesn't increase at a good rate and the churning of the roster isn't enough to get you under the cap, you have reached cap hell. So long as the cap keeps increasing at a big rate each year, even teams like the Skins and Cowboys can avoid cap hell with their normal roster churning tactics.     The Skins lucked out in 2006. They were facing cap hell as the new CBA adoption deadline was reached and extended before the new CBA was adopted at the last second. They would have had to jettison a good portion of their roster if the cap hadn't gone upwards in 2006.
