This became an issue after Russian prospect  AlexeiCherepanov  died and the New York Rangers raised the issue with the league. If the NHLPA signs off on it, a team would receive a second round pick if one of their prospects dies before signing a contract with the NHL club"   I remember this topic heated up some argument about the justification, but remember that the CBA states the following on compensation for unsigned 1st rounders. Per the CBA:       A team that does not sign a first-round draft pick is awarded a compensatory pick in a future draft upon losing the rights to that player.         Im a little confused here ... youre sayingits in the cba but the tsn article says they need to ammend the cba ... do they just have to ammend it to define what number pick it what be   If the NHLPA signs off on it, a team would receive a second round pick if one of their prospects dies before signing a contract with the NHL club.      The compensation for Cherapanov falls under the current CBA which awards them the pick for him being an unsigned 1st-round pick.  However, since the circumstances are setting a precedent, they will create a new rule for all prospects who happen to pass away while under contract or not, I believe.  So fpor example if a 4th rounder of say the Sabres (just random, nothing personal) paaes away, the team would not get a compensatory pick under the current CBA because he wasn't a 1st rounder.  Under the new proposal, the sabres would get a compensatory pick, which i would guess would be one round after the round the deceased player was drafted.   And TooToo, I have no idea how they came at 47. i am guessing since Cherry was 17th overall in 2007, they would compensate with with the same draft position the player was taken only one round later.
