 Although it was an interesting read, the proposed idea is horribly flawed and many of those problems have been pointed out here.      I think the best idea is to have players' contracts based on the health of the league.  Let's say a player is making $5 mil a year.  If the overall NBA revenues increase 10% the next year, the player would be paid $5.5 million.  However, if they decreased 10%, he would be payed $4.5 million.      This would help to prevent the current problem of owners being locked into long-term contracts based on boom years, even as the league faces falling revenues.
