                                                                   That was his original NTC/NMC terms with LA.  He was traded before the clause vested, so the Oiler's shouldn't need to honor it.  According to the CBA (referencing nhlscap)     If the player is traded or claimed on Waivers prior to the no-Trade or no-move clause taking effect, the clause does not bind the acquiring Club.  An acquiring Club may agree to continue to be bound by the no-Trade or no-move clause, which agreement shall be evidenced in writing to the Player, Central Registry and the NHLPA, in accordance with Exhibit 3 hereof.
