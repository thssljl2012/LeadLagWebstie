The league is apparently investigating this trade.       Not only did Toronto essentially buy a 4th round pick (trading of cash is prohibited by the CBA) but I also believe this enables Tampa to somehow receive more compensation from the league revenue sharing.      I wouldn't be surprised if the deal got reversed, but there is that Rogers kid in there who is a former first round pick, and Petiot is at least a passable AHL player...so there is something there from a hockey standpoint.
