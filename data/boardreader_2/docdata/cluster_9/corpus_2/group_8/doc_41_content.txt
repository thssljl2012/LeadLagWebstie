  What I want to know is why we are on the hook for 17 against the cap when he is NOT a Panther player right now. Panthers just own rights.  That is the way theCBA isworded. By tagging a player, you are obligated tooffer the contract, and hence, whether he signs it or not, it counts on the cap. I     I know HOW it works. And I know how it is worded.   I am saying itSHOULD notwork that way.
