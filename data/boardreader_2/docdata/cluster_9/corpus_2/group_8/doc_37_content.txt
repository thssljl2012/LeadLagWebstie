Re the "throwing money" at a player: remember that next year ('10) is an uncapped year if there's no CBA. That would be a disaster for the owners in general but would do away with any cap issue. Also, if he retires after a year you don't owe him the second year's base salary. The thing is, O.J. was terrible when we signed him. He rushed for about 500 yards and no touchdowns his last year in Buffalo. Compare that to Warner's 96.9 QB rating, and you see it's a completely different situation. The issue isn't the level at which Warner is playing and will play for a few years (look at what Bruce did last year), but whether our scheme can even approach what is necessary to maximize his talent. Spending the money is foolish if all he's going to do is throw a few screen passes and hand off. But if we sign him, you can be sure of two things in the draft: we will draft either a tackle or receiver at #10, and we will draft at least one or both of the others later in the draft.
