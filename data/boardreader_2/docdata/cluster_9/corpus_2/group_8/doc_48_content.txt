        QUOTE (kota &#064; Mar 3 2009, 11:24 PM)       i am somewhat sick of people crying because the Bills are signing backups.  There are a ton of backups in the league who are stuck behind entrenched starting veterans and Pro Bowl players.  These so called backups could very well be starters on other teams and maybe eventual pro bowl players.  I personally like the signing of our new center, Drayton Florance and Fitzpatrick.  They aren't Albert Hayensworth type signs far from it but i am also glad we aren't the Redskins.  Dan Snyder is banking on there not being a CBA next year.  If he is wrong he will have to cut half his team to get under a salary CAP.  you don't get to SB's that way.  Please remember that James Harrison was cut 4 times and now look at him.  There are plenty of guys in the NFL looking for a opportunity.  Pat Thomas could be the next guy and for the money he will get it's a small gamble.     Football is a crap shoot when trying to predict who will make it as a star player.  Look at Jim Leanrard.  He was our left overs and he did well in Baltimore.  It is all about chemistry and coaching with some luck.
