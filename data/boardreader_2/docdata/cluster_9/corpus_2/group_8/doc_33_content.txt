 It's still possible that there will be a cap if the player's union ever names someone to head it. They are supposed to start working on the CBA as soon the new head of the player's union is announced. I think people are assuming too prematurely that there won't be a Salary cap. Of course who knows who Al Davis, Synder, and Jerry Jones have paid off to get rid of it.
