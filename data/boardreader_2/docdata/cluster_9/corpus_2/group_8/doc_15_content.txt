             QUOTE (Old Hawk &#064; Mar 1 2009, 12:53 PM)       A long term deal allows the Hawks to front load the contract, but the cap hit is averaged out over the length of the deal. He can retire at any time and the contract is off the books.    I'm quite sure that if a player retires,there is some sort of a cap hit.Especially if their 35 or over.  In the CBA,if a player is 35 or older and retires while under contract,the WHOLE contract left will be a cap hit.  I believe this was the case in the Oilers  trying to land Jagr.He wanted a 3 year deal.The Oilers said 2.Just in case he had a Jagr change of heart and retired!!!                               --------------------   If your not wasted,the day is!!!
