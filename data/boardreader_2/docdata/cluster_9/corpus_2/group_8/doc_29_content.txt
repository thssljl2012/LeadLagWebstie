It clears twenty million from the cap for NE and you don't really need the hit of having two franchise QBs on roster and they feel real good about Brady's rehab. They can spend that money on signing the five picks they have from they first round to the early part of the third round. The Chiefs were fifty million under the cap so they had no worries as far as the cap goes.     Exactly, Franchising Cassel made complete sense at the time.  They needed a few extra weeks/month to make sure Brady's recovery was going well.  Once they are happy with that, the 14 mil Cassel is getting could be better served with elsewhere. Also, had they not franchised him he would have been a FA.  So they franchise him in order to trade a FA for something and control where he goes.  All that said, it looks like Cassel is getting screwed to me.  Had NE not Franchised him at 14 Mil he would have been a freee agent.  I am curious what his market would have been?  I assume he on a one year deal with the Chiefs at 14?  I wonder if when the new CBA comes up after the uncapped year if it will still include a franchise clause.  It's a pretty sketchy move to force someone to play for your team even after their contract is over, even if they are paid the average of the top 5 at thier position.
