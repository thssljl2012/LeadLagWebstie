No wonder those guys are living 4-5 to a house.                      The amount reservists/developmental players in MLS make is not that out of line compared to the salaries of minor league baseball, ML hockey, and the NBA's D-League players, and those sports have a lot more money to spend on player development than MLS.  Where the problem lies has been when the Developmental players end up getting first teams minutes (sometimes significant amounts, a la Herculez Gomez) yet still get that low pay amount.  I imagine that is something that will be addressed in the next CBA...
