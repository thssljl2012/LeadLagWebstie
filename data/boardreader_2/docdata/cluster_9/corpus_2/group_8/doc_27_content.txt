I can understand those that believe Warner is a bad fit for the team considering the offensive personal the Niners have. I disagree, but that is what the board is for. Paying him 30 million over two years will not adversely affect our salary cap. That line of argument is pointless. The Niners are well under the cap this year, and next year there is no cap. Whenever a new CBA is agreed upon, that will not change next year.
