Over TT's time in Green Bay he has taken this team from cap hell to 30mil over the right way. It's a shame that the Jones/Snyder's of the NFL will be able to clean up their cap issues next year with the no cap! The no-cap year will help many teams next year and sadly the Packers are at the very tail end of that list.        If you look at the contract numbers the Vikes should also see some future light if they want to play with their deals and get future money of the table next year. It's life but damn it sucks!             The only way to "fix" the problem is to cut guys.  Can't restructure it away.  The Deion rule and 30% rule apply, a guaranteed roster bonus is considered a 1 year signing bonus in the eyes of the CBA (hence the Deion rule), and it can't be converted to salary (via the 30% rule).        The only way to do it would be to cut them first, tear up the old contract, and start anew.        Provisions are in place to prevent this exact problem from happening.             I feel your point but  I would bet more than a few players would do this if the same "true money" was on the table  and it would help the team get a ring down the road. Again Waldo, that was a VERY good point!             And  more than a few wouldn't .  And I would expect all would want to be compensated for their generosity.  Remember, to do this would take a lot of liquid capitol (even if an owner is a billionaire, doesn't mean he can go take 200M out of an ATM), and you would be in essence giving guys more guaranteed money by "fixing" the problem.  All those dummy years that are supposed to inflate contract #'s, the players would expect to get paid.  After all that is what was agreed to.             I agree, it's not as if I think some teams will go from 30mil over too 30mil under. I just think a few teams that would have had a "clean house" may not now and that TT's hard work may go without notice also. _________________
