He was traded before the clause vested, so the Oiler's shouldn't need to honor it.  According to the CBA (referencing nhlscap)      If the player is traded or claimed on Waivers prior to the no-Trade or no-move clause taking effect, the clause does not bind the acquiring Club.   An acquiring Club may agree to continue to be bound by the no-Trade or no-move clause, which agreement shall be evidenced in writing to the Player, Central Registry and the NHLPA, in accordance with Exhibit 3 hereof .      Here's the local source:   http://communities.canada.com/edmontonjournal/blogs/hockey/archive/2008/07/02/visnovsky-has-a-one-year-no-trade-clause-that-s-it.aspx      It sounds like the Organization gave him a one year NTC as a nice gesture.    I replied/answered to this before &amp; if you look at clause in that section (&amp; a further section)  of the CBA,  (the underlined part) a player or Club (which many do) can also have a clause written into their SPC that can change the terms or exempts their NMC/NTC's from being voided by any Club that trades for that player in the future. (vested or not)     That Scribe was penned a day after the deal was made &amp; does seem to have some grey area to it, while in the meantime, I'm also pretty sure that I've heard Rick Olczyk (Assistant GM/ Director of Hockey Operations &amp; Legal Affairs &amp; who handles all the Oilers CBA issues) state the L.V.'s NMC was honored when they made the deal due to the wording/clause in his SPC.    There is no such thing as giving a player a NTC/NMC deal as a nice gesture. It's either in his deal or it's not. Clubs cannot renegotiate $$$ or the terms of any SPC's after they have been ratified by the league. So the Oilers could not "add" a clause to his SPC at anytime during the length of the deal unless his SPC states as such.    I'm going to ask &amp; try &amp; get the final word on this (if possible) so we can put this issue to bed once &amp; for all. Because, LV either has his NMC or he does not, there is not in-between on this. Hopefully I'll have some info soon..?    xxx6x
