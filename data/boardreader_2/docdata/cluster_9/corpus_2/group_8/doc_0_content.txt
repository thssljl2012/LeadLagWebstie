          Guaranteed can mean alot of stuff, but if its 5 mil in signing bonus it would be a very bad move to cut him after 1 year. We would still have to pay 4 mil to him and that would go on our cap, well if there is one.            On a side note, they better get a new CBA together the cap is what makes the NFL so great. _________________         "The Wrecking Ball" Leonard Weaver
