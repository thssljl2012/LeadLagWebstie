Add up all the salaries and signing bonuses this year and give us the figure.  It will be over the cap because of Al's deferred money.  That doesn't mean they are in violation of cap rules; it means they are deferring immediate money to the future.  But that money doesn't magically go away, as I've been told by some Skins fans.  It's simple math and contracts like Al's - big money signing bonuses and more years than they can reasonably expect to play - will hurt you eventually.  Snyder has not found some magic way to get around the cap.        e16bball also understands how it all works.  If you get 3-4 years out of Haynesworth and don't make these enormous signing bonuses a trend, it might work out alright.  But more of these types of deals will kill you in the future.  Just pray that Al's knees don't give out in the next two years or he has an anger-management lapse or he quits trying as hard because of the $41M in guarantees.             yes but the 5th year jump from 12 million to 30 million is unguaranteed correct? So if big Al makes it to the 5th year the redskins can restructure him and offer him another huge signing bonus with another back loaded contract  or cut him out right without any cap ramifications.  This is why the deal is essentially 4 years 48 million which isn't a huge overpayment for Haynesworth. The real risk in the situation is that Haynesworth will bust or get injured before that 4 year ends which is a risk I would be willing to make to improve the team the way haynesworth can.             That doesn't sound right to me.  Was all the guaranteed money in the form of roster bonuses with none of it deferred?  I thought signing bonuses were deferred over the life of the entire contract even if a "poison pill" (not really the correct use of the term here) is in place making it a virtual certainty that the player won't see his final year's salary.  So if the $41M was all in a signing bonus, it would count $5.86M against the cap each year of the deal.  So if they cut him after four years, the final three years - or $17.6M would all count toward that year's cap.  Possibly that year and the next, but you get the point.        I still haven't seen any specifics yet.  I don't think all $41M will be a signing bonus so we're shooting in the dark, trying to figure out how bad it will be if they have to cut him in the next two years.             I think your understanding of the situation is spot on,  titanrick .          flash : The jump from $12M to $29M is not guaranteed, so they're not on the hook for that $29M, and they'll never pay it. But they DID guarantee the $41M, so we're going to have to see how much of that pay-out came up-front and will be spread out over the life of the contract. If they cut him, any unamortized (non-paid in terms of the salary cap) portions will be accelerated...this is the "dead cap" that people are talking about.        As I said before, it's a roll of the dice. They're taking their chances that A) Haynesworth will continue to play like a man-beast and B) There won't be a highly restrictive salary cap in place in 2014 or so. The first is for obvious reasons (it's a ton of money to pay a guy who sucks), and the second is so that they don't get swallowed up by dead cap. I think it's a pretty safe bet, though. If the CBA doesn't get renewed this year, I don't think there will BE a salary cap in 2014, and even if there is, I think the expanding profits of the league are going to continue to push the salary cap through the roof.        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Also,  Doc Einstein , I'm interested to get your thoughts on a concept I mentioned in a different thread. In my personal opinion, the Redskins were at a crossroads this particular offseason. They have a roster stocked with stars or borderline stars who are approaching the end of their prime. Guys like Portis, Samuels, Moss, Fletcher, Taylor, Thomas, and even Griffin are still good-to-excellent players RIGHT NOW, but their window is closing. I'd say almost all of those players will be past their prime or even finished in 3 years or so.         With that in mind, wouldn't you tend to agree that the Redskins were faced with a decision to either take a shot at building an elite team (go big) or blow it up and try to let these players go and essentially start over (go home)? Continuing to wallow in mediocrity with a good-but-not-great defense and an average-but-not-good offense seems to me to be a waste of such talented players.        I believe in building through the draft as well, but we were not going to get over the top in three years solely through that process. Playing it safe and executing a "slow build" would waste the talent currently on the team, and would have left us still with a number of holes to fill in 2-3 years. To me, the choice was either take a shot to build a contender or blow it up and start over. I'm pleased with the choice they made. _________________            Thanks to  Arem20  on the FF Pick 'Em Championship Sig
