Also, I think the reduction of guaranteed contracts is the last thing you'll see in the new CBA. Guaranteed contracts is something the Players Association is really serious about, and rightfully so. I think it's one of the main things they won't budge on.  Maybe they'll just reduce the maximum contract length to five years, if anything. But all of that will be guaranteed, I think.  Really, there's no need for any of this. It's on the GMs. Why should it be written into the CBA that GMs can't make the kinds of offers that they do? Players aren't putting guns to anyone's heads. I always think that you get what your worth.   Basically, it's forcing Stern to control the GMs. I think GMs making bad decisions is just a part of basketball, and what makes it fun. Sometimes things turn out great, sometimes they don't. If anything, maybe we should write a "if your team sucks ass for three straight years, the GM must be fired" provision into the CBA. That'd solve all problems.  As for contract lengths, if a GM feels a player is worth signing for six years, even though they'll probably only get four good years out of him, why stop him? He always has the option of not signing him for that long, though he runs the risk of someone else signing him for that long. Like I said, you get what you're worth.  I've never looked at contracts of great length at face value, especially for older players. So say Jason Kidd gets a 6 year contract at age 29, for $140 million (I'm making up the numbers, because I don't know them exactly). I basically just look at it as you're paying him $35 mil for 4 good years. I think that's how a lot of GMs look at it, and how fans should look at it. In that case, it actually makes sense, and it looks less like a bad deal.
