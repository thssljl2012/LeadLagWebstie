When heading into a last capped year, signing bonuses can only be pro-rated over five years of a contract.  Therefore, cutting Scott after 2013 would result in no acceleration of his signing bonus onto our cap, assuming the cap is reinstated. I guess the only way it could result in dead money is if part of the guaranteed dollars come in some form of roster bonus or guaranteed salary that last year (2014), which probably isn't likely at all.  The same exact thing occurred with Bryan Thomas' 5-year contract extension. Since it was made during 2006 with 2007 scheduled to be an uncapped year and bonuses are pro-rated starting with the league year they're awarded, the bonus was pro-rated from 2006 to 2010, and he has a base salary of $5.3 M in 2011 of which we realize a FULL cap savings by cutting him.   So, if there is a cap, we almost assuredly have ZERO cap responsibilities regarding Scott in 2014 (year six of his deal). Whenever we get the details of that contract, you can reduce his 2014 base salary from the total value, reduce the contract by a year, and get the real contract. If the salary is in excess of $8 M, his contract is actually CHEAPER than the originally reported 5 yr, $40 M deal.    Note: when Thomas signed his deal, the league and union had agreed early in the year to a new CBA to prevent the 2007 uncapped year, but, since deals had already been signed, they kept the five-year rule in place.
