Is it possible to give a player (ie Rubio) the MLE with a contract similar to Kapono? If you look at it, going number 2 or 3, salaries range from 4.3M-3.8M to 6.2M-5.6M, respectively. If the MLE is projected to be 5.5M starting, economically wouldn't it be wise (more security) for a player (Rubio), to take the offer of the MLE from a team? I'm not too familiar with the rules of the CBA, so any info would be much appreciated. Thanks.
