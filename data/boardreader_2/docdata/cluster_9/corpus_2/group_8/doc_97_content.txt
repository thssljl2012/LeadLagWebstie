I'm sure I could look it up given some time but thought it possible some of you guys might know more less ballpark numbers right off the top of your head.                         The roster size for an MLS team is 20 players and the salary cap I believe is 2.1 million.     You have developmental players making as low as 12,900 and you have others make 400K-500K     They also have the designated player rule that allows each team to sign up to one player that will not count against the cap which is where players like Beckham, Blanco, Ljundberg fall in.     The CBA is up in 2010 and we will likely see an increase in the cap and salaries.
