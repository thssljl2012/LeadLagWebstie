The Pats dumped $14 mil in salary on a guy with a very limited track record, and got a high second round pick for him, and the Chiefs didn't give up multiple high round picks for him so if he turns out to not work out at least it would only be like one busted pick, and if he does end up being a very good QB in the NFL they have their QB of the future.               2/3 of the earth is covered by water.  The other third is covered by Ed Reed.        I think Marriotti was complaing that the Pats just gave away Cassel/Vrabel.         He is feeling to take into consideration the fact that in a deep draft that 34th pick should bring in a valuable player, or that the $17 million in cap relief the Pats get is huge.        They could have done the same thing by not tagging Cassell and cutting Vrable.    This might come as a suprise to some, but if BB gave Pioli a going away/housewarming gift in this deal, so what? He can trade whoever he wants, to whoever he wants, for whatever he wants.    I do think this spells the end of the franchise/transition tag. It was clearly abused in this case, and if the owners want the player pool of money reduced in the new CBA, they're going to have to give something back.    Ironic thing is that the NFLPA executive commitee member, Vrable, who's been the most vocal about getting rid of the tag is involved with the deal that will probably do it.                     undefined
