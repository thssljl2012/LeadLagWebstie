Next year is theoretically uncapped so the "lesser" FAs think they should be able to get better deals next year, especially after a year with a good team.             I wonder if the players realize that an uncapped year means a year with no spending minimum either.  It was the owners who opted out of the current CBA, why, so they could spend MORE money? _________________           Sheldon Brown on his hit on Reggie Bush wrote:           It was like running through a cardboard box.
