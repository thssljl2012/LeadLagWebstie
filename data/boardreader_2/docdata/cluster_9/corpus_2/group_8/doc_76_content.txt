It's some of the other guys I worry about -- Harrison, Holmes, Miller. Seems like there are enough cornerbacks changing hands every year that a normal market value establishes itself, but all it takes is one f*cktard owner to throw ridiculous money at a player to ruin your chance of re-signing him, and that definitely seems more likely with the other three.                         If I am not mistaken Miller will not become a FA if there is no new CBA (years of service to become a FA go from 4 to 6 without a new CBA). So, he instead probably becomes a RFA and we have to hope another doesn't inflate his salary.
