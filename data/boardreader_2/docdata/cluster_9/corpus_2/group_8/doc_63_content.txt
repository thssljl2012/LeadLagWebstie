A cap is a necissity and not having one nearly ruins the MLB (but being a boring game finishes it off). I don't even want an uncapped year. They really need to get a CBA done and the death of Upshaw really hurt us in achieving said goal IMO.        BTW- I really appreciate it when you break down contracts Juggs. No idea where you get your 411, but it puts me at ease with some of these signings.        I also think that as long as Cole plays up to his middle-of-the-road contract they might let him see it out. That last year isn't too unreasonable in comparison to the rest of the contract as long as he's still playing decent.             He could see 2012 and 2013 if we really like him, I just think that is where a big bump in sal is and with him being 32 in 2012 looks like a point that they all most plan on letting him go.        year_______sal______roster bonus______sign bonus_____total    2012_______4.45________0.0_____________.5_________4.95     2013_______5.00________0.0_____________.5_________5.50 _________________         "The Wrecking Ball" Leonard Weaver
