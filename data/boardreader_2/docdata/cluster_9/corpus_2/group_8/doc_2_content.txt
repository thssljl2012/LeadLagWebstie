If you remember the McDyess trade, the trade was agreed to before the draft, then Nene was selected by the Knicks (for Denver) and put on the Knicks hat to take his picture with Stern and the trade was completed the next day.     Yea, you don't even need to wait until the next day. The key to understanding this concept is that you only draft the RIGHTS to a player. Once you draft the rights, you have a period of time where you negotiate a contract with the player. Of course, because of the CBA this range of salaries for the player is fixed and most teams just give their rookie the maximum (125% of the scale for their position in the draft). But once you pick the player, it is no longer a future draft pick, it is just rights to a player with no contract.
