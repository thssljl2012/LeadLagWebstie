  Yeah, but a salary cap that low means the max FA would have to take a pay-cut to leave his team. He'd be better off extending this summer or just taking his player option in 2010-2011    I could be wrong as I am not a CBA expert but I am pretty sure that they are guaranteed to get a contract that is 105% of their previous contract for a max, regardless of the 30% salary cap rule, so while they might not get much more than their previous contracts, they wouldn't lose money by signing a new max deal.
