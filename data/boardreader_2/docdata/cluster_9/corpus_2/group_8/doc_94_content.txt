If the players want MLB guaranteed contracts, then they will need to hold out for that right in the next CBA negotiations (i.e. long lockout / strike).                         Exactly...  They can just strike.  What is the point of any contracts anymore.  The Chargers thought they were geniues for locking up LT when hew was claming rushing crowns in back-to-back years.  Meanwhile bums like Larry Johnson were getting paid more than LT.  After a year full of injuries (that's right...1 year month-to-month) now they want to get out of that contract.  Why would LT give an ounce of support to the Chargers after they burned three of his best friends:      1) Brees   2) Shottenheimer   3) Turner      No wonder there is no loyatly in the NFL anymore.  It all starts upstairs with the management.  Don't hate the players for reciprocating it back to the teams that keep screwing them over.
