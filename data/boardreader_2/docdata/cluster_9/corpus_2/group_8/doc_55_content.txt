What the heck is Burke thinking of?                         this is how the trade breaks down, Kolzig had $300,000 left on contract, Heward had $100,000 left on his. Rogers and Petiot are both minor leaguers whose salaries don't count. The leafs agreed to take the contracts of TBL ($400,000) remaining in exchange for TBL's 4th round pick. Toronto wins cause they get a pick in the draft, Kolzig and Heward are UFA's, so no contract going forward. TBL sheds money that they now don't have to pay, and possibly qualify for more revenue sharing money cause which is helped by a lower cap. The leafs have TONS of room under the cap, so its no big deal for them.    Burke is the ultimate at finding the loopholes in the CBA, he used to help write them I believe. By sending a minor-leaguer back to TBL, Burke effectively 'bought' a draft pick. Its clear to everybody including the NHL I am sure, but because there IS a loophole, he is 'technically' abiding by the rules, good for him!!
