Then why waste our time studying the nuances of these meaningless contracts?     The fact of the matter is...until something becomes reality in the NFL. It is all just fantasy. I don't trust anything that comes out of any of these guys mouths.                      You're wrong about the CBA. That determines how everything in the NFL is operated, including player contracts that are year-to-year.     If the players want MLB guaranteed contracts, then they will need to hold out for that right in the next CBA negotiations (i.e. long lockout / strike).                                      __________________                You want analysis?
