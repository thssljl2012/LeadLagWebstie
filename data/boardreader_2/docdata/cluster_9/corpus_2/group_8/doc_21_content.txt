Thanks for that clarification.  Yeah, I'm not worried about Stack's future. It was my "similar contract" idea for Kidd.  It would make no sense if we decide to keep him and the 20 mil happens all 3 years.  That would just be dumb.    So, I see that he meant by "not CBA-legal".  I was under the assumption Stack could play the entire year for $3.625 mil if we did not win a chip this year and similarly, I was using the $4 mil for Kidd.  It all makes tons of sense now.  I appreciate your help here.
