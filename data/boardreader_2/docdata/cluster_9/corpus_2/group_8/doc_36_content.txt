Stack's contract didn't drop. In fact it's going UP from $7M to $7.25M. The contract as written must be within 10.5% each yr.     No team's gonna write a deal like you proposed, because it won't work like you want it to, if it's CBA-legal.     Guarantees are a different issue than contract amounts and don't create a window to solve the problem.They don't drop the size of the contract itself, so if he is still on your team he's going to get paid the full amount whether it was originally guaranteed or not. Bonuses are a completely different issue as well, and not really a mechanism to reliably shift massive payroll from one year to another.     When all is said and done, the issue will be pretty simple and there's not a fancy workaround. The Mavs will have to sign Kidd to a one-year deal and then do a brand new deal in 2010, or sign him to a multi-year that spans 2010 and try to make the numbers fit their plan while being satisfactory to Kidd. Or let him go.
