 Sounds reasonable. I haven't been keeping up but is it a lock that next year is uncapped or is that still to be determined?  It's still to be determined. If the CBA isn't extended by FA next year it will be uncapped. We went through the same thing in 2006 and they delayed the start of FA to take care of it. The general belief is that if 2010 is uncapped, the salary cap is gone forever.
