        QUOTE (Doggy &#064; March 4, 2009 &#045; 11:40AM)       *sigh*  It's staggering how much this is misunderstood.  From the CBA:  All Player Salary and Bonuses paid to Players on an NHL Active Roster, Injured Reserve or Non Roster that are Unfit to Play  being either injured or suffering from an illness  shall be counted against a Club's Upper Limit, Actual Club Salary and Averaged Club Salary, as well as against the Players' Share.      Well then how, pray tell, did the Wings manage to bring up Leino, Ericsson, Helm, etc. when Stuart went down?  They basically said "we are saving cap space" with the injuries and they brought them up.
