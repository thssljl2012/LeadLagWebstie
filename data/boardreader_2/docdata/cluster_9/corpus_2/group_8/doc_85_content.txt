It's sad that Roy Williams has such little value on the open market that he cant even be traded for a 4th or 5th round pick. He is the Cowboys version of Josh Howard, a couple of years ago Roy might have gotten you a 2nd or 3rd rd pick but they held on to him for too long and now are getting nothing for him. The same could happen with Josh although the NBA's CBA is alot different than the NFL's so Josh's expiring contract next year will still give him value.     I like Kitna for Henry, Mike Jenkins and Orlando Scandrick are ready to go IMO. Both are blue chippers. But, if Newman goes down again, they will have nothing behind those 3. Jon Kitna was an outstanding backup for Carson Palmer in Cincy and I expect him to be similar here. I dont think it is anything Romo has to worry about, Dallas just wanted a real backup QB to avoid what happened last year.
