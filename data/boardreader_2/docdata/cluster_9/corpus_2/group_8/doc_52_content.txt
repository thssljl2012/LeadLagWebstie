Oh, and the other big revenue source, advertising, figures to be way down too.      Simmons also addresses the expectation that there will be a huge battle after this CBA runs out. It ain't working for the owners. They need a shorter contract limit, some way to adjust salary (and cap space) when players are injured, sulking or just plain underperform, and they're going to want to  raise , the max salary limit above the current 1/3 of the cap limit.       That last seems insane, from a basketball viewpoint, but probably makes sense from a marketing perspective. So we can expect MORE "star calls" from the refs and an even GREATER and even more slavish commitment to showing only the highlights from "star" players. I can't wait...       Anyway, it all points to Boozer securing the sure $14 mill rather than take a chance in a bad market year. I'm preparing to hate it, as I think it means we lose either Millsap or Okur. Dammit.
