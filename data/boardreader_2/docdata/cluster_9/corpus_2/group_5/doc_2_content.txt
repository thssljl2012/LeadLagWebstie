      Meineke Car Care West Virginia vs. North Carolina Charlotte, N.C. Bank of America Stadium Dec. 27, 1 p.m. ESPN WR/QB/RB Pat White, West Virginia RB Noel Devine, West Virginia WR Hakeem Nicks, North Carolina  For those who havenothing better to do on a saturday afternoon...turn this one on. 21-14 in the 1st quarter.  Pat White showing passing skills with a couple of TD passes. Not sure if it is enough to stop him from being moved but he is relying on his arm oer his movement in this one.  Hakeem Nicks is a thickly built WR who has gotten down field on two huge TD plays. Looks dynamic after the catch and has shown good hands.   Way too strong and athletic for West Virgina's DBs. Had only seen one previous game with him, but I am walking away that he at least a NFL 2nd rounder, if not higher.
