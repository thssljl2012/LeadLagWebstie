 With the current CBA in baseball as is with no hard salary cap and the difference between the rich teams getting bigger and bigger, I think its just a matter of time before owners of certain teams just give up. Its only natural with no comptitve balance in place, certain cities have certain advantages over others. MLB is the only league that has New York and advantage over a small city like Baltimore just because they have a bigger population and more media and thus can make more to spend on players. So here are the franchises that I could see fold in the next 5-10 years if no salary cap is put into place  Florida, Pittsburgh, Washington, Kansas City, Toronto(with owner dying, who knows what the future lies), Atlanta and Colorado. Thats 3 teams in the NL East, 1 in the AL East, and 1 each in the AL Central, NL Central and NL West. Once the rich owners see their profits going down as there are less games to play, thats when something maybe done but I doubt it.  I do think, MLB will be down to about 20 teams or less by 2020.    and you think this is a bad thing?
