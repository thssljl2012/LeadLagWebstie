 Carolina needs a DT more than DE. Peppers should be locked up and we have Charles Johnson developing on the other side, he should be a starter next year. Tyler Brayton would be a capable back up/rotation. Basically what I&amp;#039;m saying is that with our 1st pick, we need to take a DT because we don&amp;#039;t have really anyone to brag about there.        DE isn&amp;#039;t a necessarily  BAD  pick, just less value to us than a solid DT would be there.    _________________                Quote:           Bank of America Stadium ranked 13th among league venues...perhaps because so many club-level fans spend the second half of games inside sipping chardonnay...
