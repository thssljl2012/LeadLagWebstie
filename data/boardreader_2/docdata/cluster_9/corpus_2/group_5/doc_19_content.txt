It takes fun out of the game by making it annoying and unrealistic and at times plain stupid. Yes it would feel good playing it but i cba with it. Its not a measure of how good a player is but more so how much patience hes got and nailing the perfect route.  .                      Veteran mode is incredibly hard and frustrating on all the COD games, unless you have supreme patience.  But why go to the opposite extreme and play on recruit, if a games to easy it will be dull?  at least thats what i find.     Like Blackstar, I think Hardened is about right for me, bordering on difficult and i thoroughly enjoyed it.
