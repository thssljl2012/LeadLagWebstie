Just so we can all figure out what we can expect, what&amp;#039;s the maximum salary that Bosh, Wade and Lebron can command in 2010?    New CBA unfortunately (I think), so we won&amp;#039;t know for sure.    http://members.cox.net/lmcoon/salarycap.htm#Q11    30% of whatever the cap is probably, but that % could change, and the cap number certainly will.  Probably starting around 18 or 19 million/year.
