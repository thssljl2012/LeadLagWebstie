    Singh sidelined two months with tendinitis        World No. 3   Vijay Singh   is expected to be sidelined for at least two months because of an arm injury.     Tendinitis in Singh&amp;#039;s left forearm has ruled him out of the Iskandar Johor Open in Malaysia from Oct. 30-Nov. 2 and the Champions Tournament in Shanghai from Nov. 6-9.       &amp;amp;quot;I am very disappointed to miss the Iskandar Johor Open and the HSBC event as I was looking forward to returning to Asia,&amp;amp;quot; the 45-year-old Singh said in a news release issued by the Asian Tour on Tuesday.       &amp;amp;quot;As disappointing as it will be to miss the tournaments it is important I follow my doctor&amp;#039;s instructions and do what is best for my long-term health.&amp;amp;quot;       Singh, of Fiji, has won three times on the PGA Tour this year, including the Barclays Classic in August and this month&amp;#039;s Deutsche Bank Championship which helped him clinch victory in the FedExCup playoff series.       &amp;amp;quot;We are obviously very disappointed but I understand from his manager that his injury is serious and will need two months of rest,&amp;amp;quot; said Iskandar Johor Open organizing committee chairman Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman.     ***This will be the 1st time since birth that he doesn&amp;#039;t hit 1000 golf balls a day***
