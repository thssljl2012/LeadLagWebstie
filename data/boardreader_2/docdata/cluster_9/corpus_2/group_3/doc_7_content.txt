  The umpireing got worse in the playoffs and series when the umps went on strike. On their CBA it was argreed to have every ump. work a playoff or series every couple years. Use to be only the ones who gaded highest during the year umped the series.But as the saying goes they are human and humans make nistakes. Just when an ump. works the plate be consistent on the calls.I must be 6the only one saying this LETS GO PHILLIES!
