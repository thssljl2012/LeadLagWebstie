The Raps will never go above the luxury as long as they are majority owned by a Pension Plan.   The Pension Plan is already in a deficit to cover future obligations, no way are they gonna spend another 10 million for a 5 million player to make the team slightly better. Its just poor business sense. A guy like Pietrus would be costing us 10 million, and people honestly think he is the guy that puts us over top.  The problem with the Raps is that Jermaine&amp;#039;s contract is not economically friendly under todays CBA, he has one of those grandfathered deals that few NBA players still have.   I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if Jermaine is dealt at the trade deadline, expecially if Bargnani improves his play. Even if we are still in the playoff picture I could see BC dealing Jermaine and someone like Graham to a team like Cleveland who are legit contenders and take back a package like Wally, Varaejo, Pavlovic and a 1st rounder.
