The 3 year contract Wade, Bosh, and Lebron signed have nothing to do with opting out to leave their current teams.  It has to do with passing the 7 year veteran mark and being able to earn more money on their next contract.    http://members.cox.net/lmcoon/salarycap.htm#Q11    The max contract mark jumps from 25% of the cap after year 6, to 30% of the cap after year 7.  That&amp;#039;s going to be around a $3-4 million dollar difference in the 2010/11 starting salary when they all sign their next max contracts, and then you can add on higher 10% raises with the new higher starting salary for even higher returns if they sign with their current teams.  There is another jump in max contracts to 35% of the cap at 10+ years, so unless they&amp;#039;re worried about injuries (Wade maybe in that boat), they&amp;#039;ll probably sign another similar contract in the summer of 2010, and then look to sign a max length deal after that.  But that will all also depend on what&amp;#039;s included in the next CBA.  So, Bosh will opt out (or at least, should opt out).  But if he&amp;#039;s playing like a max guy at the time, he will be re-signing with the Raps for a huge amount of money.
