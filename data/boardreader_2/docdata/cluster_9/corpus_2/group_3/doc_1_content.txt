That is so true to be unreal      his first questions were all about the CSLs and then onto money      anyway they turned up in a M3 they had bought from a dealer on way up ( 2 guys looking for 1 each )      all happy with car and then bargaining started       I told him before he set off that it was 13k min, he kept trying different stuff but got 13k &amp;amp;quot;take it or leave it&amp;amp;quot;      in the end I did leave the private late on, as much cos I couldnt be arsed to get it changed      now money, well slag me off but I did take cash      he dint want to come up from Essex again so I asked to see cash and it was in sealed Securitas bag with Barclays stamp on      I then asked for ID - all ok      I then asked for the receipt from the bank for the cash- produced form Barclays in his home town      still unsure at this point so rang my brother for advice and he said ring Danny who is a mate who runs a slot machine arcade      spoke to Danny who told me he gets 6 monthly training from Police re fake notes and has UV equip etc      so off to Dannys and spent an hour checking all notes , learnt stuff I never knew       also took photo of the guy before he left       They only had 12.5 so went to cash machine for rest      I know I really shouldnt have taken cash but I believe I took enough precautions         anyway hopefully all ok, I needed to sell but am gutted at the price for what is a superb car
