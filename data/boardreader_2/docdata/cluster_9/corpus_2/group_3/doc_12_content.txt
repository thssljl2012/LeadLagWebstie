I&amp;#039;m not a CBA guru but I&amp;#039;m pretty sure that the Cavs have Bird Rights on Bron I believe so IF they extend him then it DOES NOT effect their cap space.....if I&amp;#039;m wrong please correct me.....    There are cap holds on players you have bird rights.  To clear the cap hold, you have to renounce the bird rights.  Clearly they won&amp;#039;t renounce their rights on LeBron.  But to bring another superstar to play with LeBron (say wade or bosh), they have to be far enough under the cap to sign both players.  To do that, they have to renounce everyone else who expires, not bring in anyone else new that would be under contract in 2010.  That leaves them with LeBron, Williams, Gibson, Hickson and West + say Bosh, which certainly could give them a strong 6 man lineup (assuming Hickson pans out), but pretty much just the league minimum salary left to sign players to fill out the roster.  Perhaps the bigger issue is it means they didn&amp;#039;t trade expiring contracts this year to upgrade the team (Wally with 13 million) and didn&amp;#039;t trade Ben Wallace next year ($14 million expiring) to upgrade the team as well as losing Andy for nothing.  The alternative is to trade Wally and Ben over the next two years for younger impact players (as teams have fire sales to get under the 2010 cap and retain the core we have now), resign Andy, resign Z in 2010 when he probably has a couple of productive years left, etc.  It&amp;#039;s certainly tempting to go after a Wade or Bosh, but not if it&amp;#039;s going to cost the team to win a title or two before then with a core that can be retained beyond 2010.
