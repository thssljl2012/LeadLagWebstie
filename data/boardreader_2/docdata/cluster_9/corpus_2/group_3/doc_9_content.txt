                                              The only reason it&amp;#039;s called the Nationwide Series is because of the insurance company that stepped up to the plate to sponsor the series. It has nothing to due with racing nation wide.    This series is a building block for young drivers. Why should these young people have to compete with cup regulars for the series championship? It is not fair to these young men and women trying to start a racing career to have all the glory taken by the cup drivers. I have no problem with the cup drivers running in the series, but I don&amp;#039;t think they should be eligible for the championship trophy at the end of the year.   I guess you could look at it in another light.  Maybe the cup drivers that are running a full schedule in the Nationwide series along with the Cup series do so because they know they cannot win the championship at the cup level so they figure they can go take the trophy from the kids.   Just one fans opinion.
