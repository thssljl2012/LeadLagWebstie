There MUST be corners being cut to be able to retail wheels for less than 30-40 each!                      I&amp;#039;m getting my wheels/tyres from  www.wheel-base.co.uk    For the wheels alone it&amp;#039;s 300   with budget tyres 400   with Toyos PX4/T1-R 500      My guess is they make minimum profit on the Toyo&amp;#039;s and more on the budget tyres and the wheels themselves, knowing that the pikeys will go for the biggest baddest wheels they can afford.      I knew that the wheels wouldn&amp;#039;t be as good as OEMs, but I needed to get rolling again and I CBA with OEM/used/ebay etc. My car is a means of transport first and a toy second. As longs as the wheels are round and won&amp;#039;t buckle when I squash a rabbit I&amp;#039;m happy.        I&amp;#039;ll compare the weight of them against my OEMS when I get them.
