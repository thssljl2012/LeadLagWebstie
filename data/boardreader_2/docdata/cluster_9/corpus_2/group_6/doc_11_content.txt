        QUOTE (nitetrain8601 &amp;#064; Jan 2, 2009 &amp;#045;&amp;gt; 01&amp;#58;02 AM)       There was an article somewhere(can't remember where) basically stating the Pats were considering it because of Brady and they are also thinking about doing it and then trading him. I don't know if that would be legal or not as I'm not familiar with the NFL's CBA.    I believe the way it works is that once they place the franchise tag on Cassel, it just means that they have exclusive rights to negotiate with him.  He can take the one year deal or they can offer a multi-year dear.  Or they can trade him but they get 2 draft picks out of the deal.
