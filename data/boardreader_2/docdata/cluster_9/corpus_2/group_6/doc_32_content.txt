  sheets- what are you thoughts on this statement?   Last weekend, Charley Casserly of CBS said that the Jets are projected to be nearly $10 million over the 2009 salary cap.  And since this will be the last year with a salary cap under the current CBA, the Jets won't be able to use time-honored tools of reducing current cap numbers by, for example,paying big chunks of base salary up front and spreading the excess over the life of the deal.       I don't read that to say, "you can't turn roster bonuses into signing bonuses." It's perfectly legal, has always been done, and I can't believe the Jets wouldn't be allowed to do it.  Not sure I believe we're $10 mil over, but if we are... save $13 mil on Favre, save $3mil+ on Barrett, save $20+ mil (it will be into the 20's) on roster bonuses, and maybe $4-5mil on other smaller cuts. That gets us close to $30 mil under. More money than is necessary. Hence, no cap issues.
