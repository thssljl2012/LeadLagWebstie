Is that just something teams have to prepare for and think about before going on a player-shopping binge (:cough: Redskins :cough ?                      They need to agree to a new CBA before the old one expires. Of course, it would likely have to have some provision to protect teams from screwing themselves over in 2010 (e.g., some sort of a luxury tax instead of a hard cap in 2010).      And keep in mind Gene Upshaw said, before he died, "once the salary cap goes away, it's gone forever." The players will  never  agree to a new hard cap unless it's  demonstrably  a case of hard cap versus no jobs.
