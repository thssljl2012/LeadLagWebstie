LeBron is going to sign an extension this offseason or next , he can always demand a trade later on.  Most of the max type FA's took shorter deals because at the time revenues were way up and this would allow them to either wait on a new CBA that could give them more money or they could sign the longest deal possible under the old rules.  My guess guys will take option 2.
