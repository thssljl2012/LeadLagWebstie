He can't lead a team on his own and it'll be hard to surround him with quality players because he takes up most of the cap. It'll be like KG in Minnesota except Bosh isn't as good as KG.    No, it won't be like KG in Minny.  KG signed that crazy contract before the current CBA took place and his salary took up a HUGE part of the Wolves cap. His current salary is just grandfathered from the old agreement and at a rate that Bosh can never get to.  Bosh will be worth the max or 30% of the salary cap when he re-signs with us in 2010.
