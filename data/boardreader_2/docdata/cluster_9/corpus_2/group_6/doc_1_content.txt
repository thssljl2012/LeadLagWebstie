        QUOTE (barack oballa &amp;#064; Jan 8 2009, 02&amp;#58;35 PM)       can someone explain to me in layman's terms what exactly is going on and why this could be very bad news for portland? i read some yahoo sports article on it and all i could gather was that miles has two more games to play before portland exceeds its salary cap. why is portland responsible for miles' salary if he doesn't even play for them? why is a luxury tax so bad? is it a lot of money? should anyone but the blazers organization and fans care? what is the meaning of life?     Basically, the Blazers cut Miles and then claimed he had a &amp;quot;career-ending injury.&amp;quot; There are bylaws in the current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that state that if a player does indeed suffer such an injury that the team can get salary cap/luxury tax relief. They still have to pay his contract, it just doesn't count against the cap. Such injuries have to be corroborated by a doctor, as far as I know.  The hitch is that if a team does this but the player doesn't actually have a career ending injury, and that player appears in 10 games (preseason, regular or postseason) during the duration of the contract, their contract is put back on the books. For the Blazers, this would wipe &amp;#036;9m from their salary cap next year.
