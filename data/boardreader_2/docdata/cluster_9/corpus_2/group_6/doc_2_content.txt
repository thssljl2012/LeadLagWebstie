Figure it out.            Quote:                          Originally Posted by  Mathius         A.  Portland had him taken off the books for a reason.  A &amp;quot;career-ending&amp;quot; injury.

Portland was wrong, and has no case here.                           And let's look at the fact that you're ignoring: What is &amp;quot;career-ending&amp;quot;, how is it defined in the contract and within the rules of the collective bargaining agreement. What you consider career-ending, and what has to be proven in a court of law by a qualified party according to the CBA are two entirely different things. Then ten games is not a formality, it's specifically written into the CBA. Portland is not wrong, but may not be right. It's for the court or arbitrator to decide based upon the arguments placed in front of them during litigation or arbitration.

Again, Portland is trying to set a precedent here, where the union stands to lose money.  They are not going to just pretend to be ignorant of this fact.  Whether they handle it publicly or behind close doors, you can bet steps will be taken on Miles behalf.                           In this, you are absolutely correct. This move by Portland gives Miles a really nice chunk of legal leverage to use against Portland. Again, I'm not an attorney, but I guarantee Darius Miles is talking to one about all of the ways he can bring litigation against Portland and the NBA as well. Of course, Portland will be able to defend themselves as well, and again this could be something that drags on for quite some time. However, what you don't seem to comprehend is that this doesn't mean Portland still can't do what they're doing. Whether or not any teams signs Miles, at this point he probably has enough to bring a case against Portland and/or the NBA.

Congress stuck their noses in it and all kinds of doors were opened.                           Exactly. Just in case you forgot, the commissioner of the league is a very accomplished attorney and arbitrator. Portland is obviously trying to force the league to take action.      My theory on what will end up happening is that no team will sign Miles, mainly because nobody really wanted to sign Miles in the first place. Miles will sue Portland and/or the NBA and end up with a settlement or judgment in his favor. I doubt he'll end up playing in the NBA again after this, not because of this whole ordeal, but because he's really not an NBA caliber player anymore (and it's arguable that he ever was anything more than a raw athletic talent that never proved himself). He made good money, and there's a good chance he'll end up making more by the time all of this is through.      I think it's pretty sad that all of this crap is happening over Darius Miles though. Why couldn't it have been someone who would've made a difference somewhere besides the bottom line?
