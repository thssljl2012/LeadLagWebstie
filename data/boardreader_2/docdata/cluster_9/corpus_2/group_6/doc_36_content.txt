His cap figure under this hypothetical approach would be $6mm salary + $5mm bonus recognition = $11mm, or ~$3mm less than the franchise figure, in 2009.   The acquiring team need not recognize the $14mm franchise figure.       Thanks.  ALways appreciate your understanding.                      I would re-word this slightly: &amp;quot;the team that trades for him would not be under an obligation to honor the franchise tender contract.&amp;quot; I have to double-check the relevant portion of the CBA, but they would have to have enough cap room to take whatever contract Cassel signed with the Pats first, but could then sign him to a new contract.
