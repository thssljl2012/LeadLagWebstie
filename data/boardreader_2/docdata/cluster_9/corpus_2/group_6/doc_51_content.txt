Also, generally the cap room per team has gone up each year. How much is it expected to grow this year? I personally think getting all these players signed is very possible. Does anyone have the time to see what players are already under contract through 2010+ and what they count against the cap during the years when these players I discussed above would be getting paid their large sums of money.                      uncapped = death of the chargers super bowl chances...        No way we could compete with teh cowboys, and redskins money... would take a lot of creative drafting and just wouldnt be the same.     If the NFL is uncapped for more then 1 year, i stop watching it. I hate the BCS but it would be better then knowing i cant get excited about a player because the team needs to trade him for draft picks... then those guys for draft picks, then those guys for draft picks... then hope all those guys pan out enough to give us a chance for a year, then watch them join the cowboys.     Anyway my opinion in priority.     1. Rivers: A franchise QB keeps you contending. It would be hard to do better hten him, and i think he will continue to grow.      2. Merriman: This guy makes everyone look better... we saw what happens when he isnt around.... phillips,l castillo, ect all look worse. (granted Jammal makes him look really good...)     3. Jackson: these last 3 are tough... With the Chambers Contract expiring I think we need to avoid losing both our starting receivers within a year of each other. I still doubt his ability to go up and make the high catches and be a consistent #1 but it would be hard to find better at #2.      4. Mcneal: He looks good at times... and gets thrown around like a rag doll at others.      5. Cro: Jurry is out. His picks are nice but he isn't getting them without a pass rush. The fractured hip explains a lot... i hope. Attitude is also questionable right now.
