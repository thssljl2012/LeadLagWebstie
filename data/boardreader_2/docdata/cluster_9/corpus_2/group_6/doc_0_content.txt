The CBA doesnt conclusively cover the salary cap implications of a player attempting a comeback with a team other than the team that received salary cap relief.  The Blazers are going to have their salary cap space in 2009 regardless what happens with Miles' comeback attempt.  Don't forget the only reason Miles is able to attempt his comeback is because the Blazers released him last year after having a meeting with David Stern. The Blazers didn't have to release Miles and they could have assured that Miles would not play in any games. The Blazers could have kept Miles out of the NBA and they have the doctors opinions to back their conclusion that Miles shouldn't play. And, the NBA's doctors confirmed the findings of the Blazers doctors .     that's an interesting notion. Are you sure it's true that Portland would have secured the salary cap relief if they didn't waive Miles?  if that's the case, then the only reason to waive would be to open a roster spot and at this point, it sure doesn't look like the blazers need a roster spot as much as they could use the cap-space Miles's salary represents.   As I recall it, the Blazers didn't waive Miles until after they petitioned for salary cap relief and it was granted.
