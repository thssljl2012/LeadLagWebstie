It`s not really a suspension, it`s a technicality. The only exception is if a player is signed to an entry level contract then they can turn down the invitation to the all star game. Hence why Mason was alowed to play in the game against Calgary.                      It is not in the CBA, it isn't even written down. At least that is what most reports seem to indicate.
