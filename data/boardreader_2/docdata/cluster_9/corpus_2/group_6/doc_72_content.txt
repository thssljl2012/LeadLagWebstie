Is that assumption still valid, especially in light of the worldwide economic downturn/catastrophe?  Anyway, the situations for previous Raps were unique. Who knows? But if in 2010 we're a perennial playoff team with capspace and a PG who can make you look good, then there really shouldn't be a problem.    I'm quite curious about that as well.   It's partly correct.  By extending their deals only 3 years, it would make them 7 year veterans, for which a max contract can be a higher % of the cap.  If they signed 6/7 year deals 3 years ago, the yearly salary for years 4~7 would be lower than the potential salary of a new max contract they could sign at that time.  Not only would they be in line for the higher % I mentioned above, but the assumption was also that the cap would increase every year so even the first year of the deal (upon which all subsequent raises are based) would also be higher.  Make no mistake, Bosh did that to maximize his contract value. I don't blame him, but he IS NOT WORTH that amount of money. If I was BC I would think long and hard about dealing him this summer if a more reasonable extension can't be agreed to (they can extend this summer if they want). We could get a great return on any deal now, as opposed to later when the contract is worse and/or his attitude about wanting to be here changes.
