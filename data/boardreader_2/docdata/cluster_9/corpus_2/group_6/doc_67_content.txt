  I say if the players dont like the game, dont put it in the CBA and its as simple as that. If you approve of it, THEN GO! 600 Players, 42 All-Stars. For all we know, they all voted no.  You're right, I'm sure all the non-Allstars would want the game because it would increase revenue and subsequently their salaries.
