        QUOTE (pmxc12873 &amp;#064; Jan 1 2009, 04&amp;#58;29 PM)       I'll take Spezza  At 25 years old, he has had seasons of  Goals - 22,19,34,34,15 so far this year Points - 55,90,87,92,28 this year  And before people cry his defence...Career +83 in 357 gms  His offence can make up for his defence.  Teams can't score if the pucks in their defensive zone.  And, it can fit in the cap AND keep Toews, Kane, Keith.  Although the cap is going to remain the same, bonuses arent going to count against it next year.  Trade Habby, Buff, Barker, Kontiola.....for Spezza and Neil.     Too much money for too long, he has the same deal as Campbell basically but also has a NO TRADE clause that kicks in on July 1st. 2nd I could put up 40 points playing with Heatly and Alfie, as much as he is a superstar he is a complimentary one not a guy who can carry a team. Though he is talented the problem is the lentgh of the deal. Even if the cap stays where it is and assuming we could sign Toews and Kane for (5 mil each which would be a bargain) Thats 24 million dollars or half our cap space on 4 players. That's not counting a deal for Keith, or Huet's money either. And yes bonuses won't count against the cap next year, but they WILL AGAIN when its the last year of the CBA again.  Lastly Ottawa has only 2 mil in cap space. Trading 14 million for 8 mil, wouldn't work for them and why would we stick ourselves in the same long term cap problem they have? Because of all their contracts they couldn't get a goaltender and had to trade much of their defense, they took their shot at the cup and now they're out of it, theres no reason to shorten our window. We have our stars and now just need to fill in complimentary players around them.
