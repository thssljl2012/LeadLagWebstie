      If Portis were to get released, the bonuses that were part of his contract accelerate to payment immediately.  Any bonuses that he has would get paid immediately.  Some bonuses do not like roster bonuses. But if the CBA gets extended, then we can use him as the June cut and split the bonuses over two years.          Last I heard is that we are not having June cuts, so that does not necessarily imply with Portis's contract as of now.         But whatever bonuses are not paid out get accelerated to the years salary cap and count entirely towards that year.  It would be considered dead cap space.         His salary would not count but any bonuses do. _________________          Thanks AnaheimTitans for the sig...
