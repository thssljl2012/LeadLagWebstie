I wonder what the league would do if they played Miles in the next game and he had a catastrophic injury, like a compound femur fracture?  Technically, it would seem that the mere checking into the next game would be enough to trigger it so the money would be back on our cap and that we would subsequently have to wait one year from the injury date to apply to have him removed again, but if he is injured in his tenth game where he is essentially on parole to determine if he actually has a career-ending injury maybe that changes the situation?    No matter what fans of other teams say, the language on the CBA leaves so much room for wiggle it is almost silly at times.
