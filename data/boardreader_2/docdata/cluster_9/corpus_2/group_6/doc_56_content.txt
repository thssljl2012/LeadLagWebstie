Did Bargnani suddenly become a better player than Bosh? Did someone have sooo much sagacity, that they saw into the future, where Bargnani somehow becomes a better player than Bosh?      Once you accept that a front court of finesse players will not win a championship, you should also come to the realization that one of Bosh or Bargs has to be traded. And because it's naive thinking to believe that Bosh will stick around passed 2010, he should be the one to go.     First of all, where does it say you can't win a championship with a duo such as Bargs/Bosh.  We have a 20/10 PF and a guy who can atleast adequately defend opposing Center's.  If this team puts in some defensive schemes (like they have since JT took over, just need more) and let these two guys who are both 24 and 23 years old develop, there's nothing to suggest they couldn't win together.  Second, why is it naive to think Bosh will re-sign?  Even if this team is in the crapper, I doubt a player like Bosh is going to leave 30 million dollars on the table considering the current economic times we are in, the possible drying up of sponsorship dollars, a possible reduction in the cap and a new CBA looming in 2011.  I mean the Celtics won and they have a finesse PF in KG and Perkins startign in their frontcourt.  Perkins is better defensively than Bargs but Bargs is improving.  If he can get his 'd' up and Bosh gets some offensive help where he doesn't have to carry the load so much his defense can be better too, we've got one of the most talented PF/C combinations in the league.
