Where did the NFL ever ever say the Pats cheated?? The violated a rule just like Denver and SF did with the salary cap. BTW violating the salary cap is much more of competitive advantage. You get a player you have no right in getting.  Taping signals-one game-doesn't violate federal laws.  Signing a player illegally-hurts the entire NFL, never mind it violates a CBA which is violating a federal law.
