The only way they  might  have a legitimate grievance is if the Patriots acted in bad faith (i.e., by trading Cassel somewhere he manifestly did not want to go).      As I've pointed out before, aside from the &amp;quot;good faith negotiations&amp;quot; rule, there is  no  stated requirement in the CBA that the Patriots have to make any sort of effort to sign him to a long-term deal.
