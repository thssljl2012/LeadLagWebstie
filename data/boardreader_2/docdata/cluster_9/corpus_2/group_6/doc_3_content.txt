I voted yes because I thought you meant the league salary cap would be set as a percentage of league revenue, and each team would be under the same salary cap, similar to the NBA, NFL, and NHL.  I'd prefer a soft cap like the NBA that has some exceptions and a luxury tax.  I think that would be a great idea, which I hope will be incorporated into the next CBA.  If every team has a different salary cap, what's the point?
