Yeah, we're all just the haters, the rest of the NBA is simply trying to **** with the blazers cause they're so scared of that borderline playoff team. The blazers are the real victims here, the NBA should allow them to take advantage of the loopholes in the CBA and look away from the fact that they could have benefited from something that they shouldn't have. Clearly anyone who doesn't think the almighty blazers are victims here are just haters. Got it!  Give me a break, the entire Portland Trailblazers organization should hang their heads in shame after their plan to try to  manipulate the rules and getting an unfair advantage backfired in their faces.
