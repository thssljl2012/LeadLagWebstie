I understand that, but if it was an argument that worked for both Boston and Memphis ("Hey... he's a guy we want to take a look at. We think he can help. &amp;amp;c.") it seems that Portland could use it, as well.      The rest of the NBA appears to be avoiding the "cap manipulation" charges, and Portland should (or might) be able to have a "safe harbor", as well.      And, really, is it less fair on Shavlik Randolph that he's stuck at the end of the bench than that Darius Miles would be?      Ed O.
