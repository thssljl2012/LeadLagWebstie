But how about a blockbuster trade for the interest and comments of all concerned.Remember that the CBA expires and so does the CAP next year. Keep that in mind because I am not as fluid on CAP as Miguel.  LJ wants out. At 29 he has some years left and is healthy. When he is healthy he is a premier RB. I am not a big fan, but he does have some outstanding games.    Gonzales is 33 it's true. Some say he is washed up (right....96 receptions). K.C would have taken a three for him last fall. His contract is fairly CAP friendly and it is for three years. I would love him for at leat two. He would be a great "Welcome back! Tom" present. TG is an immediate upgrade to our "O". If we need a blocking TE in a situation. the Hochstein experiment worked fine. Actually Watson is getting better in blocking (but the down spiral in catching).    My proposal for your comments and anger are thus: Maroney, Thomas  and Cassel for LJ, Gonzales and the Chiefs second round pick and first round swap of picks (we know BB would trade down after that). Worse case scenario is we move LJ. LJ might flourish here with a top tier passing attack. He is definitely trade bate for K.C. Seems the new G.M. scouted hand picked those three guys in his other life. It puts a little stamp on the team and cleans up some business.     Now SP has $30 million under CAP to spend on FAs and some younger players that he knows. We get something for Cassel, a little for Maroney (who is from that area) and Thomas is no great loss but a body to fill Gonzales shoes for K.C. on their end to make this work.     LJ could be the unexpected bonus here. Ask yourself, would you rather have a fully healthy LJ in a fresh winning environment or "Dancing with the Stars" Maroney? No question Pioli does not have to do due diligence on the players he gets from us.     TB has got a few more rings in him. Lets get him some more toys with added draft choices to upgrade the "D" ......OR THE HELL WITH IT, Just swap Cassel for Peppers. Your choice.    DW Toys
