        QUOTE (haroldsnepsts &#064; January 15, 2009 &#045; 05:31PM)       This is kind of off topic, but I still think they should have some exception in the CBA only a percentage of a player's salary counts against the cap if he was drafted by that team.  It'll help franchises retain players, which helps build an identity for the team and is better for the fans.  Can you imagine if Detroit could get a discount on all the talent they've drafted?    In the Australian Football League there is a thing called the veteran's list which is comprised of players that are of 30 years of age or more and have served the current club for a minimum of ten years. Such players have only 50% of their salary counted towards the cap. Something like this sound more feasible with a limitation on the amount of players on the list.  I think it's a great idea because it promotes loyalty, which sadly, is kinda rare in American sports.
