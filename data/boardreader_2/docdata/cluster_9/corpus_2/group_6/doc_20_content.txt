Of course, they could cut or restructure some other players and do some things that we used to do, but unless Gross or Peppers gives a huge home team discount, one of them is gonna test the market.                          This is a general point I was wondering about when I saw the Allen news conference. Did anyone else get the feeling when he was talking about the cap and letting the excess carry over a couple of years running, that there was actually a plan in that other than signing our own players again?    I'm referring to the fact that he said in since this is the last year of the CBA, there are going to more teams making 'cap decisions' than usual. What I'm asking is, did our front office look ahead and say team X has several nice players, they won't be able to resign all of them when their contracts expire, lets get some cap room to carry over in anticipation of that. Does anyone know of teams/players in this situation? I just got the feeling there was a bit more long term method to his madness than just resigning players we felt needed rewarding.    Edit: Now, my financial/economic knowledge is disastrous at best, so I'm open to someone telling me that the CBA doesen't work like that or some sort of other fact based obliteration of my idea. It's just a feeling I got from listening that's all.
