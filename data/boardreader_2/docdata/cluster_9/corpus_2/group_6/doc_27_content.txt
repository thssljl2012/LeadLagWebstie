They should have nabbed him after Memphis waived him and they should have had him sit on the bench, inactive, for the rest of the year.      Once he's cleared waivers, he can decide where he wants to sign... meaning NOT Portland.      If every other team (or at least two) can claim that he's good enough to take a look at, Portland certainly should have been able to avail themselves of the same thing.      Hell... the case is MORE easily made now that he's able to help (in the right circumstances) than when Boston or Memphis gave him a shot.      That Darius might only get into one more game the rest of the year? That would be tragic but he just wasn't QUITE able to contribute as an active player in two games. Tough break.      But, oh, we get to keep the cap space...      Ed O.                        I think the obvious issue with that is that the league might look at that sort of action as bad faith and say it's circumvention of the cap.  The CBA has a catch all clause that lets the league prevent anything that isn't specifically covered under the rules but appears to be cap manipulation.
