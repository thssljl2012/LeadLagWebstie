Since the cap space is based solely on the Blazers' claim that Miles is unable to play basketball, signing him may remove the 10 game requirement.  If the Blazers sign him, obviously their claim that he can't play is no longer valid.     I haven't seen the CBA to verfiy this, but it seems to make sense to me.
