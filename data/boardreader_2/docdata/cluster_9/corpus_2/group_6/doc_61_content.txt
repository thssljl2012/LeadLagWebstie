Dunk, I hear you saying you have been told that, but I just can't buy that for several reasons.  One is,  the CBA itself says otherwise .  It says you calculate the team salary by adding salaries plus empty slots. Before you add the 12th salary, there is one empty slot so you add a cap hold. After you add the 12th salary, there is no empty slot so no cap hold to be added in that calculation. That makes it as either/or of course.  Second,  common sense .  If you are $5M under the cap with 11 players, you obviously have $5M left to spend on that 12th player. Not $4.5M.  Third,  NBA history .  It's very relevant that teams spend right up to their cap. All of it.   Fourth, one  purpose of the cap hold  itself is to set aside money to be used on that 12th player.  Fifth,  another point of having cap holds  on the first 12 slots is to prevent teams from filling their cap and then using the MSE to fill those slots.   Whoever told you that just wasn't thinking clearly.
