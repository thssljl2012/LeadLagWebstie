 Rocketsnow, I don't believe you understand how the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the salary cap works. You have suggested in many threads that the Rockets "take T-mac and Alstons" salaries and aquire Wade. T-mac and Alston will make 28 million together next year. 22 m for T-mac 6 m for Alston. Both contracts expiring in 2009/10. That would seem to be enough to get it done.  Wade will make 16 million expiring in 2009/10. The CBA and the salary cap rules are biased toward the home team holding the contract. Miami can "extend" Wades current contract and give him a 10% raise each year. Meaning in 2010/2011 the Heat can offer him 17.5 million and 10% more the following years.  Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement the Rockets (or any other team) can only offer Wade (or Bryant, Lebron, Wade, Bosh or any player) a 6 year "Max"  new  contract starting out at 12 million dollars. This is why you will see Wade "extended" before his contract expires. Ditto with all the super paid stars with the possible exception of Lebron because the 12 million salary will be augmented with HUGE endorsement money from the New York Market, that might be enough to get him away from the Cavs. What pushes players above MAX is the 10% raises. It's compound interest. Thus Bryant and McGrady making 21 Million this year and 23 million next.  I doubt 12 million will interest Wade when Miami will pay him 17.5 million. The only way to get around the above is to trade for a Wade or Lebron before their contract expires and offer him the extention. I2 million is tops for a  new  contract.
