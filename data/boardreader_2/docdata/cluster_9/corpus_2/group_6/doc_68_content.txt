        QUOTE (Git &#064; Jan 25 2009, 12:43 PM)       I need to do that too buuuuuuuut CBA    I'm pretty lazy so I'm determined this time. I've stuck with it for a week which is already an improvement on previous attempts (IMG: style_emoticons/default/lol.gif )   Josh was gonna do the same but despite having a treadmill in his house he's only made a start on the eating side (IMG: style_emoticons/default/rolleyes.gif )   So when we needed some food yesterday I said we had to walk to the "local" shop (just over a mile away) instead of driving to Tesco (IMG: style_emoticons/default/biggrin.gif )
