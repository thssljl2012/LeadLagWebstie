With the conflicting reports on Brady that are out the PA cannot take issue with the Pats franchising him the last week of February. Now if they miraculously find out the week before the draft in April that Brady will be able to start, then no one can do anything if the Pats trade him.     What a giant loophole for the Pats. You could bring a hundred lawyers together for a week to define this to no avail. Because most ofUS Pats fans didn't think Matt should even be playing and the coach knew what he was doing (like usual) Matt and his agent will/should just ride this one out.
