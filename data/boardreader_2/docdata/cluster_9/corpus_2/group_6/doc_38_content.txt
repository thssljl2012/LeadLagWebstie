Can a contract be structured to have garaunteed salary w/o bonus that would pay hypothetically $8 million in '09 and $12 million in 2010?  Didn't the Pats offer Ty Law a 4 year $24 million garaunteed contract?  Assuming Cassell was eventually traded under this scenario, wouldn't his salary be wiped from the cap.
