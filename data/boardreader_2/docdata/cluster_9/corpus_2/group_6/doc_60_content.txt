I would sleep a lot better knowing that Merriman will be crushing QB's for the Chargers for the next 6 years.                      I'm pretty sure Rivers gets in the $30-40M guaranteed money.  Merriman is the one that may not get signed.  We can get 2 more years out of him by using the franchise tag after next year.  If there is no CBA in place Merriman would become a RFA instead of a UFA, meaning we could put a tender of a 1st and 3rd round pick on him instead of using the franchise tag.  Same thing would happen with Big Mac, Cro and a couple other in the subsequent year.
