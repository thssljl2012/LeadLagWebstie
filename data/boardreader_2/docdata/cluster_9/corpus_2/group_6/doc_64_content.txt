 Thanks for the kind words, LA.     As for the probable uncapped year of 2010 (barring a miraculous CBA agreement over the next half-year), there are severe restrictions in regard to its operation.     Let me do some research over the next couple of days. I know that Florio (in doing what he does best - contract analysis) did an in-depth analysis of the restrictions that would be in place in an uncapped 2010.     In short, my understanding is that the owners set up rules to insure that teams could not buy their way out of cap hell in 2010 - and that will likely be the only uncapped year because the owners will not bring back the NFL until a cap is back in place. Yes, that will mean a strike/lock-out - and it may be a long one.
