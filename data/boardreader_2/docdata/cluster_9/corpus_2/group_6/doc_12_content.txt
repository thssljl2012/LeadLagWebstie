        QUOTE (cehnehdeh &amp;#064; Jan 2 2009, 05&amp;#58;49 PM)       Any CBA geeks in here?  Will LTI cap relief cover from his last game played? If so wont you guys have a TONNE of cap room now to play iwth for the rest of the year? Shanny? Murray?    Why would be want to use it?  It's not like we are going anywhere this year.  We should just let the kids get some experience instead of signing Shanny to take up a roster spot.  Plan for the future&amp;#33;
