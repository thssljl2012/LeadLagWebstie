What I really do not understand and am baffled why NO MAJOR MEDIA outlet is acknowledging is that Miles was evaluated by an INDEPENDENT NBA doctor mutually agreed upon by the players union deeming Miles injury career ending.  Why is it that we are liable and why should we pay for another doctors and league mistake if they felt he could not play? Secondly, we let Miles go with the assumption that his injuries were to severe to play, if he can play (which he was deemed not able to) then he should be the property of the Trailblazers (even though we do not want him). Seems like we are being screwed by the NBA, CBA, Miles and teams around the league.  If he wants to play so damn badly why cant he be forced to sign an injury waiver, voiding his contract and he then has to go out and earn his money if he thinks he is so healthy to play.
