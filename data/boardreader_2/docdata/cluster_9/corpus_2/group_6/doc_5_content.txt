The minimum 2009 salary for a player with Cassel's experience is $620,000. 30% of $620,000 is $186,000. That means his 2010 salary can be no more than $806,000.    Your deal gives Cassel less money in two years than signing the franchise tender immediately.                      That's what we pay Pioli and his guys the big bucks for.  I have said over and over I don't really care about the details of the CBA or the salary rules.  All I am saying is that there is a 2 year deal that would make Cassel happy that would be less than the total of being Franchised in 2009 and again in 2010.  How much less, none of us know.  How would they structure it, that would depend on facts we don't know - how Brady's knee is and what the desire of the Patriots is to trade Cassel + how much they would want for him.    The hypotheticals of what Cassel would accept and what the Patriots would offer don't matter to me.  But the big picture is this :  there is a two year deal the Patriots would make and a two year deal Cassel would make.  How close they are and whether they'd meet in the middle is the question.  But to say &amp;quot;why would Cassel take less in year one&amp;quot; isn't asking the full question if he is happy with getting $5M or more extra guaranteed over the two year deal.  Maybe that $5M more would have to be $7M more - or just $3M more - we don't know.  But it's fully reasonable that a two year deal where Cassel takes less now can be done.  That's all I'm saying.  Don't ask me why he would or how much it would be because I'm not in his mind.  I don't know and no-one here does.
