We all should know that with the Tmac fiasco, not to mention Shaq as well. The Raps would be stupid to let Bosh walk for nothing without at least getting a bunch of picks for their trouble. Bosh would have his choice, but from a small select of teams, not just one in particular. With that said, it would probably take Shard to get it done given the amount Bosh is going to command. Its possible that a package could be done without him involved, but not very likely. I would definitely trade Shard for him though. There aren't many that I would, but Bosh is a sure fire example of one. Sadly, its a dream that isn't going to come true however.    there's a difference between the Raps trading Bosh to say... the Knicks, in return for a draft pick or two, just to make sure Bosh gets the maximum raises possible, and the Raps trading Bosh for spare parts, just because Bosh demands to play for a team that doesn't have cap space.  fact is, it most likely won't be worth it for the Raps, especially if it will impose on them rebuilding.
