       Quote:                         The league notified teams on Friday that Miles had cleared waivers and is eligible to be signed to a standard contract. Any such contract, the league wrote in the email, would be approved by the NBA.       What theyre saying is: Dont let that scare you off,  said one Eastern Conference GM  who had received the memo.                       Um, not really.  They are saying that Miles has cleared waivers (true) and that his contract would be approved (true, by CBA rules), and nothing more.  It says nothing about protection from any "bad faith" action the Blazers may take in the future.      Some real Einsteins in the NBA, huh?
