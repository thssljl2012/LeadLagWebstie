Folks, received 2 fabulous scans from Magnus. Thank you very much, he is always in pursuit of stories and scans to help us build this library. Was wondering if any of you or your friends have the full story or pieces of it. It looks good in color.Enjoyed the last panel of this story---Mandrake receives a ticket for NOT having an inspection sticker on his windshield after helping nab the bank robbers with the money....funny and a nice ending to the story.
