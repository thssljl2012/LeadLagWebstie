    In case today's incredible weather wasn't a kick in the rear enough to get off the couch, tomorrow is the official Opening Day of Running celebration, hosted by Nike. International track superstars Sanya Richards and Alan Webb will host a kickoff fun run along the lake followed by a celebration at Castaways on North Avenue Beach. What could be better than toasting spring in Chicago? How about Nike's $100,000 donation towards improving and resurfacing the lakefront running path. Sweet!  So as many Chicagoans jump off the treadmills and hit the city's sidewalks and running paths in preparation for the first big outdoor race of the year, the Bank of America Shamrock Shuffle on March 29, it may be time for all of us to start thinking about the rewarding challenge of a good run.  That's why our esteemed boss Marcus Gilmer and yours truly have signed up for the Chicago Marathon. Yes, we're writers. Running the marathon. Possibly crazy.  Feel up to the challenge? Keep an eye out this spring for information on the first ever Chicagoist Marathon Crew and kill challenge yourself with us.  The Opening Day of Running celebration kicks off at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow at Castaways on North Avenue Beach. Fun run begins at 11:15 a.m.  (Photo by rebecca anne)
