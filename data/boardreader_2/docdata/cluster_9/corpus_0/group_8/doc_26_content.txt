Friend and fellow blogger, Jen, at Casual Slack has had a shitty run of it lately. While other people I know complain about their jobs, Jen posted this: Like I said before I&#8217;ve been soooo busy with work I&#8217;ve been neglecting my blog Working at home at night &amp; weekends And in honor of all my hard work and dedicated service  Friday my boss CUT MY PAY see kids.. in a recession people don&#8217;t spend any money on advertising.. meaning SOON I&#8217;ll be on the street with a cardboard sign begging people for spare change WOO HOOOOOO! Sympathy comments are welcome. Thanks Jen @ Casual Slack Two things: 1) If you are employed, please shut the fuck up about not liking our job [NOT directed at Jen]. Surely one of the 4.4 million people who have lost their jobs since December 2007 would love to be as unhappy -yet employed- as you. And 2) There is an opportunity here for you, Jen. As you&#8217;re aware, Hallmark doesn&#8217;t make cards that read, &#8220;Dude, that sucks.&#8221; However, given the times, maybe they should. So, there&#8217;s you niche, create a line of recession-related cards with sentiments such as, &#8220;Meh, you hated that place anyway,&#8221; or &#8220;And to think you were worried they&#8217;d figure out it was you peeing in the coffee pot,&#8221; and &#8220;Now&#8217;s the time to act out all you learned by watching Office Space.&#8221; And Jen, knowing your intellect and rapier whit, you could start an advice column with such topics/suggestions as having the Post Office forward your delinquency notices to the CEOs of AIG and Bank of America. I&#8217;m sure there are more, this is just what sprang to mind&#8230;please do share your ideas. And plase do visit Jen at Casual Slack.
