I did not go to bed. I think I will drink some coffee and eat some cereal now.I spent the rest of the night on the internet. I learn so many things every time I do this.I learn disturbingly funny things. NSFW. NSFAnywhere really. (And I found this as a link from a normal blog, before you ask.)I found that Amazon recommends me really shit stuff. But my wishlist kicks ass.CBA to link to where I've been. Probably mainly on MSN anyway. OMG can tell I had no sleep, typing in abbreviations and not caring that it makes me look slightly ignorant.Now I think I'm going to find coffee. Then I'll sleep. Yes, I know that's the wrong order completely, but fuck off. It's how I operate.
