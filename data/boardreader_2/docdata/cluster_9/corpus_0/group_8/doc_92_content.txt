This was my first cup of coffee in Barcelona yesterday morning after arriving on the red eye flight from NYC.  I checked my luggage behind the counter at the hotel -- the room was not ready yet -- and headed to the La Boqueria, a gigantic meat, vegetables and fruits market located right off of La Rambla, the main tourist street of Barcelona.  The market also have numerous cafes and restaurants that serve breakfast and lunch.I discovered later during the day that my US bank card does not allow me withdraw money from the ATM machines here in Barcelona.  This is strange because I was able to withdraw Euros from Rome less than two months ago, and RMB in Beijing, China in 2007.  I have contacted my bank in NYC and hopefully, this situation gets resolved soon or else I will be tap dancing at La Rambla for pocket change.Update: After a 2nd desperate call to the bank, the ATM problem is resolved. I will not have to scrub the toilet as Sally said.
