When Dwayne Wade of the Miami Heat injured his left eye after taking a blow to the face from Charlotte Bobcats forward Juwan Howard, he wore a band-aid to protect it.   It seems, however, that Wade took to wearing Band-Aids just a bit longer than he needed to.  The NBA has banned Wade, and other players, from wearing Band-Aids as a fashion statement as Wade donned band-aids with the words "Wade" and "Flash," the nickname coined by former Heat center Shaquille O'Neal. According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Wade continued to wear the band-aids long after the wound healed.  The NBA has addressed the issue.  "We spoke to [the Heat and Wade]," NBA spokesman Tim Frank said. "A player can wear a Band-Aid for healthcare purposes, but it shouldn't have any name or identifications on it."  "You can't wear an identifiable Band-Aid," Frank continued. "We don't expect it to be an issue, so there will be no need for a penalty."
