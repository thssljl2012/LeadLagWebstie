Terrell Owens is headed to Buffalo.FOXSports.com's Jay Glazer and Alex Marvez are reporting that the Buffalo Bills and wide receiver Terrell Owens have agreed on a one-year, $6.5 million dollar deal that is 100% guaranteed.One thing I'll be curious to see about this deal is if there's a stipulation that Owens won't be franchised in 2010. At present, if no new CBA is reached, and 2010 remains an uncapped year, teams will be able to use both the franchise and transition tag to restrict player movement.
