There probably won&#8217;t be any body surfing tonight after the game, but a Section II Class AA boys&#8217; basketball title will be awarded when Albany Academy takes on Christian Brothers Academy at Times Union Center. Game time is 7. After hosting the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s tournaments since Thursday &#8212; including Siena&#8217;s stirring 77-70 title win over Niagara Monday night to advance to the NCAA Tournament for a second straight year &#8212; the Times Union Center brings back two overtime winners from last Tuesday to decide Section II Class AA supremacy. Albany Academy, ranked No. 2 in the state, is coming off a memorable 60-59 overtime win over 2008 state champion Bishop Maginn. The starting five of senior center Chris Pelcher, senior forward Tyler Foster, junior guard Jamel Fields, junior guard Nolan Hart and senior point guard Jimmer Bennett have waited a year to get to a title game after a humbling 65-48 loss to Bishop Gibbons in the 2008 Class A championship. CBA is making its seventh straight title game appearance and is seeking a title for the first time since 2006. The Brothers, led by junior guard Kameron Ritter, senior center Andrew Stire, sophomore point guard Galal Cancer and sophomore guard Max Weaver, advanced to tonight&#8217;s contest with a win over Suburban Council champion Shenendehowa. My prediction is Albany Academy 65, CBA 58. Do you agree or disagree?
