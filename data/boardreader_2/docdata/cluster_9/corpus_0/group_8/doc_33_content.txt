(via magicmolly). I walked home over this today after yoga. Id like to say it was because it was a beautiful day and everythings turning over into spring and who knows when I will have entire afternoons with which to bridgewalk, and oh, I am falling back in love with my neighborhood and this city and myself, etc. No. Actually, its because of FUCKING BANK OF AMERICA and my not having a debit card with which to pay to ride the train. Oh but also: its turning into Spring! I walked a different way home! I was reminded of when this was all new and entire existential dilemmas could be resolved within the 30 minutes it took to cross the East River!
