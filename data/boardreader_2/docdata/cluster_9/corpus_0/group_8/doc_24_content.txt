SEATTLE - Lorenzo Romar said the rivalry didn't matter, and it didn't.  Propelled by some gritty play down the stretch, the Washington Huskies defeated Washington State 67-60 Saturday at Bank of America Arena, securing their first outright championship since 1953.  And they did it on Senior Day, where Artem Wallace, Jon Brockman and Justin Dentmon finished off their college years in grand style.
