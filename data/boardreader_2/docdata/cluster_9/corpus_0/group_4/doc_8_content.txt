w00t! Oh yeah. I've finally finished that bullshit work placement, bunch of piss taking twats - they offered me 100 to stay on for another week. 100/40 = 2.50/hr, kiss my arse... yeah. Anyway, I took the job at Capita which was the obvious choice, no 2hr commute and I actually get to keep more money in my pocket as there isn't a 4k train fair per year involved anymore. One thing is for sure, I am never going near that kind of shit again as they expect to pay you peanuts, for you to happily do a mission of a commute, work long hours and of course, by the time you get home and eat dinner, it is time to go to work again. That isn't what I want to do... I actually want to be able to do things in the evening thanks. Anyway, onto the good! I got a new proper job, yay, oh fuck yeah! It's a 2nd line support job working for Capita childrens services in Bedford. Am starting on Monday. I went to the WoW: Wrath of the Lich King launch in London on Wednesday evening, there wasn't as much queueing as there was last time and we had some problems actually getting into the queue that I am not going to go into. Once we got in it was all good though, I spoke to some guy from Radio 1 and some woman from the BBC on camera, lol. They didn't have the same cut scene playing over and over this time thank fuck! There was a guy in an actual lich king costume which was awesome, it had glowing blue eyes and everything. I got my collectors edition and buggered off... the tube was closed and the trip back to the hotel was long as I had 5million bags of stuff as I acquired a figure. Check out these awesome photos of the lich king costume, omfg, too awesome! I took today off (as I cba to go to unpaid shizzle, lol) to play WoW. I'm currently lvl 71 on my priest, which isn't too bad. I cant play it hardcore non-stop like some people can though, lol. 1 level in one day is pretty good (2 levelling sessions) considering it's 1.5mil exp to next level, lol.
