Larry Brooks at the New York Post reports the Rangers are seeking a compensatory selection in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft for the loss of Alexei Cherepanov..."Glen Sather raised the issue at the general managers' meeting in Chicago two weeks ago, citing CBA Article 8.3 (b) that stipulates that compensatory picks be awarded to teams unable to sign first-round draft picks.Sather is submitting that the Rangers should receive the 17th selection in the second round of June's draft as compensation for losing Cherepanov..."Sam Weinman at the Rangers Report has this quote from Assistant GM Cameron Hope on the circumstance...In our opinion the CBA provision does provide a protection that extends to cover certain eventualities, including tragedies like what occurred with Cherepanov, both in a reasonable reading of the CBA provision and certainly in the spirit of the provision.We know that its new ground for the League, this terrible circumstance (not the usual way that a Club loses the rights to a pick), but once it is considered and we work through any concerns, we think we have good arguments for our position on this. ...i sort of cringed when I first saw this, but business is business and if the Rangers are eligible for a compensatory pick they should get it.
