 I'm not really sure what to say about this one. It's a very touchy subject, and the Rangers have approached it in that way, which is good. I'll let Larry Brooks explain.  The Rangers New York Rangers  are seeking a compensatory selection in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft for the loss of Alexei Cherepanov, The Post has learned.  Glen Sather raised the issue at the general managers' meeting in Chicago two weeks ago, citing CBA Article 8.3 (b) that stipulates that compensatory picks be awarded to teams unable to sign first-round draft picks.  Sather is submitting that the Rangers should receive the 17th selection in the second round of June's draft as compensation for losing Cherepanov, the 17th overall selection in the 2006 Draft who died in Russia on Oct. 13 while playing for Omsk.Wow. Well... Um. I mean, they are technically entitled to a compensation pick. They are between a rock and a hard place. There may no be any easy way to go about this. Business is business and you have to move on at some point. Sure is a unique and interesting situation, though. James Mirtle has an interesting poll on the subject, and his readers are pretty definitive on the subject. I'll leave you all to judge this one as well because I'm pretty toungue tied.
