Tonight at Christian Brothers Academy, a rematch of the Section II Class AA championship takes place when the Brothers host two-time defending champion Bishop Maginn. CBA is off to a 4-0 start and the Golden Griffins improved to 4-0 Saturday with a Big 10 win over Bishop Gibbons. The Brothers will need senior center Andrew Stire, junior guard Kameron Ritter and sophomore guard Galal Cancer to come through with big performances against the No. 2 ranked Golden Griffins. Can CBA pull the upset?
