We got out of work early today, so I decided to swing by the bank to deposit my Christmas bonus check. (Which I totally wasn't expecting to even get. Score!)Bank of America's coverage up here is hella spotty, so I had to drive out to Poughkeepsie to do my depositing. So I drive and drive and drive through the shitty weather. Finally get there, and of course, there's a line at the drive-thru ATM. So I wait and wait and wait. Get up to the ATM... and it's not accepting check deposits. I was all miffed, so I just drove off. Fortunately I remembered that I had left my card in the machine before I got out of the parking lot. Even more fortunately, the guy in the line behind me was the ATM service person, so he gave me my card and told me to come back in half an hour.I killed some time on Route 9, then came back, and the line was wrapping around the bank. Supalame. But I couldn't complain too much, as the guy in front of me was going through on foot, in line with all the cars in the shitty weather.I wasn't sure if I should invite him to sit in the nice, dry warmness of my car. What if he thought I was trying to rob him and got all freaked out? When the rain started to get heavier, altruism got the better of my caution, and I asked him if he wanted to wait in my car.Good choice. What a cool guy.He was a cartographer from Seattle. A cartographer! For real.So that's my story. I met a cartographer. And I managed to get "Ghetto Supastar" stuck in his head. I heard him whistling it as I pulled away. Victory.I'm really all about the little things.P.S.&amp;gt; Merry Christmas to all!
