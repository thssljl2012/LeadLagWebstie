Here are some figures to snack on while we wait for 4pm ET.In 2005, the salary cap was $85.5 million dollars and that year's number one pick, quarterback Alex Smith, signed a 6-year, $49.5 million dollar contract that contained $24 million in guaranteed money. (That deal was also negotiated by Tom Condon)In 2006, the new CBA pushed the salary cap to $102M, an increase of 19.3%. The 1st pick of the 2006 NFL Draft was Mario Williams, a defensive end, who signed a six-year, $54 million dollar contract that contained $26.5 million in guarantees. This represented a 9.l% increase in total value and a 10.4% increase in guaranteed money over the deal that Smith signed the previous year.In 2007, the salary cap rose to $109M, an increase of 6.9%. The 1st pick of the 2007 NFL Draft was JaMarcus Russell, a quarterback, who signed a six-year, $61 million dollar contract that contained $29 million in guaranteed money. This represented a 13% increase in total value and a 9.4% increase in guaranteed money over the deal that Williams signed the previous year.In 2008, the salary rose to $116.7M, an increase of 7.1%.The 1st pick of the 2008 NFL Draft was Jake Long, a left tackle, who signed a 5-year, $57 million dollar contract that contained $30 million in guaranteed money. This represented a 6.6% decrease in total value and a 3.4% increase in guaranteed money. However, Long's contract was for five years, not six, so that's when you look at the per year averages. Long's deal averaged $11.4 million per years, a 12.1% increase over the $10.2M per year average Russell received the year before. Now, let's look at Stafford's deal.In 2009, the salary cap has risen to $127M, an increase of 9%. Stafford's six-year, $72M contract is a 26.3% increase over the total value of what Long received, and his guaranteed money is a 39% increase. From a "per year average" standpoint, though, it's only a 5.3% increase over Long's deal.A more accurate comparison would be the contract Matt Ryan signed as the #3 pick, but first quarterback chosen, in the 2008 NFL Draft. Stafford's deal could reportedly go as high as $78 million dollars, which is a modest 8.3% increase in the total value of Ryan's six-year, $contract. The guaranteed portion of the deal is 20.9% higher, which is where the shock value lies. Still, even if Stafford received a 7.7% increase in guaranteed money, which is the average increase the top pick has received in each of the three years since the latest CBA, which helped increase the salary cap by 48.8% over the last four years, was ratified, the Lions still would've been guaranteeing him $37.15 million dollars.And hey, what's an extra $4.55 million dollars amongst friends?
