*Sighs* Here we go again, no?  Sometimes I think I am destined to be round, and while I don't mind, I DO miss my muscle structure.So here goes weight loss/protein/weight lifting again.  Anyone that wants in on the filter, which I think is just Emily, let me know.  I will post periodic pictures if I am doing well, and a weight loss tracker as well.  Raven, no. Don't even ASK. Won't happen.  I have enough mental depression competing with fine ass Bulgarian women with thick black hair.  Don't need anymore pressure.  I don't want to be thin.  I want to be able to break people and defend me and mine.  So muscle structure is the goal here, not waist size or a number.Love you all.  Day one of the beginning.  My goals is to be able to bench press 180 by March.  I am currently at 95. (I know. PATHETIC)  I would LIKE to be able to bench press 225 by the end of 2009, if my regime allows me too.And, I have decided, to bite the bullet.  $53,200 for my bachelors from the University.  There is no price on education.  And if (please hear the word IF) the recession ends, the first people getting jobs will be educated ones.  And I plan on stomping a mud hole into the people working operations at Bank of America in two years, so I need the education.*Sighs* Debt is a bitch.
