I had a good day at work, getting some headway on several issues.Came home and was intending on getting some pictures taken or at least getting some work done on the flash sound trigger for high speed photos.  Instead, I killed my HD DirecTV receiver.  I got up to turn it off and ZAP! a huge spark flew from my finger to the on/off button and the unit began to reset.  The lights on the front seemed to look funny and by the time the unit was about halfway up the lights all went out.  Tried to use the remote and realized it wasn't communicating with the unit.  Tried to use the front panel buttons and none of them seems to be working correctly, I can't change the channel (I'm on 002 now) I can bring up the guide but I can't move to other stations.  I've totally reset the unit several times and even unplugged it for awhile before rebooting.  I did notice that it seems to be recording since the recording light was on about the time I went upstairs.Nicki made some good chicken and pasta with lime and I called my mom and talked with her since it was her birthday.  I should talk with her more, it seems dad always answers the phone though.  She's got a bunch of caterpillars in the aquarium and seems really excited to watch them come out as butterflies.Worked on the finances or really just got Quicken 2009 working, downloading my Bank of America stuff off the web.Never did get anything photographic done, just not enough hours in the day.
