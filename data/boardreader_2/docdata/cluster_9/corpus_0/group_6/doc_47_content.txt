When your a stranger.NO i am not listening to the Doors, just felt like writing that.Today : Hm... bit strange, had no phone till lunch time so yeah that sucks. As nothing is planned for tonight i wish i had my damn book to read, i cba with anything else. Although a film is a good idea.I got Four Brothers today, tempted... but i want to watch Friday the 13th part 3, i loved part 2,very good. I guess i'll wait till whenever i'm with the bitch. But yeah... ( Haha i'm guessing your reading you stalker n00b, so yeah. ) May watch The Untouchables or LOSER,who knows?Weekend is almost here, i gots a tattoo which i must look for what i roughly want, and print it out. AHH I USED AND after a COMMA!!!Friday night , i don't know what's happening.. drinking is a nono as my bus is at 10.30 or whatever.Drinking Jack and Coke at the moment, good stuff.
