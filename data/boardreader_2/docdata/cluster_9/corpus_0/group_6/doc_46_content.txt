Nana Kathie and Papa Sam came to visit on their way down to Texas where they plan to stay for the winter.  We had such a good time while they were here.  Nana was nice enough to go with Kyndal and me to CBA for two days.  She was a big helper to Ms. Sharon.  Unfortunately, I didn't think to take a picture.  She also went on a couple of bike rides with Rylan. Papa Sam was a sport and played Wii Guitar Hero. He also watched Rylan play game boy.  Not exactly entertaining to watch. He also looked at books with Kyndal. They spent 5 days and were on to visit more family and friends.  Looking forward to next time.
