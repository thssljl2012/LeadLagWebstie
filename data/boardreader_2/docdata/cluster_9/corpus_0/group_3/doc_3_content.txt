Up in Munroe Washington, a guy advertised on Craigslist for workers for a road maintenance project. The ad promised $28.50 an hour. Those who answered the ad were told to meet near the Bank of America in Monroe, at 11 a.m. on Tuesday. They were told to wear a yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask and, if possible, a blue shirt.About a dozen men showed up. Only there wasn't a job - instead the men were decoys.  A man dressed in the same outfit, including a respirator mask, assaulted an armored car guard with pepper spray and ran off with a bag of money.The robber fled on foot toward a nearby creek, and one witness said he floated away on a waiting inner tube.
