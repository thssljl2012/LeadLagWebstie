Creativity is often the elixir for our online activities. How often are you on the quest to make something viral? Well of course its not just PR practitioners and marketers who seek online creativity. Criminals are often very successful in the creative use of social media  and Im not talking about phishers or spammers here. How about this story about a robber in Monroe, Washington who used Craigslist to recruit loads of people to unwittingly act as decoys as he robbed a security truck But apparently, the robber had planned ahead. In case anyone was hot on his trail, he had at least a dozen unsuspecting decoys waiting nearby, which he recruited on Craigslist.  An armored car sits outside a Bank of America branch in Monroe, Wash. on Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2008. Police say a man tried to rob the car, then jumped into a creek that led to the Skykomish River. &amp;quot;I came across the ad that was for a prevailing wage job for $28.50 an hour,&amp;quot; said Mike, who saw a Craigslist ad last week looking for workers for a road maintenance project in Monroe.  He said he inquired and was e-mailed back with instructions to meet near the Bank of America in Monroe at 11 a.m. Tuesday. He also was told to wear certain work clothing.  &amp;quot;Yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask and, if possible, a blue shirt,&amp;quot; he said.   Some online marketing agency should snap him up. Via Boing Boing ShareThis
