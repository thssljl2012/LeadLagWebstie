...even accomplices to a bank robberyso a guy posts a craigslist ad telling people to show up dressed as a road construction worker outside of a bank of america branch at a specific time.  then robs the bank (wearing the same outfit of course) and makes his getaway down a creek (or crick if you're from downstate illinois) in an inner tube.  when the cops show up there's just a bunch of dudes hangin out by the bank that fully match the description.  pretty genius if you ask me.don't believe me?  read about it here.
