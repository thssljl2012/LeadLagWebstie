MONROE, Wash. -- Police here say a man who robbed an armored car driver at a bank Tuesday morning jumped into the Skykomish River on an inner tube to get away. Officers are searching the water and riverbank, and a Sheriff helicopter was circling the area, but so far there's no sign of the man. Police spokeswoman Debbie Willis said the man robbed an armored car driver at the Bank of America branch at 19917 Old Owen Road about 11 a.m. Mitch Ruth, who works across the street from the bank, said the robber sprayed the armored car driver with pepper spray and wrestled a bag of money away from the driver. The robber was wearing a surgical mask and wig, said Ruth, who tried to chase the man down but lost him in the woods. &amp;quot;He was a lot faster than I was,&amp;quot; Ruth said. Willis said an inner tube was recovered in the area. Investigators believe accomplices could have picked the robber up at a nearby boat launch or park.Picture at sauce is of confused-looking cops standing around an armoured vehicle, I'll spare you:Tub sauce
