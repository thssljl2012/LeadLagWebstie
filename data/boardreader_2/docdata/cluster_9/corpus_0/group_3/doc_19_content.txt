Stealing and assaulting a guy with pepper spray to do it is even more wrong.Stealing, assaulting a guy with pepper spray and then making a getaway in a novel fashion...blog-worthy!From the Seattle Times:Monroe police are searching for a man who robbed an armored-car guard this morning then fled with the money  down the Skykomish River on an inner tube.The robbery happened around 11 a.m. in the Bank of America parking lot at Old Owen Road and Highway 2, said Debbie Willis, department spokeswoman.The man watched as a security guard walked from the bank to the armored car with an undisclosed amount of cash in canvas bags, Willis said. He then confronted the guard and sprayed him with pepper spray.According to witnesses, the man then "grabbed ... the money and ran on foot to the river," Willis said. "He got into an inner tube and floated westbound."She said it was the first time she'd heard of that kind of getaway.Police have no leads so far but say it's possible the man had an accomplice waiting for him downriver.I love how the spokeman says it's the first time she'd hear of anyone using an inner-tube as a getaway vehicle.  I'd have been really impressed if she'd said it was the second or third time...
