 In 1999, the remake of &amp;quot;The Thomas Crown Affair,&amp;quot; an art thief wearing a trench coat and bowler hat made off with a priceless masterpiece from a museum as security guards are distracted by several lookalikes the crook hired.  Fast forward to Seattle, present day. A Craigslist advertisement offered $28.50 an hour for landscaping work. Several people applied. All were told to wear specific clothing - Yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask ... and, if possible, a blue shirt. And to meet in front of the Bank of America parking lot at 11:00 AM.  And so they did, non of them realizing that one of them was going to rob an armored truck that was pulling up in front of the bank. Witnesses watched as a security guard walked from the bank to the armored car with a large amount of cash in canvas bags. One of the blue shirted men then confronted the guard and sprayed him with pepper spray, grabbed the money and ran about 100 yards to Woods Creek.   Despite media reports that the robber made his escape floating down the creek in an inner tube, the Police do not believe that to be the case. There are places where the creek could be crossed on foot while other parts are deep enough to require a swim.   Either way, fiction and reality occupied the same space for a little while.
