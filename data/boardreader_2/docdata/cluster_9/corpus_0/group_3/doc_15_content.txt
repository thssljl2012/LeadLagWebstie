MONROE, Washington - An online advertisement offered $28.50 an hour to anyone who wore a blue, long-sleeved shirt, yellow safety vest, eye protection and ventilator mask and waited near a bank. Apparently, it should have been labeled "decoys wanted." Police said a number of people wearing the specified outfit were waiting near a Bank of America branch Tuesday when a similarly dressed man accosted a Brink's armored truck guard with pepper spray during a cash delivery in Monroe, a town about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Seattle.
