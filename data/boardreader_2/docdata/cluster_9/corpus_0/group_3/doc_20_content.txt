         ...or Keeler? A scheme in Seattle:I came across the ad that was for a prevailing wage job for $28.50 an hour, said Mike [Ruth], who saw a Craigslist ad last week looking for workers for a road maintenance project in Monroe. He said he inquired and was e-mailed back with instructions to meet near the Bank of America in Monroe at 11 a.m. Tuesday. He also was told to wear certain work clothing.   Yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask  and, if possible, a blue shirt, he said.  Mike showed up along with about a dozen other men dressed like him, but there was no contractor and no road work to be done. He thought they had been stood up until he heard about the bank robbery and the suspect who wore the same attire.  From there, the crook made his watery escape in a creek that dumps out into the Skykomish River. One witness said the robber swam away, but another said he used an inner tube to get away.   We did get an inner tube that was about 200 yards from the place where he entered the water and took that for evidence, said Debbie Willis, Monroe Police.University of Chicago Press(Via Levi; check out what Donald E.
