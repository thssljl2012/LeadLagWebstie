A creative bank robber in Washington State used CraigsList to hire a dozen unsuspecting accomplices for his heist of a Bank of America last week. The ad offered $28.50 per hour for maintenance workers who would show up near the bank wearing a blue shirt, yellow vest, safety goggles and respirator mask -- the exact same outfit the bank robber wore as he sprayed a guard with pepper spray, grabbed a bag of cash and then escaped by riding an inner tube down the Skykomish River.
