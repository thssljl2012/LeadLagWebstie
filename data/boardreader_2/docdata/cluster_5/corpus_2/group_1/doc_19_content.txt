 Andrew Symonds has been kicked out of the Austalian team for an undisclosed reason.      This sounds awful like the time Symonds wasn&amp;#039;t picked in the starting 11 vs. Bangladesh in Cardiff when we defeated them. Is this foreshadowing to the match to come?!? Let&amp;#039;s hope so.        http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ausv...ry/366892.html
