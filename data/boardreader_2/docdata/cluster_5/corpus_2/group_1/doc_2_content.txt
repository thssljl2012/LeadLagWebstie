Dhoni led his team to victory in the Commonwealth Bank series, took them to the final of the Asia Cup and is topping the averages for 2008. Obviously his average of 76.20 is boosted by not-outs, but his contribution to India has been invaluable.                      I disagree with that. Dhoni would surely make everyone world XI sides for his contributions to the team but the best batsman in the world? I highly doubt someone whos yet to have a substantial series outside of the subcontinent can be worthy of such adulation. Hes a very good player with many technical deficiencies that will inevitably mean that he will struggle to score prolifically away from home.

Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting haven&amp;#039;t played much in 2008, otherwise they would be challenging Dhoni strongly for the mantle while others like Sangakkara and Chanderpaul could do likewise. If Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers perform well in the upcoming ODI series their stocks will be boosted heavily.                      Im still not completely certain about Gambhir given that almost all of his success thus far has come against subcontinental sides or in the subcontinent, in both forms of the game. Again, best player in the world seems a little too soon           Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Perm                         To answer your question properly, who would I rather have in my team instead of Hayden, Ponting and Hussey? Personally only Ponting would make my current ODI side, if all players were fully fit, and my top seven would look like this.      Gambhir   Tendulkar   Ponting   de Villiers   Chanderpaul   Dhoni                      Ive spent about 10 minutes trying to understand how AB Devilliers has made your World XI. I know Im not one who watches a lot of ODI cricket these days, but I still have a pretty good feel for what is going on and I cannot honestly fathom how AB De Villiers is in ahead of Andrew Symonds. Even purely from a batting perspective, Symonds is easily a better player than half the players listed on that list let alone Devilliers. If there is a case for an Indian batsman in that side, then Id go for Yuvraj over Gambhir for reasons mentioned earlier and because Yuvraj has been little short of sensational over the last couple of years.       If Chanderpaul plays, Chanderpaul opens. Its easily the position hes been most effective in for his entire career and the only reason he bats down the order for the WI is because it provides more stability to the side and he can fulfill the role of being the team&amp;#039;s anchor.
