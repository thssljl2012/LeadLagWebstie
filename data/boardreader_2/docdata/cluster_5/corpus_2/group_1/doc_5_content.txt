       Quote:                         Australia v Bangladesh, 1st ODI, Darwin      Symonds sent home from Darwin      Cricinfo staff      August 30, 2008      Andrew Symonds has been sent home from Darwin ahead of Australia&amp;#039;s first one-day match against Bangladesh on Saturday and will take no part in the series. Late on Friday, Australia&amp;#039;s leadership group recommended to Cricket Australia that Symonds be ordered back to Brisbane.      A Cricket Australia spokesman did not elaborate on the exact reason for Symonds&amp;#039; departure, other than to say more details may be available after play on Saturday. The development is worryingly familiar for Symonds, who in 2005 was told not to play Bangladesh in Cardiff after turning up to the ground under the influence of alcohol.      Australia went on to lose that match, the only time they have been defeated by Bangladesh in an ODI. Michael Clarke, Australia&amp;#039;s stand-in captain for the Darwin series, was adamant on Friday that there was no chance Australia would take Bangladesh lightly again.      &amp;quot;I guarantee that definitely won&amp;#039;t happen,&amp;quot; Clarke said earlier in the day, before the Symonds decision was made. It leaves Australia with only 12 players available for the first one-day game at the Marrara Cricket Ground, although a replacement player will join the squad for the remaining two matches.                       This should be the second biggest upset of the century
