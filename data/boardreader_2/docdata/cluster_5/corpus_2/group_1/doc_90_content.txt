Bangladesh have no hope for anything and this new coach isn&amp;#039;t making anything better. Even the commentators payed out Bangladesh; this is what they said      &amp;quot;21 years after Sri Lanka started playing cricket they won their first World Cup, Bangladesh started playing in 1989 and they seem worse than they started.&amp;quot;      They said similar to what i have wrote as i can&amp;#039;t remember what they fully said.      Is Bangladesh ever honestly going to improve or will we just fail fail fail until Judgement Day comes
