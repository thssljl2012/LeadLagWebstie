I thought as there is no political government this time, there would be no problem for BTV to broadcast this series but still they couldn&amp;#039;t come out from their usual habits. Now where can we millions of Bangladeshi fans here watch this series? We also don&amp;#039;t have a very high speed internet connection in Bangladesh so that we can watch on the net, so it seems we have no hopes alive to watch this series.
