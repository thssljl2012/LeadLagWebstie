Ash should not overuse Mash...this is not good. I understand he is doing great but 8 overs straight. I think he will bring bowling change and Raz will bowl with Naz on the other end.  Shahadat may be coming over after Naz finishes his spell.  Raz and Shahadat overs will be very critical for this match and might turn out to be decider of this game.  If they can bowl decent Aussies won&amp;#039;t score 300+ runs. But I doubt looking at Shahdat&amp;#039;s initial overs and Raz&amp;#039;s recent performance.  Rafique was great as a first change bowler.
