If Hayden and Ponting had played and done well in the West Indies, or Tendulkar had played in the Asia Cup and scored runs then I would have adjusted my opinion on the issue. Basically I was just taking into account the past year or so, in which Dhoni has been very good.                      Fair enough, I guess I can sort of understand your reasoning now, just seems to me that &amp;#039;right now&amp;#039; is such a relative statement that it really doesnt make much sense to use it especially when you only consider an 8 month period.

Keep in mind he averaged 70 in that series against Vaas, Malinga, Muralitharan, Lee and Bracken while guiding India to a 2-0 victory in the finals. Aside from that series he has only played 22 ODIs outside the subcontinent (excluding teams that aren&amp;#039;t ODI standard), with only the 2007 Natwest Series and World Cup falling into the time frame I mentioned. Even though his average of 25 in England looks poor, he actually played a few good cameo&amp;#039;s at the end of India&amp;#039;s innings and helped level the series at the Oval.                      I dont think a few cameos is worthy of a tag such as being the best ODI batsman in the world. To date Dhoni has made most of his runs in the subcontinent. Hes a very good player but I would still be a little hesitant when rating his ability abroad.
