 We will not let it happen again       ANDREW ALOIA  August 30th, 2008       WORLD champion Australia is determined to ensure Darwin does not join Cardiff as an infamous one-day international destination.    The Welsh capital was the scene of minnows Bangladesh&amp;#039;s greatest one-day win when it upstaged the undisputed world powerhouse in 2005.  Three years on, back at another less renowned cricketing backdrop, the Tigers are once again in search of an upset against an Australian side rusted from six weeks of inactivity.  Stand-in Australian captain Michael Clarke, pained to be reminded of the ghost of Cardiff past, yesterday vowed not to under-estimate Bangladesh and risk repeating the mistake.  &amp;quot;I can guarantee that definitely won&amp;#039;t happen,&amp;quot; he said.   &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s happened to us before and we&amp;#039;ve lost, not just to Bangladesh, but to a lot of teams.  &amp;quot;As soon as you take things for granted I think you find yourself asking questions why you&amp;#039;ve lost that game, so it&amp;#039;s important we concentrate on Saturday. From that day (in Cardiff) we learned not to take anything for granted.&amp;quot;  Bangladesh cricket coach Jamie Siddons, a former Australian one-day international, sees reason to be optimistic heading into the first match of the three game series at TIO Stadium today after Australia laboured to get the better of the AIS XI in its only hit-out on Wednesday.  &amp;quot;It was typical Australia apart from the batting, which I though was a little bit rusty (and) which I expect to be rusty still,&amp;quot; Siddons said.   On an inconsistent TIO Stadium wicket, Siddons hopes the demons of Cardiff come back to haunt the world champions.  &amp;quot;In that (Cardiff) game, I remember it pretty well, the pitch played a few tricks early,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We won the toss and bowled so hopefully there is something similar in this pitch.&amp;quot;  As the only lead-in event to Australia&amp;#039;s tour of India in October and at a time that Clarke (pictured) is trying to certify his billing as future full-time Australian captain he needs not remind the team of the importance of the competition.  &amp;quot;There are a lot of guys trying to cement a spot in this team so there is a lot to play for,&amp;quot; Clarke said.  &amp;quot;For me this is my opportunity to show the way I want to lead Australia.&amp;quot;      http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/200...6_ntsport.html
