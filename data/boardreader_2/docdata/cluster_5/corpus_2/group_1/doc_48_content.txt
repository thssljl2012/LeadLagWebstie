It is Ten sports and they are showing it.                                          I know Ten Sports is showing the series between Srilanka and India. But star cricket will be busy showing other India matches, for example t20 WC or Asia Cup or maybe even some old Indian matches. So no reason hoping on them to show the series, lets instead hope that super sports will broadcast it.
