commentators spot on, aside from a 5 bad overs (2 from shahadat, 2 from Alok, 1 really Bad one from nazmul) gets them above 250. otherwise, Bangladesh did reasonably well with the ball  and i like Ashraful&amp;#039;s captaincy too...      if those 5 bad overs were as excellent as others...they would have been close to 228.      I hope Ashraful does something special with the bat today... Whatever the result it is not in your hands...but your effort and concentration, you can choose. it is not impossible but difficult.         Mortaza: the new Rasel??
