      Quote:                          Sachin Tendulkar will not be playing in the five-ODI series in Sri Lanka        , after sustaining an injury to his left elbow during the ongoing third Test in Colombo. S Badrinath, the Tamil Nadu batsman, is likely to be his replacement.    &amp;amp;quot;I spoke to Sachin and the team physio [Nitin Patel] this morning and I can confirm that Tendulkar has been ruled out of action for two to three weeks,&amp;amp;quot; Ratnakar Shetty, the BCCI&amp;#039;s chief administrative officer, told Cricinfo.    Tendulkar had jarred his elbow while attempting a catch in the 47th over of Sri Lanka&amp;#039;s first innings on Saturday, and was quickly taken off. An MRI scan revealed a swelling, and Tendulkar didn&amp;#039;t take the field for the rest of the innings. However, he did bat in India&amp;#039;s second innings on Sunday, though two places below his customary No. 4 position. Tendulkar was out for 14, which still leaves him 77 short of surpassing Brian Lara as the leading run-getter in Tests.    No replacement has been confirmed as yet, though Badrinath is the frontrunner. &amp;amp;quot;I believe that the possibility of Badrinath being sent as a replacement is being discussed. But that&amp;#039;s not 100% final, as of now,&amp;amp;quot; Shetty said. &amp;amp;quot;We have been informed by the physio that Sachin has been ruled out for the remainder of the series, and there is a good possibility of Badrinath being sent as a replacement,&amp;amp;quot; a national selector said.    The five-match series will be played from August 18-29.    Tendulkar had missed the Asia Cup in Pakistan due to a groin injury, and had been named in the ODI squad for Sri Lanka as well as the Champions Trophy in Pakistan which takes place in September. His last one-day match was the second final of the Commonwealth Bank Series against Australia in Brisbane in March 2008.                     1 character
