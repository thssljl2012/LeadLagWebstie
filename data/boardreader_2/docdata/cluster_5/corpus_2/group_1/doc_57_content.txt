That last over from Rajib was truly a gem. He is definitely a much better slog-overs bowler than he is an opener. I fail to understand why he can&amp;#039;t tune his bowling to keep his length tighter in the earlier overs.    This being a Friday night ahead of a long weekend definitely helps people in Canada to stay up and watch the batting all through to the end.
