Well, after seeing Australia&amp;#039;s performance against AIS a few days ago, I think we might just have a chance. Australians team bowled out for 177 (AIS bowled out for 123) - we managed more than that in each one our 4 outings. Its time for our lTigers to eat this big kangaroo alive!       http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausvb...ch/366581.html
