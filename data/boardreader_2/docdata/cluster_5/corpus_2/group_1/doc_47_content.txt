Not all the players will be firing all cylinders,, you cant expect that.. had that been the case, we wouldve been an Australian team. If Shahadat is not clicking today,, thats fine as long as it is only him and the rest of the 10 players click a bit... But I think Shahadat will come back with vengence..
