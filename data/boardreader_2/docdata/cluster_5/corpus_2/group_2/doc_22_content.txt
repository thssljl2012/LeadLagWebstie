Just like he did in the last Ashes series after he got hit by a 110km/h Thunderbolt from McGrath &amp;amp;amp; had to go home.                      Barry, that was  after  the Ashes series and in the Commonwealth Bank Series (which the Aussies have only just won - v Bangladesh!).      Give him some credit - he did last the Ashes series.   Give him some brickbats - he was hit trying to slog &amp;#039;old man McGrath&amp;#039;.
