                    Re: Underrated Teams/Sports People - Thoughts                                             Commonwealth Bank Trophy netballers and more specifically, our national team.      They are no.2 in the world yet, have a superior strike rate to most other internatonal sides recognised by IFNA netball's world governing body.      Anyone here a netball fan ?
