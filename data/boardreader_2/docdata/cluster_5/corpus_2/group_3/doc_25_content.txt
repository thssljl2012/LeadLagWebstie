      I never liked any of these movies. The first one had Danny Glover so points for that but meh. I remember Saw and Hostel came out around the same time and I liked Hostel a lot more. I&amp;#039;ve only seen 1 and 2 though. Cba to watch the others.                                              __________________             Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  CrazyChris576                         Not all of us can live at home in our parents&amp;#039; basements until we&amp;#039;re 30, dude.
