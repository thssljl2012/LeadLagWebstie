  quote:   ORIGINAL: The Lensman       As for Collingwood - I dont think he&amp;#039;s good enough and if you can find details of the last 20 matches and prove to me that he&amp;#039;s worth to be in the side then ill think of changing my mind, but from my memory, 1 noteable innings to think comes to mind...............            In Collingwood&amp;#039;s last 20 ODI innings, he has hit five 50&amp;#039;s, 4 of which were quick fire unbeaten&amp;amp;nbsp;50&amp;#039;s. When Collingwood hit 2 back to back centuries and a&amp;amp;nbsp;50&amp;amp;nbsp;in Australia last year to&amp;amp;nbsp;win the Commonwealth Bank Series, he was lauded as one of England&amp;#039;s most underrated players ever! It&amp;#039;s a shame that when England do poorly his name is always mentioned for the chop. He&amp;#039;ll prove his worth again and will fail with the bat again, so unfortunately we&amp;#039;ll see this same cycle many other times before the end of his career.      Prior is a shit opener who really doesn&amp;#039;t seem to know what his role is. Score quickly you moron. I&amp;#039;d bat him at 7, at least then he&amp;#039;d know to come in and smack it and rid us of that confused look on his face at the top of the order. I think the mistake to not select Foster will be even more blatant come the Test matches.      I agree with Goodfella that Denly should be given a try. I think Gambhir has proven the worth of a specialist opener in all formats of the game.              &amp;amp;lt; Message edited by  dh_19  --  18/11/2008 1:33:07 PM   &amp;amp;gt;
