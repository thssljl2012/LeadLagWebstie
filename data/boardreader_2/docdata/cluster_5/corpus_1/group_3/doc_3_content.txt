 By STEPHEN PHIRIUNEVENLY yoked teams go to battle today with defending champions Zesco United facing Forest Rangers in a Ndola derby as the second edition of the Barclays Cup kicks off in four provinces.In what is a novel arrangement, organisers of the competition have spread matches in Southern, Lusaka, Central and the Copperbelt provinces in line with their theme "Think Football, Think Barclays." In double-header extravaganzas, Nakambala Stadium in Mazabuka will host matches between Young Arrows and first division side Nakambala Leopards and Green Buffaloes who will face second division Kascol Rangers.In Lusaka, Red Arrows have an easy-looking tie against Division Two (Midlands) Paramilitary while Division One (South) Riflemen lie in wait for Kabwe Warriors at Nkoloma Stadium.Zanaco start their campaign against Division One (North) Zamtel while Lusaka Dynamos have a date against Nchanga Rangers in an all-Super Division contest at Railway Grounds in Kabwe.The last set of matches will be held at Nchanga Stadium in Chingola where Zesco will be up against Forest and Kalulushi Modern Stars will take on Power Dynamos.The teams are battling it out for the K125 million which is the top prize for the competition which is the richest on the local football calendar, thanks to sponsors Barclays Bank Zambia.FOREST vs ZESCO (15:00 hours)Both teams are leading the log in their respective divisions.Zesco are pacesetters in the Super Division while Forest are at the summit of Division One (North).This is proof enough that the game could go either way.Zesco coach Wedson Nyirenda knows what is at stake and has already plotted Forest's downfall.Last year, Zesco beat Forest 2-0 in a league game at Trade Fair ground but lost the reverse fixture 0-1.Nyirenda will look up to Jonas Sakuwaha, Lottie Phiri, Clifford Chipalo and Innocent Mwaba to send Forest to the cleaners. "We are ready, eager to defend the Barclays Cup title. We need the trophy on our shelves," Nyirenda said. He said the 7-6 penalty loss to Forest in the Edwin Mbaso Memorial tournament in July this year was an itchy part on his team and their opponents should expect a good hiding.But Forest know Zesco's strengths and weaknesses and will seek to capitalise on them "I have a bunch of players who on their day can deliver. We are ready for Zesco and may the better team win," said Forest coach Mathews Njovu.Njovu, a former Kabwe Warriors winger, draws his confidence from his team's hunger for success.Under-20 striker Alex Mwiche, Bizwell Phiri Junior, Frazer Mwewa and Kameta Mutambo will offer a good challenge to Nyambe Mulenga-anchored Zesco backline.NAKAMBALA vs Y/ARROWS (15:00 hours)Young Arrows' coach Alfred Mulao's dream of grabbing silverware continues when his team squares it off with Nakambala.Arrows are already in the BP Top Eight semi-finals and Mulao will rely on Judge Mkandawire, Chiwanki Lyainga, Chomba Ng'andwe, Krugger Mwansa and Shaft Katuka to confine Nakambala to the wrong end of the result.But Linekar Mwikisa, Nixon Chilundika and Kelvin Bweupe have the ability to lead Nakambala to greater heights. ZAMTEL vs ZANACO (12:30 hours)After scoring a classic goal against Green Buffaloes in the BP Top Eight quarter-finals, international Henry Banda is expected to lead Zanaco against Zamtel at Railway Grounds.Banda, who is slowly establishing himself into a cult hero, holds the key to Zanaco's success. His precise passing could create space for Rodger Kola, Ignatius Lwipa and Nasha Kaaya to find the target.But Zamtel, chasing promotion to the Super Division could unleash the unthinkable if given chance.DYNAMOS vs RANGERS (15:00 hours)Nchanga Rangers nudged Lusaka Dynamos 2-1 in a Super Division Week 12 match.With veteran Elijah Tana anchoring the defence, Boyd Chanda keeping the midfield afloat and Matthews Mecha hunting for goals, Rangers coach Kenneth "Bubble" Malitoli is assured of victory.On the Super Division log, Rangers have 29 points, three better than Dynamos.But Dynamos will seek revenge with Hichani Himoonde, William Njobvu and Josephat Nkhoma being the main men for coach Fighton Simukonda.KASCOL vs BUFFALOES (13:00 hours)Having been booted out of the BP Top Eight, Green Buffaloes will shift their attention to the Barclays Cup and will use all their might to trample Kascol.Buffaloes lost 0-1 to Zanaco in the BP Top Eight quarter-finals.Coach George Lwandamina has a winning team in Sebastian Mwansa, Morgan Hanjema, John Musukwa and Reuben Tembo.But football being a funny odd game, Kascol could embarrass Buffaloes. RIFLEMEN vs WARRIORS (15:00 hours)Warriors are favoured to progress to the Barclays Cup quarter-finals as they face Riflemen at Nkoloma Stadium in Lusaka.But Warriors, who will be missing the services of star striker Emmanuel Mayuka who is in Israel attending trials with Maccabi Haifa, need to sharpen the frontline if they are to avoid an early exit from the competition.With K125 million for the winners, there is reason to play the best football.Elsewhere, Division Two (North) Kalulushi Modern Stars will engage Power Dynamos in an early kick-off at Nchanga Stadium in Chingola while Paramilitary will date Red Arrows at 12:30 hours at Nkoloma Stadium in Lusaka.
