A stylish century by Lisa Sthalekar was the highlight of the Commonwealth Bank Southern Stars' thumping 86-run win over India at the Sydney Cricket Ground here Saturday.  The victory gives the Commonwealth Bank Southern Stars a 2-0 lead in the five-match series with India never looking to overhaul the home team's total of 6-215. Sthalekar (104 not out, 113 balls) was again in imposing form and she scored her second one-day international century with a perfectly-timed innings that stole the initiative from India.  After being sent into bat, the Southern Stars' total was built around a 93-run fifth-wicket stand between Sthalekar and Jodie Fields. The two came together in the 30th over at 83 for four after rain disrupted the game for a while.  Once settled, the two scored at six runs an over to put the home team in a strong position. Sthalekar's century was her highest score in one-day internationals and in the process she has also reached 2000 runs in the One-Dayers, the fourth Australian woman to reach the milestone.  The India innings never got off with tight bowling and suffocating fielding limiting them to 23 from the first 15 overs. Without an attacking intent to India's batting, the Southern Stars' attack was able to dictate. Kirsten Pike finished with 3-29.  The third match in the series will be played at North Sydney Oval on Wednesday, the fourth and fifth matches at Manuka Oval in Canberra wilk be played Nov 8 and Nov 9 respectively.
