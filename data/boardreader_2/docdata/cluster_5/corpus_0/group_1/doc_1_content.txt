 There have been tears and recriminations today over a pair of trousers. They were unpicked so often that I've scraped half the skin off my left index finger with the unpicker.BUT. They're done now, and it only took one great moment of "WHY DO WE DO THIS TO OURSELVES" to restart the cosplay systems. So worry ye not, Edgeworth is happening, and he has a natty pair of trousers.Still to do:Sew on other lapelDecorate lapelsTake in waistcoatDecorate waistcoatMake jabotBalthy: Other sleeve, cuffs, badges, buttonholes, bits'n'bobs, finish painting belt, ARMBANDTira: Fix feathers on betterFix weapon where possibleAnd possibly maybe perhaps potentially do a pair of Spike trousers, since I actually have a clue about making trousers now. I clearly have large issues with fly zips.Oh, and I didn't mention it earlier. I discovered that Balthasar has TWO OUTFITS. Oh yes. Oh mighty THORES and your inconsistency! I leave my sanity at your great altar! I went for the fancier one but I'm not decorating the scarf, because cba. It's prettier than the tie version.STUFF TO BRING TO AME:COSTUMES WOULD BE A STARTPW1 for NikkiTop Hat for KatTB DVD cover for EmmaGift for Lulu RoseAJ for AngieMoney for Andrew's shootTHINK that's it...
