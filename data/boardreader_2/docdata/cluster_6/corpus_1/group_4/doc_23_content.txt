Jon Walters says he is confident of realising his dream of playing in the Premier League with Ipswich.  Jim Magilton's men made it eight points from four games - extending their run to just one defeat in 11 Championship games - with a 2-0 win over QPR on Saturday.  And Walters, who last week signed a new contract to stay at Ipswich until 2012, believes the hard work behind the scenes is starting to pay dividends.  He told the Gazette: 'I came to this football club to reach the Barclays Premier League.  'And with the manager and coaches we've got, there's so much work going on behind the scenes to make sure we're heading in the right direction.  'We've taken eight points from four games, which is promotion form, and we're now hard to beat.  'It would have been nice to have turned some of the draws into wins, but remaining unbeaten has bolstered confidence.'
