Blackburn striker Benni McCarthy has been ruled out of the Barclays Premier League match against Sunderland tomorrow at Ewood Park because of a family bereavement.  Roque Santa Cruz is pushing for a place in the starting line-up after scoring in midweek in the Carling Cup victory against the same opponents after recovering from a hamstring strain.  Andre Ooijer is also in contention following a knee problem but Keith Andrews remains doubtful with a similar injury.  Provisional squad: Robinson, Brown, Simpson, Ooijer, Samba, Nelsen, Khizanishvili, Olsson, Warnock, Mokoena, Andrews, Tugay, Treacy, Pedersen, Roberts, Derbyshire, Villanueva, Santa Cruz, Fowler.
