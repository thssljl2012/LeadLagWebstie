Andy Johnson insists he relishes playing alongside Bobby Zamora and is backing his Fulham strike partner to rediscover the scoring touch. Johnson paid back a chunk of his 10.5million transfer fee by firing the Cottagers to a 2-0 victory over Wigan on Wednesday night, his first goals for the club. Zamora has not added to the brilliant solitary strike that opened his account against Bolton in mid-September and pressure on the pair was growing until the victory against Steve Bruce's side. Fulham spent 16million assembling their new strikeforce and Johnson believes Zamora's contribution so far has been invaluable. 'Bobby is a fantastic player to play with. He is top-class. All you've got to do is look at his performances over the last three or four weeks,' he said. 'I know he hasn't scored much but neither had I until Wednesday. He is fantastic to play alongside and he will definitely score goals. 'He's a top-quality player, he scores goals every single day in training - fantastic goals as well - so he's a pleasure to play alongside. 'He should take the credit against Wigan because he did a lot of my work as well.' The pair will be reunited for tomorrow's Barclays Premier League clash with Everton - their third game in eight days - with Johnson claiming they have yet to receive the rewards they deserve. 'We have played well in every game, but we have been unlucky,' he said. 'We've had a couple of chances each over the last four or five games and it just hasn't quite happened for us. 'There were a couple of good saves from Paul Robinson at Blackburn and Bobby has skimmed the post here and there. It's just a bit of luck and it takes a bit of time. 'We've only played five and a half games together now so it's going to take time, but Bobby is a pleasure to play alongside.' Johnson will play his first match against Everton since returning to London over the summer with a warning from boss Roy Hodgson not kiss the Fulham badge. Wayne Rooney infuriated Toffees fans by making the gesture last weekend and Hodgson believes it is wise to avoid any possible incitement. Johnson hopes he will be given a warm reception tomorrow and insists he left the club on good terms. 'I care about how the fans will react to me because I spent two years there. I'm not a heartless person,' he said. 'I feel as if I did everything right with the way I moved. I feel I've done everything right with Everton. 'I was there for two years and I'm looking forward to going back there. 'But the biggest thing for Fulham is to get more points. We are in confident form and we can take confidence from beating Wigan.'
