 Crap paper games often turn out to be great entertainment though. I think they had Bolton v Villa on TV years ago which hardly looked a mouthwatering tie and it ended up being a superb match whereas games you expect to be great often turn out dull.  I remember watching Pompey v Reading on MOTD last year with one of the most boring commentators I&amp;#039;ve ever heard, they obviously thought it was going to be shit but it ended up finishing 7-4.
