   quote   Sam     Maybe the smile is because it is actual good news for the club, means they will make more money to put into the club.   True.  But Levy&amp;#039;s a *bleep*, he will just pocket the money, knew that Berbatov leaves and doesn&amp;#039;t buy a better replacement, so we are left with 3 shit strikers, 2 are championship at best.
