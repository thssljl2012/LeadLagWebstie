          If we don&amp;amp;#039;t have to deal with international fatigue, which we may have to, keeping the ball on the ground should neutralize Wigan&amp;amp;#039;s strengths. When Man City played them, Wigan couldn&amp;amp;#039;t get to the ball. We played well against City (2nd half), so we just have to do the same. And we should be very weary of set pieces, because they can dominate us in the air.
