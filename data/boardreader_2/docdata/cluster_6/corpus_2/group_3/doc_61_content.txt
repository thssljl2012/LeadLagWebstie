     quote  Sonny RFC    What is it with all these billionaires taking over Premiership clubs? As if these clubs aint well off enough and don&amp;#039;t get enough of Rupert Murdoch&amp;#039;s money...  well, spurs have been owned by Joe Lewis for years, his estimated wealth is a few billion, where do you think all this money comes from?? but i suppose when the very richest people in the world are buying Man City and the likes (no offence to city) its weird. What about that lot at QPR! they were probably the smartest cos it cost them *bleep* all to buy them, but how long is it going to take them to get success. Sky Sports, Rupert Murdoch and The Premier League made football all about money. Its never going to change.
