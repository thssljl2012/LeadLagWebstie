  I thought Id get the ball rolling with my predictions ..  Blackburn 1-1 Man Utd - Utd are always prone to a slip after European adventures. Sunderland 0-2 Arsenal - Comfortable win here. West Brom 1-2 Fulham - West Brom will be unable to string 2 results together Im afraid.  Wigan 2-0 Middlesbrough - Wigan look very impressive at times, hopefully this will be one of their better days. Chelsea 2-2 Aston Villa - Tough game in mid week &amp;amp; injuries will be enough for Chelsea to drop a few points. Everton 0-1 Newcastle - Big 6 pointer, confidence is rock bottom at both clubs. Everton going out 2nite will not help things   Man City 0-1 Liverpool - close game, hopefully our match winners will see us through.  Portsmouth 3-0 Stoke - I think Stoke will open up a little more here &amp;amp; get punished for it!  Tottenham 2-0 Hull - I cant see Tottenham dropping yet more points here.  West Ham 3-1 Bolton - Hard fought victory for West Ham here, with a late goal making it look more comfortable than it was.   That should spark some debate ...
