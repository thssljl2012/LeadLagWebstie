 What about Joe Cole ?    Anyway I&amp;#039;m sure Chelsea will still have a side good enoough to beat Middlesbrough though I want them to loose.    Cudicini  Ferreira Alex ??? Bridge         Mikel              Ballack     Lampard  J.Cole ? -------------         Malouda            Anelka     Still I think that team should be good enough to win the game despite the injuries.   Edit : Just noticed Terry is injured aswell , I think Middlesbrough have every chance of winning this one now , unless Terry plays.
