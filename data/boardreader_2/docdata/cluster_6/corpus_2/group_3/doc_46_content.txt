   quote   Andy_Jay1987     So because I dont post my opinion daily I dont have one.  I didn&amp;#039;t say that. I said often. Hence I&amp;#039;d take you a bit more seriously if you actually posted your opinion a bit more often.     quote  The fact that I&amp;#039;m not on neo every hour of every day means I dont have an opinion?   Did I say that? Nope.    quote  A pop at something arsenal related? I constantly slate my own team. I rarely take a pop at arsenal, I only do it when provoked.  So it&amp;#039;s fine for you to do that when you&amp;#039;re provoked, but when I am, it&amp;#039;s not acceptable and I&amp;#039;m a simpleton.    quote  I dont know what your problem is, you are apparently opinionated and bloody minded but have to attack me for the same thing? Jesus Wept and Died.  Are you trying to say that you&amp;#039;re opinionated and bloody minded? Haha, no; you&amp;#039;re just stupid and incorrect      quote   Andy_Jay1987       quote   Delexo     Andy_Jay1987 you were the guy who thought the end of October was October 1st so your opinion is automatically void.   You cant take a bit of sarcasm, you said &amp;quot;tell me this in october&amp;quot; and october is october, whatever man, you have Simon Amstell as your avatar and cant take sarcasm.    Haha    Oh and for the record, Amstell is hilarious.
