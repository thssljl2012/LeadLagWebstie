   quote   Delexo     Andy_Jay1987 you were the guy who thought the end of October was October 1st so your opinion is automatically void.   You cant take a bit of sarcasm, you said &amp;quot;tell me this in october&amp;quot; and october is october, whatever man, you have Simon Amstell as your avatar and cant take sarcasm.  anyway:  Fair play to Hull if they do beat us. They should stay up on merit now, they dont deserve relegation, Just like Wigan when they came up, no fear and playing their own game, its good to see it, same as Reading.
