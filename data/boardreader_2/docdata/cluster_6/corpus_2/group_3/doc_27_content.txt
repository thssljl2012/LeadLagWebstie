   quote  stefan1888    WTF IS SKY SPORTS SHOWING THE NEWCASTLE GAME OVER THE MAN CITY-LIVERPOOL GAME OR CHELSEA-VILLA GAME?  I said the exact same thing recently     quote  sweenEy    Crap paper games often turn out to be great entertainment though  The Man City v Liverpool match will be an open attacking football match if Man City play the way they played against Chelsea a few weeks back because that match was brilliant with end-to-end football     quote  stefan1888    orite yeh its st. mirren-rangers, hopefully watch that and watch rangers get humped  No chance mate
