 Ah, Stealth. Did you know Ben Sahar&amp;#039;s being called up to Israeli Army today? Well so i&amp;#039;m told anyways. Abit of a strange loan signing if they had know Sahar had to go into the army at 18 (Every Israeli does, i think). I don&amp;#039;t know how long he&amp;#039;s gotta serve though.
