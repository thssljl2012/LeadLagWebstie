            Quote from: Dr Cornwallis on October 10, 2008, 11:11:08 AM   18 Oct, 2008 Wigan Athletic Barclays Premier League H&amp;amp;nbsp;  Pepe, Degen, Hyypia, Agger, Dossena, Lucas, Alonso, Pennant, Keane, Babel, Torres   But Lucas will also come back late. It&amp;amp;#039;s going to be an Alonso/Gerrard CM (assuming they both come back fit, please God), so pretty much a Stoke setup with Agger in for Skrtel.
