          This is how i think next games will pan out: 18 Oct, 2008 Wigan Athletic Barclays Premier League H&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;- win,anything else is unthinkable 22 Oct, 2008 Atletico Madrid Champions League&amp;amp;nbsp; A&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; - draw 26 Oct, 2008 Chelsea Barclays Premier League A&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;-draw, 29 Oct, 2008 Portsmouth Barclays Premier League H&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;- win,got to win our home games 01 Nov, 2008 Tottenham Hotspur Barclays Premier League A&amp;amp;nbsp; -win,still a hard game though 04 Nov, 2008 Atletico Madrid Champions League H&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;-win,could seal our qualification 08 Nov, 2008 West Brom Barclays Premier League H&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; -win,should be 3 points 12 Nov, 2008 Tottenham Hotspur Carling Cup A&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;-draw,expect a young side 15 Nov, 2008 Bolton Wanderers Barclays Premier League A&amp;amp;nbsp; -win,not a great record at bolton though Looking at these games they all,with the exception of chelsea,look very winable.I&amp;amp;#039;d be very disappointed to come awy with less than 15-16 points,especially taking into the opposition we play at home.It would be great to put the champs league group to bed also.
