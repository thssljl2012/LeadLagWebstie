 I hate international breaks    As long as Torres is back in time to play Chelsea then it shouldn&amp;#039;t be too much of a problem, we really should be fine against Wigan without him, and although the Madrid game will be tough I&amp;#039;m still sure that we can get a result if he misses the game. We will definately need him to be back against Chelsea though, huge game with a lot riding on it.
