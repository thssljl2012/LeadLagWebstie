   quote   The Realest     So what would happen if Terry got injured for a year, then came back and took his time to get into his stride, would you be calling for Alex to be in the team instead of him?     Look, the reason that I chose to target Neville is that Brown has surpassed him in practical purposes.  Also, the Terry-Alex one isn&amp;#039;t practical, since they have only a two year age difference, so one can replace the other at some point.  And if Alex was performing even better than Terry was, who wouldn&amp;#039;t put him on? Brown &amp;amp;gt; Neville is all I&amp;#039;m saying, but how Man U fans keep wanting him in their team needs to stop because it&amp;#039;s become obvious.
