  *Awaits people to say &amp;quot;Middlesbrough will be relegated&amp;quot; after just one game.*  My god we played like shit. That had to be the worse game I&amp;#039;ve seen from my team at the Riverside. They just allowed Chelsea to play and score goals like if we were cannon-fodder!  And why did Southgate bring in John Johnson? My god! This is a top 4 team and we bring a teenager in! Why did O&amp;#039;Neil play? He&amp;#039;s just been awful for the last 5 games!  Game to forget! I was expecting a loss but not a cricket score and a terrible performance!
