   quote   RizzyJay      Dammit, why did I take Anelka off for Rooney in my fantasy team. Rooney has done nothing according to goals since last week. Anelka scored 3  .    Anelka still crap, mind. All he scores are tap-in.    Lampard please score a hat-trick for my fantasy team  .      At the end of a day a goal is a goal. It can be a magnificant goal or a scrappy one but aslong as it hits the back of the net and it&amp;#039;s not offside I&amp;#039;m not complaining.
