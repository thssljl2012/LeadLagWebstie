   quote   SuperCesc07       quote   g_lfc     Why edit one of your posts &amp;amp; then post again anyway?   Its looking more &amp;amp; more of a gimme as the days go by for Utd unfortunatly. Hopefully Arsenal can grab a draw though.   Ur saying arsenal have basically no chance of winning?     Dont laugh, if you keep playing the way you have been, injuries and bookings aside, your gonna lose a lot more games this year.  Arsenal are the 13th most fouled team in the league and commit the least amount of fouls. thats quite funny  considering the whole complaint of having no heart, teams with heart, tackle.
