 Stoke City, Hull City, Tottenham Hotspurs, Fulham FC, Sunderland, Arsenal&amp;#039;s nightmares!  Alright, I say they need to readjust their tactics a little and get a very good win against a team to start going again and unfortunately I hope we&amp;#039;re not that &amp;quot;team&amp;quot;  . I remember 2-3 years back I made a complete fool of myself here with my comments, so this time I won&amp;#039;t underestimate Arsenal.   quote   WENGER GET YOUR *bleep*ING ACT TOGETHER OR LEAVE.   OMG angry people! Show some support man. It&amp;#039;s just temporary!
