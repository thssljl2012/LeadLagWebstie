   Arsenal 0 - 2 Man United    With suspensions and injuries at Arsenal, I feel United will put them to the sword and really turn on the heat. Ronaldo and Rooney to get the goals.     Liverpool 1 - 1 West Brom    A tricky side, Liverpool will either put 5 on them or they&amp;#039;ll draw. And, as I&amp;#039;m a United fan, I&amp;#039;m going for a draw. Gerrard on the scoresheet for Liverpool and Brunt for Albion.
