 I aint too worried about Blackurn, like Terry said the game against roma could be the kick up the arse we need. Showing we don&amp;#039;t just turn up, win, then go home. Can see it being another run away if the first goal is scored in the first half. Would like to see:   Mikel Lampard - Deco J.Cole Anelka - Drogba   Or maybe having Anelka playing abit more of a wing position.
