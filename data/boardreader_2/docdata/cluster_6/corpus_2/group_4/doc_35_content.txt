It will come down as to whether the other teams can figure out exactly how to stop Delap&amp;#039;s long throws. Other then that and Fuller, they dont offer much.     Fulham look a bit shaky. They have a good CM in Murphy and Bullard, but it tends to fall away from there. Bullard will need to play out of his skin and stay fit for them to survive again.     Bolton no-one cares.     Newcastle will be fine once they get rid of Ameobi. Either by playing two small guys up front in Owen and Martins or the return of Viduka. Barton is the x factor.     Plenty of others as well such as WBA and Wigan who are candidates     There are still a lot of relegation candidates, given how close the league currently is. Even the mid table sides would have some cause for concern...                      Hey man, I&amp;#039;m glad you asked because I was ****ing smashed(er) when I wrote that. I&amp;#039;m gonna stand by Fulham and Bolton. Bolton are just SHITE and have no hope. When your star player is Kevin Nolan, you are in for a long year (at least in the past they had Anelka and Diouf). Too many Americans for Fulham and just don&amp;#039;t have the quality required to stay up.     I say Newcastle not because I think they will go down, but because I hope they will. I am probably sucked in from Stoke&amp;#039;s performance against Arsenal a bit too. WBA and WIgan are capable of going down, but I think Zaki should be enough to keep Wigan up...  He is better then Owen, Martins/Viduka. WBA and Newcastle could fight it out... Blackburn too if Santa Cruz is sold in January. Alot of variables atm, probably too early to predict even though I did (I&amp;#039;m confident in 2 at least). Spurs will finish mid table though.
