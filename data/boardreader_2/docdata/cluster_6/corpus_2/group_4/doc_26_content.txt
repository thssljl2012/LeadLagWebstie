   quote   The Realest     It just said on SSN that Scolari has another injury now, who got injured today then?   Ashley Cole, but we&amp;#039;ve got Bridge to step in  . But we don&amp;#039;t have any hard fixtures coming up any time soon apart from Roma so i don&amp;#039;t think thats big of a blow. Did it say how long he was out for?
