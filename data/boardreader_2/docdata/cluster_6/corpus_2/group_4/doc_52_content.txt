   quote   Will       quote  So how does that make your finishing any better than ours? Or indeed, ours not better than yours?  Where exactly did I say Liverpool&amp;#039;s finishing was better than Tottenham&amp;#039;s? You finished one of your chances, as did Liverpool. So, how exactly is anyones finishing better than the other?   I didn&amp;#039;t say that. I was referring to your post to do with the current discussion. I wasn&amp;#039;t speculating your posts context, but it&amp;#039;s value to the discussion, i apologize if you thoguht otherwise. Of which was  Tottenham&amp;#039;s finishing was better than Liverpool&amp;#039;s which statistics prove. We had less shots, i think, didn&amp;#039;t watch the whole game, but scored a goal, you had more shots and scored a goal. Therefore like NEL said the shot to goal ratio was better. If we scored 1 goal and had five shot, we&amp;#039;d have 20% shots per goal ratio. If you had 10 and scored one, you&amp;#039;d have 10% shots to goal ratio.
