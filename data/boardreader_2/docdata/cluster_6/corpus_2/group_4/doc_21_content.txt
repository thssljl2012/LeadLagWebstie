   quote   SuperCesc07     and g_lfc , imagine how im felling, seeing my team *bleep* up a easy win against our major rivals, then getting beat by stoke.      Dude, how do you think they feel?  How do you think we felt when our 4 1/2 year record was lost?  We got over it, you really should too, it&amp;#039;s in the past, there&amp;#039;s a lot to look forward to if you guys pull together.
