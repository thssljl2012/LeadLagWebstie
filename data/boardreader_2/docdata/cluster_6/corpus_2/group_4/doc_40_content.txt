    quote  D I O S    Was the goal given? Yes Was he in the perfect position to tap-in said goal offside or not? Yes  The goal was only given due to poor officiating, 99 times out of 100 it would be given as offside Im sure. It has got to be one of the most ridiculous offside decisions Ive ever seen.  By the way, Im not dissagreeing with you about Anelka, I enjoyed his spell at Liverpool, Im just saying he wernt in the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; position ..  NEL: Im not saying he has been a success so far, but your saying he has been a dissapointment or whatever, and I dont think he has. Its a fact he hasnt played as well as we all know he can play. But there are positives to be taken from it. When he clicks he&amp;#039;ll be a great signing.
