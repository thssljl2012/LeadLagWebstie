 But we didnt buy him on a 15 game contract did we? 4 years was it? So I&amp;#039;ll be judging when he leaves the club whether he was a success or not. Crouch never scored for 26 games or something? He was a success here, in the end. Goals is obviously a big part of his game, but thats not all he&amp;#039;s worth. His work rate, an creativity is great. Which has been proven already at Liverpool. And yes Rafa would of expected more goals, but I read in an article last week about what he looks for in a striker &amp;amp; it isnt just goals. They have to work hard, play for the team &amp;amp; be a top professional etc. I&amp;#039;ll see if I can find the article in my history &amp;amp; get a quote.  D I O S - just gotta point out that Anelka was offside for one of his goals, so technically he wernt in the perfect position to score!
