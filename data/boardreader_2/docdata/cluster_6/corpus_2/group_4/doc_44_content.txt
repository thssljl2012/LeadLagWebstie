 I really don&amp;#039;t think we need any more investment in the squad until next summer. Anelka&amp;#039;s goals haven&amp;#039;t been spectacular but he&amp;#039;s joint top scorer with Zaki. He&amp;#039;s been working hard for the team (something everyone always said Anelka would never do), against Liverpool he was our 2nd best player behind Mikel, won most headers that went up to him and had zero support from Malouda and Kalou. Imo he doesn&amp;#039;t deserve to be dropped.
