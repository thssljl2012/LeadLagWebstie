 i hate to say it , but fair play to yids. They went 1-0 down to a team who has beaten Man U and Chelsea and gone unbeaten, and turned it around to beat them. Well, i guess spurs have done us a slight favour, Liv could have 8 points ahead still 5 now. If we can beat Man United (PLEASE WENGER AND THE TEAM)then we might have hope still. And to Arsenal09, i think the whole team needs a kick up the arse , because its behond a joke now. 2 promoted teams beaten us, a late , late draw v Sunderland, and a loss vs Fulham. If Cesc dont play well (today) then people like Walcott (Get Well Soon   )and RVP can&amp;#039;t play well either. Its a must win vs Man United . Gallas and Kolo are both fit for Man U , AW will rest Ade in midweek, and i hope hes fit.   Team (i hope) vs Manchester United:  Almunia  Clichy   Kolo Gallas  Sagna(if fit)or Eboue                                              Song  Diaby         Fab             Nasri              Ade (i hope) Niklas   My Pred : Arsenal 1: 1 Man United
