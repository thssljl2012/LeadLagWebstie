   quote   D I O S       quote   RizzyJay      Seriously, Anelka hasn&amp;#039;t done anything special. The hull goal was a mistake from a keeper. Sunderland - one is offside and nicked a goal from Alex. Another was a simple tap-in from an unselfish Malouda. And the third was luck.    He still hasn&amp;#039;t proven to me he should be 1st team       Malouda ahead of Anelka for me.   In each of those goals you&amp;#039;ll find Anelka in the perfect position to be and score or in the Hull case giving a good chase, that&amp;#039;s what he was for us. A (possibly surprisingly) hard worker who was in the right position to score every time. He will guarantee goals.    Hmmm, it sounds like Kuyt tbh...
