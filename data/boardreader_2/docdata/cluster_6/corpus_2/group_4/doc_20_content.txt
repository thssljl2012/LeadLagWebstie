   quote   Sam     Really don&amp;#039;t see any type of dig at JM in sweenEy&amp;#039;s post, he was just telling him the truth and it is true.   Well he kind of admitted that he had a dig at him by saying that he wasn&amp;#039;t going to give it a rest      quote   sweenEy       quote   The Realest     Yeah, Sweeno you do seem to pop up with an insult/dig at JM when he posts, just give it a rest ay?     How about no.    Don&amp;#039;t want to be like a lil snitch here and that it just annoy&amp;#039;s me when Sweeney always does this as he try&amp;#039;s to do it to me aswell    This message was edited by The Realest on Nov 01 2008.
