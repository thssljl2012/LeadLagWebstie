          15 points available? Yes  They are all very winnable and we&amp;amp;#039;re obviously favourites but the two away games will both be tough, Spurs especially. We&amp;amp;#039;ve struggled at home against sides like Stoke, and Pompey, but West Brom, Fulham and West Ham all try and play a fair bit of attacking football so that should play into our hands. I&amp;amp;#039;d probably take 13 from 15. There&amp;amp;#039;s no reason we cant win all 5 but it&amp;amp;#039;d be a mistake to think anything less than 15 was a bad thing.
