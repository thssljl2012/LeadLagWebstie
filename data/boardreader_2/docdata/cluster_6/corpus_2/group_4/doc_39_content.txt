   quote   D I O S     *bleep*ing stop it! One of the best players I have ever seen wear a Bolton top and you putting him down! If you don&amp;#039;t like him for the last time GIVE HIM *bleep*ING BACK! In each of those goals you&amp;#039;ll find Anelka in the perfect position to be and score or in the Hull case giving a good chase, that&amp;#039;s what he was for us.  A (possibly surprisingly) hard worker who was in the right position to score every time.  He will guarantee goals.  Can&amp;#039;t ask for much more from a striker imo, especially considering how we&amp;#039;re playing at the minute. Possibly missed Drogba v Liverpool but when I think about it Anelka won a lot of headers and had no support, so dunno how much more Drogba would&amp;#039;ve done.
