      Oh and hats off to Man Utd.. they came to Emirates to play football and played one hell of a game..  But we showed again.. if you play beautiful football.. we can play even more beautiful football..  having said that.. i felt we missed physical strength.. especially when their holding midfielders got the ball.. we couldn&amp;#039;t take it back from them..  Also.. I won&amp;#039;t mind Owen coming to us.. having seen the 2 headers Bendtner missed.. we need someone who can score from headers&amp;amp;#33;
