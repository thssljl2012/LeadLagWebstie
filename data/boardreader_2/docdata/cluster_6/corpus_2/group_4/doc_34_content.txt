The win against Liverpool improves there confidence by a shit load.     Stoke are borderline IMO. It will come down as to whether the other teams can figure out exactly how to stop Delap&amp;#039;s long throws. Other then that and Fuller, they dont offer much.     Fulham look a bit shaky. They have a good CM in Murphy and Bullard, but it tends to fall away from there. Bullard will need to play out of his skin and stay fit for them to survive again.     Bolton no-one cares.     Newcastle will be fine once they get rid of Ameobi. Either by playing two small guys up front in Owen and Martins or the return of Viduka. Barton is the x factor.     Plenty of others as well such as WBA and Wigan who are candidates     There are still a lot of relegation candidates, given how close the league currently is. Even the mid table sides would have some cause for concern...
