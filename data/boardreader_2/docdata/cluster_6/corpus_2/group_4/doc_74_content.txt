Well don&amp;#039;t be then.     It makes you look like a complete wanker.           Quote:                         I &amp;amp;lt;3 Theo Walcott.                     He&amp;#039;s been quite poor. Well below what he&amp;#039;s capable of. He&amp;#039;ll need to lift or he&amp;#039;ll find himself with tracksuit in hand.

Lucky to escape one in this game though.                      He should have more. The amount of shit he gets away with is quite amazing.     Foul mouthed gobshite with a horrible temper.
