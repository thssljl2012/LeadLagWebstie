I feel so much sympathy for you!        quote  The Realest    Don&amp;#039;t want to be like a lil snitch here and that it just annoy&amp;#039;s me when Sweeney always does this as  he try&amp;#039;s to do it to me aswell   Everyone tries to do it to you though! You&amp;#039;re far too easy.    This message was edited by D I O S on Nov 01 2008.
