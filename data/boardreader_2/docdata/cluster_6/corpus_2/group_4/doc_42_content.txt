  Seriously, Anelka hasn&amp;#039;t done anything special. The hull goal was a mistake from a keeper. Sunderland - one is offside and nicked a goal from Alex. Another was a simple tap-in from an unselfish Malouda. And the third was luck.    He still hasn&amp;#039;t proven to me he should be 1st team       Malouda ahead of Anelka for me.    On the otherhand Drogba went missing for the sunderland game. So, I do think we need to invest in a proven striker. However it has been rumuored that Roman can&amp;#039;t afford to spend due to the credit crunch which is fair enough i suppose.
