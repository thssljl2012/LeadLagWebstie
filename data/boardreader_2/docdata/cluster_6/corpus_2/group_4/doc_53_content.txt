   quote  So how does that make your finishing any better than ours? Or indeed, ours not better than yours?  Where exactly did I say Liverpool&amp;#039;s finishing was better than Tottenham&amp;#039;s? You finished one of your chances, as did Liverpool. So, how exactly is anyones finishing better than the other?    quote  Surely the term &amp;quot;finishing&amp;quot; refers to the shot on goal, and is still classed as a finish even if it doesn&amp;#039;t go in?  For example, missing a good chance is poor finishing while scoring from a tight angle is good finishing. As far as I knew it&amp;#039;s still classed as a finish or attempt at one whether the ball end up in the net or not.  Liverpool missed far more chances, so their finishing was poorer than that of Spurs.  I would think by using basic logic that the term finishing would equal a goal, as you&amp;#039;re finishing a chance. Tottenham may have had better chances, or Liverpool may have had better chances, but both only finished one of those chances, so I wouldn&amp;#039;t say either had better finishing. You can see it whatever way you want to, but I&amp;#039;ll go on if you miss a chance then it doesn&amp;#039;t count as a finishing.
