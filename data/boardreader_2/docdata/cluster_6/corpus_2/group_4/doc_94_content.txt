We need a big, ****-off, preferably Eastern European, who won&amp;#039;t lose a header all day, and who will keep going despite being covered in blood, and nursing several broken bones.      Almunia   Sagna - Vidic - Toure/Gallas - Clichy   Walcott - Flamini - Cesc - Nasri   Ade -   Ryan        would win the league.                      Heh. Will never get old.
