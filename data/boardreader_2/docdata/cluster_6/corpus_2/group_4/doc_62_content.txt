   quote  Will    Where exactly did I say Liverpool&amp;#039;s finishing was better than Tottenham&amp;#039;s? You finished one of your chances, as did Liverpool. So, how exactly is anyones finishing better than the other?  Because Liverpool had more chances than Tottenham, but they only converted one chance each, making Tottenham&amp;#039;s conversion rate better. I would&amp;#039;ve thought that was pretty easy to understand.
