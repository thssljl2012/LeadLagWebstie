          I&amp;amp;#039;d predict:    Saturday, 27 September 2008   Everton v Liverpool, 12:45&amp;amp;nbsp; 1-2   Sunday, 05 October 2008   Man City v Liverpool, 15:00&amp;amp;nbsp; 1-1   Saturday, 18 October 2008   Liverpool v Wigan, 15:00&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; 2-0   Sunday, 26 October 2008   Chelsea v Liverpool, 13:30&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; 1-1   Wednesday, 29 October 2008   Liverpool v Portsmouth, 20:00&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;2-0 &amp;amp;nbsp; That&amp;amp;#039;s being optimistic that we&amp;amp;#039;ll win the derby and get at least a point at City and Chelsea but eleven from fifteen is being realistic imo.
