 Sunderland 0 - 2  Middlesbrough     Blackburn 2 - 2 Fulham     Liverpool  3 - 1 Stoke City    West Ham 1 - 1 Newcastle United    Bolton 0 - 3  Arsenal     West Brom 1 - 2  Aston Villa    [EMBERS] Chelsea 0 - 0 Man Utd [/EMBERS]   Hull City 0 - 1  Everton     Man City 1 - 1 Portsmouth     Tottenham  3 - 2 Wigan      BTW, if Man Utd lose, it&amp;#039;d be getting a bit worrying for them. Nine pts down already (game in hand though).      If it were any other team (Chelsea side), they&amp;#039;d already be ruled out of the title race.
