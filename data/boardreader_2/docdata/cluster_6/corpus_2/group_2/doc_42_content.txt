Third of all, where is Bate Borisov from?  Is that even a real team? (I just searched wikipedia for Bate Borisov and according to that they are the Belarussian Premier League Champions.  Maybe ESPN got confused between the Barclays premier league champions and Belarussian.)    At least the Barca match should be a decent one because Sporting have some solid players.                      that is quite puzzling...
