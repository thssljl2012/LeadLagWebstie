 Bits If Im Padraig Harrington Im asking myself why I, seemingly the most likeable golfer on the entire planet, cant get the same grace and gratitude from Sergio Garcia that the Spaniard showed Vijay Singh Sunday  Love Mike Weirs playoff beard. Too bad he couldnt shave a few strokes of his score yesterday though. The Barclays really felt like it would be one of those come-from-behind Weir specials  The Ryder Cup will be a heck of a lot better if Sundays Euro Tour winner Darren Clarke is in the mix. Actually I cant think if anything that wouldnt be better off without the affable Irishman involved.
