 PARAMUS (New Jersey): Holder Steve Stricker made a spectacular eagle three on his way to a seven-under 64 to seize a three-shot lead after The Barclays second round on Friday.Stricker, whose 2007 win came across the Hudson River at Westchester Country Club, also registered five birdies for a 10-under 132 total at Ridgewood Country Club. "The course is in such good shape, that's why the scoring is good," said Stricker. "The greens are a little bit softer. They got a little firm and crusty on us yesterday afternoon ... a little more difficult to putt on." Stricker's eagle came at the third when his third shot from 70 yards flew past the hole before spinning back into the cup.Fellow American Hunter Mahan followed his opening 62 with a 73 to take second place on seven-under 135 in the first event of the PGA Tour's FedExCup playoffs. "That's golf," said Mahan. "Some days are easy and some days are hard. This is a hard day." Tied for third on 136 were Kenny Perry (67), the FedExCup points leader in the absence of the injured Tiger Woods, fellow American Dudley Hart (69) and 2007 US Open champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina (67).Another stroke back were Spain's Sergio Garcia, Briton Paul Casey and Americans Anthony Kim and Kevin Streelman. Ireland's Padraig Harrington, coming off back-to-back major wins in the British Open and US PGA Championship, felt the sting of missing the cut by two strokes after carding a 73 for 145. - Reuters
