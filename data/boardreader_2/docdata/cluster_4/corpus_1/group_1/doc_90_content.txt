 A man, carrying what is believed to be a gun, entered the bank and demanded cash at about 2.30pm this afternoon. He left with money, walking towards the library. Staff and customers, who were in the bank at the time, were shocked but otherwise unhurt. Jenny Tooley, who runs the Shepherd and Dog public house in Fulking with her husband Geoff, was in the bank moments before the robbery happened. She said: 'I had parked in the car park and had walked in to do some banking. I left and walked up the road and when I came back about 15 minutes later the bank was cordoned off. There were armed police outside and they said there was a hold-up. 'I must have just missed it. I could see the police helicopter. They wouldn't let me into the car park to get my car so someone came out to pick me up. 'You hear of break-ins in a shop or pub but you don't expect an armed robbery in Henfield. I was a bit speechless and amazed.' Police are searching the area around the bank and are appealing for witnesses to contact them on 0845 60 70 999. Police are investigating an armed robbery at Barclays Bank in Henfield.
