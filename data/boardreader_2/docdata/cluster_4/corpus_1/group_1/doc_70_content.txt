 Share:Kenny Egan, a light heavyweight boxer from Ireland who advanced to the medal round yesterday at the Olympics, was trying to figure out how to peak for the biggest events. He went to the right guy for help. Padraig Harrington has won only three times in the past 13 months, all of them major championships. 'He came to my house and basically was talking about how to peak, how to go to a big-time event and produce your best performance,' Harrington said yesterday at The Barclays in New Jersey. 'He was obviously a very talented competitor himself and knew what to do but was feeling that he was slightly underachieving at the big events.' Harrington said he mostly told Egan to concentrate on his own performance. He also gave him a few sports psychology books to read, similar to what he did when he was beginning his golf career. The three-time major champion said he also spoke to the Dublin soccer team a few years ago.  Ryder Cup race The race for the Ryder Cup team is complex in Europe, which has two weeks remaining for five players to earn a spot from the world points list then five more from a money list. Playing well should take care of everything, but there are a lot of moving parts. Ian Poulter has elected to play in The Barclays on the PGA Tour, where he likely would need to finish third to move into the top five on the points list. If he succeeds, that might knock Justin Rose down one spot to No. 4 on the money list, with four players close behind Rose. Carl Pettersson remains a long shot even after winning the Wyndham Championship. Paul Casey, in 18th place, earned a meagre 1.47 points by tying for 26th at the Wyndham.
