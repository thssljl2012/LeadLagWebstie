 Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari admits he is still waiting for the phone call to tell him Robinho is coming to Stamford Bridge.Real Madrid are adamant the Brazil forward will be staying in Spain even though the player is understood to be keen to move to the Barclays Premier League.And Scolari said: 'I don't know about Robinho because it is not my job to enter into talks about players. I said something to Peter (Kenyon) a month ago and they tried to bring Robinho here but my job is on the pitch.'He added: 'If they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings and I have to think about Tottenham not about whether players have come or have not come.'I don't know anything because I have not spoken to Peter for the last two days.'Scolari has so far signed only one player - Deco - since succeeding Avram Grant in the summer but had always been keen on acquiring Robinho as well.He said of his countryman: 'He is a very good player but it is not only me that wants him, all the coaches in the world do too.'But at the moment what is happening on the pitch is the only important thing for me. For my players to play well against Tottenham is what matters.'Leisure articlesWhat is it about chefs that makes them want to destroy fresh crisp cabbage with some sort of redcurrant jelly?After an Anglezarke ramble my daughter and I were famished and ready for a hearty meal so we ventured to The Robin Hood, in rural Mawdesley.I had been trying to book a table at the White Bull for weeks - every time I was told 'Sorry we're fully booked'.That close knit village feel is so tangible at The Original Farmers Arms.I hadn't had fish and chips for ages so when I saw it on the menu at the Euxton Mills pub I jumped at it straight away for a midweek lunch, knowing I'd be working late.
