 Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari has admitted Didier Drogba is unlikely to feature for his side until the very end of August.The 30-year-old has spent the summer recuperating from a knee injury which now looks certain to rule him out of the Blues' opening Barclays Premier League games against Portsmouth, on August 17, and Wigan a week later.Scolari has pencilled in the London derby against big-spending Tottenham on August 31 for a possible return but admits he will not rush the Ivory Coast star back into action. 'Didier will not play in our first game against Portsmouth and will probably miss the second against Wigan. If there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that,' said Scolari.'But when you have a knee injury, you just never know.'I have been getting a progress report from the doctor every day.'He's getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground. I hope he will be ready to start training next week. But he will not play until he is in good condition.'EDITORS CHOICEYou could join the audience for the Chapterhouse Theatre who present Sleeping Beauty on Wednesday August 20 2008 at 2pm.Elizabeth Arden introduces their striking new colour collection for summer 2008  bronze tones and shimmery colors that bring beach-warmed beauty to eyes, cheeks and lips.Plans for a 10million flagship care housing scheme in Oldbury have been given the green light.Move over Batman and Spiderman  a summer holiday club for junior super heroes is being held at Hurst Green Methodist Church next week.The Dark Knight  the follow-up to Batman Begins which was released back in 2005  reunites director Christopher Nolan with the caped crusader in his continuing war on crime.A D.I.Y disabled parking bay painted by a great-grandad outside his Colley Gate home has been removed by Dudley Council.
