 BreakingNews.ie&gt; Sport &gt; OlympicsThree-time major winner Padraig Harrington has praised the performance of Irelands Olympic boxing medallist Kenny Egan.Harrington, in New Jersey preparing for his first tournament since winning the US PGA Championship earlier this month, was reacting to news Egan had booked his place in the boxing semi-finals in Beijing, guaranteeing Ireland at least a bronze medal.Egan, who reached the last four with an 8-0 whitewash of Brazils Washington Silva at the Beijing Workers Gymnasium, had publicly thanked Harrington for his help and the golfer admitted he had spent a day with the boxer helping him mentally prepare for the Olympics.And the golfer, preparing for The Barclays tournament at Ridgewood Country Club, said: A couple of times in the past, athletes have come and asked for advice, Kenny being one of them.He came to my house, and basically was talking about how to peak, how to go to a big-time event and produce your best performance.He was obviously a very talented competitor himself and knew what to do, but was feeling that he was slightly under-achieving at the big events.He came and we had a chat. We had a good day to get together and I went through a few things, gave him a bit of advice, gave him a few books to read, and its good to see its paying off.Harrington, though, played down his contribution to the Olympic medal effort.I wont take credit for it, he continued.Any boxer, they put in incredible amounts of work. Its nice that hes saying these things, but one of the keys I put across to him at the time, and Im sure some of this is driven by the media here, but one of the keys is his ability to do his own thing and be self-sufficient and concentrate on his own personal performance and not get distracted.I think he obviously is doing that, and it is a tremendous success.Harrington had one more piece of advice for Egan, who will fight Britains light-heavyweight rival Tony Jeffries in Fridays semi-final.He added: I would suggest that he shouldnt be thinking at this stage, there should be only one thought in his head, and thats the semi-final bout and not get too drawn into how hes done so far. Theres plenty more ahead.Related Links:20/08/2008 20/08/2008 Sutherland in quarter-final action19/08/2008 Egan 'over the moon' with medal-winning victory19/08/2008 Egan secures another medal for Ireland19/08/2008 Heartbreak for Hession in Beijing19/08/2008 Racing postponed for Irish Star sailors19/08/2008 Ireland win first Beijing medal19/08/2008 D-Day for Irish boxers18/08/2008 Isinbeaeva breaks world pole vault record16/08/2008 Solid results for O'Leary and Milne16/08/2008 Wrestler stripped of medal after podium protest16/08/2008 Cuddihy fails to qualify for semis16/08/2008 Phelps wins historic seventh medal by a fingertip16/08/2008 Knockout success for Olympic boxer Sutherland16/08/2008 Heartbreak for Heffernan in 20K Walk16/08/2008 Irish sailors finish 15th15/08/2008 One time fault for Lynch in Beijing15/08/2008 Progress for Irish sailors15/08/2008 Nevin beaten in last 16 bout15/08/2008 Another gold for Phelps
