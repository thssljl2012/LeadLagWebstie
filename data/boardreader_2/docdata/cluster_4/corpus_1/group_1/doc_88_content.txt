 The race for Ryder Cup points enters its final lap in this week's Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles.With Europe's team being decided on Sunday, only seven places are assured of the 12 who will feature under non-playing captain Nick Faldo against the United States at Valhalla, Kentucky from September 19-21.Three of the automatic qualifiers are still in doubt and Faldo will also add two wildcard selections after the Scottish event.British pair Justin Rose (eighth) and Oliver Wilson (10th) and Soren Hansen of Denmark (ninth) are the three players desperately trying to remain in the Cup table's top 10. The only players who could overtake the trio at Gleneagles are German Martin Kaymer (11th) and Britons Ross Fisher (13th) and Nick Dougherty (14th). Britain's Ian Poulter (12th) decided not to return from the US PGA Tour to attempt to play his way into the team and is one of several players hoping for a wild card.Faldo dropped a broad hint while commentating on TV at the Barclays Classic in New Jersey at the weekend that he had Briton Paul Casey in mind for a pick.Darren Clarke's four-shot victory in the Dutch Open has also made him a favorite for a wildcard. Eight-time European No1 Colin Montgomerie is another contender but unless he wins at Gleneagles the 45-year-old Scot's selection would only be for his sparkling Ryder Cup record.
