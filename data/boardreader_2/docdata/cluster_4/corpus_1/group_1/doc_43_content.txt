 Padraig Harrington has given an insight into the almost mythical team spirit that drives Europes Ryder Cup Team as they prepare to defend the trophy at Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky. The double Major Champion, speaking from this weeks US PGA Tour event, The Barclays, says that despite the differing languages, nationalities and cultures within Nick Faldos Team Room, the European Team will once again be united in their cause to win The Ryder Cup Trophy for a record breaking fourth time. Everything changes for some reason the week of The Ryder Cup, said The Open and US PGA Championship winner. We all pull together in Europe. There are many guys that make up a Team, and often there are guys on that Team that you might not have had dealings with or that speak a different language or struggle with English, but for the whole week, there is a bond there. It's an amazing feeling that week and an amazing tournament because it creates that atmosphere. It's hard to explain how well the Team gels together. You've got to remember, all 12 of us compete against each other all the time during the year, and some of the guys are competing tooth and nail to get onto the Team with other guys. There's a lot of competition there. But when we arrive on the Monday of Ryder Cup week, it really is a big Team. It all works very well. I always say the interesting thing about The Ryder Cup is the Monday after tournament when you go to another event and meet a teammate. There will be hugs on the practice tee on the Monday after The Ryder Cup. The following week, you meet your teammate, it's high fives on the practice tee; and the following week, it's shaking hands on the practice tee; and the following week it's a wave; and the following week, it's the head down and keep going!But that's what The Ryder Cup does. It just generates that team bonding, I suppose, and it works incredibly well the week of the tournament.
