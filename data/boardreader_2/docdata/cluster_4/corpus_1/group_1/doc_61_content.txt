 Recurring tonsillitis may be the cause of the lingering health problem that wiped out Adam Scott's chances in the major championships this year.Scott had blood tests a fortnight ago and although he is waiting for a definitive diagnosis, doctors have told him that recurring tonsillitis is the most probable cause for his persistent throat pain and fatigue.'I'm going to have some more tests when I get back to Australia,' said the Queenslander, who will have his tonsils removed if necessary.'I feel okay at the moment but I get worn out easily. My swing hasn't been great since Loch Lomond (the week before the British Open in July).'This has been a bit of a crazy year, the last six months. Over the last few months, with illness and injury, I just haven't been able to put the work in and my game's suffering a bit.'I would like to have worked on it in Akron (at the Bridgestone Invitational) and didn't get the opportunity. I tried to work on it at the PGA and didn't get it done.'The lack of preparation has shown itself on the course, as a rusty Scott has missed the cut in his past two starts at the US PGA Championship as well as last week's Barclays tournament, where he shot a second round 82.Scott did not have a top-20 finish in any of the four majors this year.He's hoping for some improvement at the Deutsche Bank Championship starting on Thursday at the course where he recorded his maiden US Tour victory five years ago - the Boston TPC.He is part of a 120-man field that includes 12 Australians in the second of four events in the US Tour's so-called play-off series.The field will be cut to 70 players for next week's event, and then to 30 for the play-off finale, the Tour Championship.Not only may Scott miss the Tour Championship but, due to the volatility of the points standings, is not even assured of advancing to next week's event if he misses the cut in Boston.He dropped from 24th to 47th on the standings by missing the cut last week, while Mathew Goggin was the big Australian mover, jumping from 76th to 26th.'I was hitting the ball so well last week, it was a big advantage to get on a tough driving course,' said Goggin, who stormed home with a closing 67 to finish equal fourth at the Barclays, just one stroke out of a play-off.
