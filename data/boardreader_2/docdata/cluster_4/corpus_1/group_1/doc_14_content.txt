 Great performance by Mike Weir over the weekend at the Barclays" must be the beard. Glad to know that in his later years, Weir is able to grow a beard. When he was in his early 20s, he had a moustache that barely grew in. It was quite the cheesy look, along with his big glasses, which were apparently stylish back in the day. If memory serves me correctly, his friends gave him the nickname Chico, because the hair that was barely there gave him the look of Freddie Prinze in Chico and The Man.
