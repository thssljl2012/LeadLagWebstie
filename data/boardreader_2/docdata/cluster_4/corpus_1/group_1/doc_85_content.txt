 Canada's leader Mike Weir is the new favourite for the Deutsche Bank Championship after he matched the course record with a 10-under 61 in the opening round. That put him three strokes ahead of Fiji's Vijay Singh and Americans John Merrick, Briny Baird and Heath Slocum and means Weir is now a top-priced 4/1 with Stan James. The Bettingzone's 16/1 headline tip Singh comes next at a general 5/1 after he continued the sizzling form that took him to victory at last week's Barclays Championship, reeling off eight birdies in a seven-under 64. 'I have a great attitude on the greens,' said the 45-year-old from Fiji, who recently reverted to the mid-length belly putter after struggling for a while with a regular one. 'I just listen to my head, and my head's very positive. I think that's the best attitude you can have, just listen to your own mind.' It's then 16/1 bar which brings in another Zone tip in the shape of Anthony Kim who also started strongly with a 66.Latest Zone Stories
