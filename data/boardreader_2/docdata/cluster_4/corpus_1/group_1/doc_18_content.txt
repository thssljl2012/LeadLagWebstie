 PARAMUS, N.J.  Steve Stricker is right at home at Ridgewood Country Club  and the top of The Barclays leaderboard. A year after winning across the Hudson at Westchester Country Club, the Wisconsin player shot a 7-under 64 in perfect morning conditions Friday to take a three-stroke lead over former Oklahoma State standout and Plano resident Hunter Mahan in the FedEx Cup playoff opener. 'This reminds me of home to tell you the truth,' Stricker said. 'This looks like a course that could be very easily in the Midwest somewhere. It reminds me of Medinah a lot. The grasses are the same. We putt on poa annua greens a lot where I'm from. It's bentgrass fairways, bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home.' The 41-year-old Stricker, 21st in the FedEx Cup standings, had a 10-under 132 total on the tree-lined A.W. Tillinghast layout, the tournament site for the first time after 41 seasons at Westchester. He hasn't made a bogey since dropping strokes on the first two holes Thursday, playing his last 23 holes in 11 under. 'I think the course is in such good shape, that's why the scoring is good,' Stricker said. 'I think as we get further along, the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it, understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there.' Mahan, 31st in the FedEx Cup standings, followed his opening 62 with a 73. 'I probably hit it better than I did yesterday, but nothing went in,' Mahan said. Kenny Perry, effectively the FedEx Cup leader with top-ranked Tiger Woods sidelined by a knee injury, shot a 67 to join Angel Cabrera (67) and Dudley Hart (69) at 6 under. 'I'm ecstatic,' Perry said. 'I'm in a good position.' Dallas' Anthony Kim (67), Sergio Garcia (67), Kevin Streelman (70), Charley Hoffman (70) and Paul Casey (71) were 5 under. 'I definitely played a lot better,' Kim said. 'It's a lot more fun when you're not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways.'
