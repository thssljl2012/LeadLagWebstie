 RECURRING tonsillitis may be the cause of Adam Scott's lingering health problem that has affected his form.Scott had blood tests a fortnight ago and although he is waiting for a definitive diagnosis, doctors have said that recurring tonsillitis is the most probable cause for his persistent throat pain and fatigue. The Queenslander, who has slipped from world No. 4 in June to outside the top 10, said he would have his tonsils removed if necessary. 'I'm going to have some more tests when I get back to Australia,' Scott said. 'I feel OK at the moment, but I get worn out easily. My swing hasn't been great since Loch Lomond (the week before the British Open in July). 'This has been a bit of a crazy year, (especially) the last six months. Over the last few months, with illness and injury, I just haven't been able to put the work in and my game's suffering a bit.' The lack of preparation has shown itself on the course. Scott has missed the cut in his past two starts, the  and last week's Barclays tournament, where he shot a second-round 82. He is part of a 120-man field at the  at the Boston TPC, starting overnight, which includes 12 Australians in the second of four events in the US PGA Tour's playoff series. The field will be cut to 70 next week and then 30 for the finale, the Tour Championship. While Scott dropped from 24th to 47th on the playoff standings by missing the cut last week, Mathew Goggin shot up from 76th to 26th after finishing tied for fourth at the Barclays.
