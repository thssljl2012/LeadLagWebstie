The WGC-Bridgestone Invitational winner three weeks ago, Singh also earned US$1.26 million ($1.8m) for his 33rd tour victory.Third-round leader Kevin Streelman, Ben Curtis and Mathew Goggin tied for fourth at 7 under.'It was a tough day. It wasn't easy to get close to the hole, so birdie was difficult to come by,' Singh said. 'It was drying out really, really a lot, and you've got to play almost conservative on some holes.'But it was a great play-off, though. I enjoyed that.' AP
