 Sergio Garcia is the new favourite for The Barclays tournament after a dramatic third round at Ridgewood Country Club. A disastrous back nine for defending champion and overnight leader Steve Stricker blew the event wide open and forced a hasty revision of the betting market. Stricker saw four bogeys and a triple bogey at the 12th dismantle his three-shot lead in this opening event of the FedEx Cup play-offs as world number 269 Kevin Streelman found himself with the 54-hole lead, one shot in front of a quartet comprising Garcia, Vijay Singh, Paul Casey and Mike Weir. And the bookies expect the winner to come from that select group of four who are tied for second, with Garcia the market leader at a top-priced 10/3 with extrabet. Singh is a general 9/2 chance, Weir is 15/2 at bet365 and Casey is 8/1 with Paddy Power and William Hill. It's then 10/1 about Streelman and 20/1 bar. Stricker has been shunted out to 40/1.Latest Zone Stories
