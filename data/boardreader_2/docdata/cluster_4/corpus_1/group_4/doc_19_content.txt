Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear believes Mike Ashley will have to reconsider his strategy for the club if he cannot find a buyer in the next three weeks.  Owner Ashley has been seeking a buyer since falling from favour with the club's supporters following former boss Kevin Keegan's resignation. Kinnear expects Ashley to reveal the outcome of his sale mission after Newcastle's match against Chelsea on November 22.  He said: 'I think you'll get a statement after Chelsea. I think he will have to - it's been a long time without anything being said now. I was originally brought in for eight games and in that time-span he thought the club would be sold. If it's not, he's got to come up with other ideas.'  Kinnear recently signed a one-month extension to the short-term deal he signed in September, and the former Wimbledon manager is ready to inform Ashley on where the team can be strengthened, to ensure relegation is avoided.  Kinnear, whose team face Aston Villa in the Barclays Premier League on Monday, said of Ashley: 'I think he's prepared to sit down and say, 'Okay, where do we go from here?'.  'He might be more advised by me. I'd probably say we need four players and we maybe need to shift some out. I would advise him to go that route anyway.'
