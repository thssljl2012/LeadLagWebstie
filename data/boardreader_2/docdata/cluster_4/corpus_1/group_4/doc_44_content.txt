calls off O'Neill  Gabriel Agbonlahor has decided against making an official complaint against Joey Barton over the Newcastle midfielder's alleged racist taunts.  The England Under 21 striker was asked twice by manager Martin O'Neill whether he wanted to pursue the matter further but on the eve of Villa's UEFA Cup trip to Slavia Prague he chose not to follow it up formally.  It had been suggested Barton mouthed obscenities at Agbonlahor during Newcastle's 2-0 victory over Villa on Monday. O'Neill, no stranger to prejudice in his public life as Celtic manager, had been keen to take up the matter.

'I asked Gabby on Tuesday night and I've asked him again today,' said O'Neill.  'He doesn't want to take it further, so we are going to leave it at that. He doesn't want to do anything so what else can we do? If he had wished to take it further, then we would have been in full support. So, you know, good luck to Joey Barton.  'We haven't gone into any lip-reading exercises. However, we did see the tapes again. We asked Gabby again to make sure but we are not going any further. That's his view. And he's pretty important in all of this. We shall abide by his decision.'  The FA confirmed that they had asked for the observations of Villa's manager and Agbonlahor.  A spokesman said: 'We have a duty of care to investigate any allegations of racism.'  However, it appears unlikely that Soho Square could press charges against Barton if  Agbonlahor does not want to offer up any testimony. If they did, it would be the word of a third party - O'Neill - against the Newcastle player.  Villa have one week in which to come up with an answer for the FA and, although O'Neill confirmed that he would 're-visit' the issue and co-operate fully with the authorities, it is unlikely he will come to a different conclusion.  Barton was defended yesterday by his agent, Willie Mackay, who said: 'It's a nonsense. Who do you think scored Newcastle's two goals on Monday night? It was a black lad (Obafemi Martins) and Joey celebrated with him. Are those the actions of someone who would get caught up in something like this?  'I think Martin O'Neill is peeved because his two England midfielders were made to look very ordinary by Joey on Monday night.'  The Villa squad left for Prague yesterday without striker Marlon Harewood and midfielders James Milner and Stiliyan Petrov.  That means Steve Sidwell is likely to make his first start since July's InterToto Cup tie against Odense having returned from injury with three appearances off the bench in the Barclays Premier League.  Slavia have just moved into a new ground - the Eden Stadium - and so far it has been paradise for them.  In six matches they have scored 18 goals and conceded just one. They are top of the Czech league and O'Neill predicts a tough test.  'This game will be exceptionally difficult for us,' he said.  'Technically, Slavia are very, very good. We have a great deal of respect for them. We have dreams of progressing in this competition and it is really important to get something from this game. Slavia have played in the Champions League and are a really good footballing side.  'They have a load of international players and they fancy themselves to get through. They are well up for the game.'  New deal: Flying winger Ashley Young has signed a new four-year deal with the Midlands club  O'Neill explained why it was necessary to tie winger Ashley Young to the club with a new four-year deal worth 2.5million a year, making him one of the club's highest earners.  'For his contribution to the side he should be paid appropriately. It gives us a wee bit of delight and any pressing concerns about him potentially leaving shouldn't be there. It is perfect for him and right for us,' said O'Neill.  'When he is fit, he plays every week for us and the last thing he needs in his career now is playing once every three weeks. He's only a young lad, but he is worth considerably more than we paid for him (9.65m) last year.'
