Chelsea returned to the top of the Barclays Premier League courtesy of Nicolas Anelka's double in a 2-0 win at Blackburn.  Anelka struck once in each half to make it a perfect birthday present for manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, who turned 60 on Sunday.  The win leaves Chelsea level on 29 points with Liverpool but with a far superior goal difference.
