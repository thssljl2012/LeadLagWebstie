Thomas Sorensen made a series of fine second-half saves to secure another valuable Barclays Premier League point for Stoke in a goalless draw at the JJB Stadium.  Sorensen pulled off a late double-save to deny both Amr Zaki and Antonio Valencia and also got down well to gather an effort from Emile Heskey.  Tony Pulis' men offered little in the attacking department besides a 55th-minute header from Ryan Shawcross which sailed into the arms of home goalkeeper Chris Kirkland.
