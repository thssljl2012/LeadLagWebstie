Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas has challenged his team-mates to prove they are good enough to turn around their recent slump when they face Manchester United at the weekend.  The Gunners were held to a goalless draw against Fenerbahce in the Champions League last night, meaning they have gone three games without a victory.  Next is United in a clash that they need to win to get their Barclays Premier League title bid back on track.  'We have to keep going,' Fabregas said. 'The next match, against Manchester United, is massive. This is welcomed because it's a big game and big players want to play in big games.'  Gunners boss Arsene Wenger accused referees and opponents of victimising his side following the stalemate with Fenerbahce.  Mikael Silvestre is a fresh injury concern after his nose was injured in a challenge involving Semih Senturk.  Wenger said: 'Was it intentional? I don't know. He rotated his arm. You must ask the player.'
