Stoke manager Tony Pulis is hoping striker Mamady Sidibe will be fit for the Barclays Premier League match against Manchester United at Old Trafford tomorrow.  Sidibe suffered an ankle injury in the draw with Wigan and missed the Carling Cup victory over League Two side Rotherham.  Pulis is set to revert to the side that secured a point last Saturday after making wholesale changes in midweek.  Provisional squad: Sorensen, Griffin, Shawcross, Abdoulaye Faye, Higginbotham, Olofinjana, Amdy Faye, Diao, Delap, Sidibe, Fuller, Whelan, Cresswell, Kitson, Simonsen, Wilkinson, Cort, Tong, Pugh, Dickinson.
