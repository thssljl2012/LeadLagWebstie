West Brom centre-back Abdoulaye Meite will return to the squad for the visit of Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea if he suffers no reaction to his calf after returning to training yesterday.  Meite sustained the initial injury against his former club Bolton in late August and then broke down in the warm-up before the home clash with Aston Villa three weeks later.  Midfielder James Morrison is also in contention after overcoming a back problem. Defender Neil Clement (knee) is the only long-term casualty as bottom-placed Albion look to pull off a shock and improve on a record of one point from the last five games.  Team (from): Carson, Kiely, Zuiverloon, Donk, Olsson, Robinson, Morrison, Greening, Koren, Valero, Brunt, Miller, Bednar, Hoefkens, Cech, Do-Heon, Moore, MacDonald, Pele, Teixeira, Meite, Morrison.
