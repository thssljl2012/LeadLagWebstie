 FT: Liverpool 3 West Brom 0 Liverpool returned to the top of the Barclays Premier League thanks to Robbie Keanes first two league goals for the club. Keane had only previously scored twice in the Champions League prior to his 12th league appearance for the club since his 20m move in the summer. But Keane scored in the 34th and 43rd minutes to secure the points and extend Liverpools unbeaten home record this year. Torres arrival finally came after 71 minutes, in place of the disappointed Keane who had been striving for a hat-trick. Albion replaced Koren with Chris Brunt. Torres was soon into the action, taking a Benayoun pass before dispatching a fierce, low shot saved by Carson. Liverpool sent on Alonso to replace Gerrard with 10 minutes left. Javier Mascherano was booked for a foul on Paul Robinson with two minutes left. Liverpool had to wait until the final minute for their third, when full-back Arbeloa cut in from the right to fire into the top corner.
