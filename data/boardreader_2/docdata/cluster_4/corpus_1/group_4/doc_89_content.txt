Rampant Chelsea stormed back to the top of the Barclays Premier League after with a 3-0 defeat of bottom club West Brom at The Hawthorns.  First-half goals from Jose Boswinga and a Nicola Anelka double were enough to secure victory against the Baggies.  After an evenly balanced opening half hour, Boswinga broke the deadlock after 34 minutes with a 30-yard drive.  Then four minutes l  ater Anelka struck for the sixth time in the last three league games and then added another in first-half injury-time.  Boswinga gave the Blues the lead after 34 minutes. There appeared to be little danger but Boswinga suddenly unleashed a powerful left-footed drive from 30 yards out which Scott Carson got a hand to but could not prevent from entering the net.  Albion were stunned by this setback and after 38 minutes Anelka doubled Chelsea's lead with his sixth goal in the past three league games.  Florent Malouda's headed pass was seized on by the Anelka and he had the confidence to race into the area and dink the ball past an exposed Carson.  Then in first half injury-time Anelka struck again from a narrow angle with Kalou the creator this time.  Didier Drogba, on the bench after his coin-throwing incident against Burnely, came on as a substitute for Anelka in the second half but there were no further goals.
