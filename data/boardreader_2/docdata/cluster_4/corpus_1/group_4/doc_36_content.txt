Chelsea's England left-back Ashley Cole has been diagnosed with a small tear to his calf muscle and will be out for seven to ten days.  Cole was injured in a challenge with Steed Malbranque during Saturday's 5-0 win over Sunderland and will now miss Tuesday's Champions League game against Roma and next weekend's Barclays Premier League fixture against Blackburn Rovers.  Defender Ricardo Carvalho (hamstring) and Michael Ballack (foot) and Michael Essien (knee) remain out.  Roma sit just one point clear of the relegation zone in Serie A and lie third in Champions League Group A after three games, three points behind leaders Chelsea and a point off surprise package CFR Cluj.  Roma coach Luciano Spalletti has yet to decide whether to risk captain Francesco Totti against Chelsea.  Totti limped out of training on Friday with a recurring knee injury and did not play in the defeat at the hands of Juventus at the weekend.  Roma will be without injured duo Alberto Aquilani and Vincenzo Montella.  Chelsea squad: Cech, Cudicini, Hilario, Ferreira, Bridge, Obi, Ivanovic, Alex, Terry, Lampard, Sinclair, Drogba, Belletti, Anelka, Malouda, Stoch, Kalou, Deco, Bosingwa, J Cole.
