Newcastle boss Joe Kinnear will draw on his experiences at Wimbledon as he attempts to fight his way through a tide of negative publicity.  The 61-year-old announced his arrival on Tyneside with a now infamous broadside aimed in the direction of sections of the national press, and was in fighting mood once again as he prepared for tomorrow's Barclays Premier League trip to Fulham.  Monday's 2-0 victory over Aston Villa, the club's second successive league win, was overshadowed by the controversy surrounding midfielder Joey Barton - who found himself the subject of allegations of racist abuse after his spat with Gabriel Agbonlahor.  Kinnear has since ordered the 26-year-old to let his football do the talking and warned him his reputation will inevitably precede him as he attempts to rebuild his career after a spell in prison and a lengthy ban.  However, the Magpies' interim boss is determined not to allow the critics to derail his rebuilding mission.  Kinnear said: 'I understand what he [Barton] is going through, because there wasn't a day went by when I didn't have the same sort of stuff when I was at Wimbledon - so it is not new to me.'
