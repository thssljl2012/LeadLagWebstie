JOE Kinnear is keen to hang on to his job at Newcastle - whoever owns the club.  The 61-year-old tasted victory for the first time in his four-match reign to date when the Magpies edged past promoted West Brom 2-1 in a game that remained up for grabs until the final whistle.  Victory lifted Kinnear's men out of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone and atoned to a small extent for Saturday's derby defeat at Sunderland.  But if things on the pitch are starting to turn, the uncertainty off it remains with owner Mike Ashley still looking to sell, and the interim manager does not know how long his stay will last.  He said: 'I go from day to day, to be honest. If it gets sold, it will be up to the new owner.  'I am only on a month-to-month contract, that was the deal before I took over.  'I am well aware I took over because lots of people turned that contract down, but as we go on, I live like everyone else, day to day.  'I have got no idea who is going to buy the place, but I can throw my hat in the ring whoever buys it. I am not going to get another chance like this.  'But I really don't know, to be honest. I know it is obviously for sale, but who is going to buy it, I have got no idea.'  Whatever happens in the weeks and months ahead, Kinnear will at least be able to reflect on a crucial win over the Baggies just when his side needed it most.  His decision to hand controversial midfielder Joey Barton his first start for the club since he was released from jail paid off handsomely when the 26-year-old converted a ninth-minute penalty to give his side a rare lead.  The win brings some welcome relief to a club that has had little to celebrate since they last won in the league on August 23.  The Magpies boss said: 'We didn't want to dwell on the Sunderland disappointment, so I am really pleased that we got this game under our belts and we got a victory doing it.'
