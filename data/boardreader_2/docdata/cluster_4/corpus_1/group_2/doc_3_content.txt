Newcastle have chosen Joe Kinnear as their interim manager, until the end of October.The former Wimbledon, Luton and Nottingham Forest boss has the job with the troubled Barclays Premier League team on a short-term basis.The Magpies turned to the 61-year-old after former England boss Terry Venables turned down the job on Thursday, following Kevin Keegan's departure earlier this month.Kinnear said: 'I am very excited about the challenge in front of me at Newcastle United.'Results have not been great of late, but there is a lot of quality in the squad and I am very confident the players are capable of climbing the league table.'Newcastle United is a great club. When I was in charge of Wimbledon, I always remember the passion of the fans up there and how great a stadium St James' Park is.'It is a big challenge, but one I am really looking forward to.'Kinnear told Radio Five Live that he will be in charge for six games, and then his understanding was that new owners would bring back Keegan along with Alan Shearer.He explained: 'I think the club's going to be sold at the beginning of October and Chris Hughton needs all the help he can get.'So if I can get in there and get a few results together until obviously the two main people are named, I assume from the new people coming in they will be Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer. I have the utmost respect for those sort of players.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
