 MANCHESTER City manager mark Hughes is relishing the chance to compete with the Barclays Premier League's big guns as the prospective takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment moves closer to completion.Former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra has agreed to sell City to the United Arab Emirates-based group and the deal should be sealed soon. The potential new owner, Dr Sulaiman al-Fahim, has already stated his wish to make City a top-four club and signalled his intent by bidding for Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov. Even if City don't land Berbatov, Hughes is convinced the club now has the potential to become one of England's superpowers. 'Everyone is stunned and excited, the fans and me both,' Hughes said. 'I had heard for a couple of weeks that there was interest from the Middle East. It's great news. 'There's a real buzz around the club. You can sense the excitement and expectation that this time it won't be a false dawn and we can establish ourselves as a top six or top four club. 'By all accounts the owners have the means to spend big money. Obviously we want the correct players to allow us to grow. 'When I joined I wanted the resources to compete at the top table and that's what I've got.' 'Expectations will rise now but that's fine. There's been a lot of negative publicity around the club and hopefully that's been wiped away.' The Eastlands faithful have also given their seal of approval to the takeover and Kevin Parker, general secretary of City's official supporters club, said: 'Football clubs are looking for investors with deep pockets and it would appear they have got deep pockets. 'For me it's not about the money. We need somebody giving us stability. 'In the past 30 years we haven't had any success and we're desperate to win a trophy. 'It hasn't been pleasant reading about Thaksin facing charges of corruption and being on the run. I'm excited at the prospect of what the takeover might bring.' Agence France-Presse
