Frank Lampard has claimed referees will reduce games to five-a-side matches after Mark Halsey stood by his decision to send off John Terry during Chelsea's 3-1 win at Manchester City. Terry will formally appeal against the red card after being offered some encouragement that the FA may yet overrule the referee. Halsey will submit his report to the FA on Monday but Sportsmail understands he is standing by his decision after reviewing the controversial incident.

Lampard said: 'He's obviously been sent off for a professional foul, it can't have just been for the block. 'If you start giving out red cards for that, we will be reduced to five-a-sides.' Lampard also spoke out in support of assistant manager Steve Clarke after Chelsea refused to let him move to West Ham. He said: 'If Clarke goes, it will be a loss but I don't think you can take away a man's right to do what he wants.' No comments have so far been submitted.
