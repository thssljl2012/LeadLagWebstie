Chelsea look set to be without Michael Essien for the rest of the year after it was confirmed the midfielder would need surgery on a knee injury.The 25-year-old suffered the problem while on international duty with Ghana.A club statement read: 'Michael has ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament and will undergo an operation as soon as the majority of the swelling has subsided. We expect this to happen in a week's time. A return to full fitness is not expected for several months.'The statement continued: 'In the meantime, Michael has started rehab in the aqua therapy centre at Cobham which will improve the condition of the knee prior to surgery.'The loss of the combative Ghanaian for such a long period is a major blow to the Blues, who have no like-for-like replacement available and will not be able to buy any fresh faces before the transfer window re-opens in January.Essien had landed awkwardly during the World Cup qualifier against Libya, and was immediately taken to hospital for scans, with the diagnosis now confirmed by Chelsea's own medical staff.Luiz Felipe Scolari's men are next in Barclays Premier League action away to Manchester City on Saturday before then embarking on their European campaign at home to Bordeaux and a clash with champions Manchester United on September 21.Latest blogs and columnsLancashire Telegraph comment: Britain is knwon throughout the world as a nation of animal lovers.Shuiab Khan column: Apparently being happy has a got a lot to do with where you live.Lancashire Telegraph comment: The exploits of our athletes in Beijing, where they secured 47 medals including 19 golds, was a tremendous boost for the nation.Jack Straw column: So much for all those doom merchants who like to write off East Lancashire in general, and Blackburn in particular.Nick Nunn column: There's nothing really new about the idea of the criminal who deep down has a heart of gold.Lancashire Telegraph comment: It is worrying that East Lancashire Hospitals Trusts emergency plan to deal with increased demand for beds has already attracted criticism.
