A club statement said.'All matters relating to the sale of the club, including inquiries from interested parties, should go through Seymour Pierce. The club will be making no further comment at this time.'Ashley confirmed he was putting the club up for sale after fans staged mass protests against him and the recruitment team he appointed before and after the 2-1 Barclays Premier League defeat by promoted Hull.He, managing director Derek Llambias, executive director (football) Dennis Wise and vice-president (player recruitment) Tony Jimenez last week flew to Dubai in an effort to push through a quick disposal.However, amid a flurry of statements from supposedly interested parties insisting they were not in the market for the club, and allegations of snubbed meetings, they returned without a deal having been struck.As well as being linked with potential purchasers in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, there has been talk of investment from China, Qatar and more recently, Nigeria.Indeed, reports from Africa have suggested a bid of 350million - some 130million less than the asking price allegedly quoted last week - has already been tabled.Ashley bought Newcastle around 16 months ago for 134.4million, and has since invested a further 110million to service the debts he inherited and fund transfers.EDITORS CHOICEHUNDREDS of people turned out to enjoyed Droitwich Spas annual Salt Day festival at the weekend.AN historic piece of Droitwich Spas waterway heritage is set to open its gates for the first time in decades following major restoration work.THE towns new multi-million pound state-of-the-art medical centre has opened its doors.DRAMATIC displays from one of the largest falconry exhibition teams in the UK will delight customers at Webbs in Wychbold on Sunday, September 21.SPA residents will be given a chance to see final plans to bring a major leisure and retail development to the town this week.A GROUP of kind-hearted golfers got into the swing of a charity event, which was held at the Droitwich Golf and Country Club.
