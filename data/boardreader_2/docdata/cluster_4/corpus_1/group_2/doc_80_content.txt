Mark Hughes' City side make the trip to the JJB hoping to upset Latic's unbeaten Premiership record against them. Steve Bruce is confident that his side can more than cope with the new pretenders.BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE - JJB StadiumSunday September 28th 2008 4.00 pm Steve Bruce should be back to a near full strength squad for the visit of Manchester City, Erik Edman is now the only player injured after Ryan Taylor recovered from his niggling injury. Scharner also came back into the team that beat Ipswich in midweek and could claim his place back in the centre of defence.City will have their 34 million Brazilian ace back in the squad after he was rested midweek, although reports are that he took the opportunity to return home to Brazil and is only due back on Friday night. Hughes will have to asses if the record signing will be fit on Sunday morning.City are buzzing after despatching Portsmouth 6-0 last week, but confidence will have taken a knock with the early dumping out of the cup in midweek. They lost on Penalties to league one outfit Brighton, showing that they aren't the 'top four' contenders the City backroom are trying to spin.Latics on the other hand are coming off the back of a resounding win at Ipswich, showing that they can defend well like they had to do in the first half at Ipswich and throughout the game at Spurs at the weekend. But as we all know this team also has goals a plenty in it and if the visitors are complacent, they will be punished.Latics will probably field a similar squad to that which got us through to the fourth round of the Carling Cup and City will revert back to last weeks team.It has the makings of a cracking game of football in front of the Sky cameras and Steve Bruce will be hoping that we can keep up the unbeaten record against City and if we play like we can we should be able to get the result. I'll go for a confident 2-1 Latics win.Click Here For The City View  Head To Head - League W D L F A Home 2 1 1 9 5 Away 2 1 1 2 1 Total 4 2 2 11 6 For all previous results between Wigan Athletic v Manchester City Click Here Current League Positions Pld W D L F A GD Pts Pos Manchester City 5 3 0 2 15 7 +8 9 5th Wigan Athletic 5 1 2 2 7 4 +3 5 14th Recent Record Latics W D L F A GD Last 6 Games 3 2 1 14 3 +11 Man City W D L F A GD Last 6 Games 4 1 1 15 6 +9 Foul Play Latics Manchester City Games 08/09 Yellow Cards Red Cards Games 08/09 Yellow Cards Red Cards 7 6 1 7 10 0 Average 0.86 0.14 Average 1.43 0 This Weekend In History Wigan games from: 2, 6, 9 and 16 years agoOPPONENTS GROUND RES ATT. 06-07 WATFORD JJB STADIUM 1-1 16,359 02-03 BARNSLEY OAKWELL 3-1 9,977 99-00 CARDIFF CITY NINIAN PARK 0-0 7,679 92-93 BURNLEY SPRINGFIELD PARK 1-1 4,032 Fixtures 27th September 2008 Arsenal Vs Hull City Aston Villa Vs Sunderland Everton Vs Liverpool Fulham Vs West Ham Manchester United Vs Bolton Wanderers Newcastle United Vs Blackburn Rovers Stoke City
