He insisted money was not the reason, saying he wanted a longterm contract and guarantees he would remain manager if Ashley manages to sell Newcastle.No deal: Ashley could not tempt Venables to manage NewcastleWith Ashley touting the club around the world, and coming close to a serious bid from a Chinese consortium which will match his 450million asking price, he was unable to match Venables demands and the deal fell through last night.The desperate Newcastle hierarchy are now likely to return to former England and Chelsea boss Glenn Hoddle who has also turned the job down because of the uncertainty surrounding its future ownership.Another fallback option could be former Wimbledon boss Dave Bassett, who is close to Newcastles executive director (football) Dennis Wise.Venables, who was first contacted by the Newcastle board earlier this week, held talks with Wise and Tony Jimenez in London yesterday but rejected the initial concept of working on a game-by-game basis.Hours of talks failed to resolve the problem, even though Ashley was prepared to offer Venables a major cash bonus to accept his terms and be prepared to walk out the moment a new owner takes over.Chris Hughton will continue as caretaker manager of Newcastle Venabless rejection leaves caretaker manager Chris Hughton in charge for Blackburns visit to St James Park tomorrow.
