Sir Alex Ferguson accused general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Board Hackett of stepping in to get Terry off the hook after referee Mark Halsey refused to overturn his original decision. However, the a spokesman for the PGMO said: 'All matters of discipline are an issue for the FA - and them alone.' Indeed, Ferguson could now find himself in trouble with the Football Association over his latest outburst. Having already seen Nemanja Vidic suspended following his sending off at Liverpool, the United manager at least felt Terry's absence would even the situation up in Sunday's Barclays Premier League encounter between the two sides. 'Hackett told Halsey to rescind the red card but he would not do it,' said Ferguson. 'If it had been a Manchester United player Hackett would not have done this.' Halsey has not commented on the matter and has been informed he will take charge of the Coca-Cola League Two encounter between Chester and Shrewsbury on Sunday.
