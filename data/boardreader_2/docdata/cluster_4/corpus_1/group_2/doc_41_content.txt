My intention is that Manchester City has the very best people at its disposal, both on and off the field."We are ambitious for the club, like you, but not unreasonably so and we understand it takes time to build a team capable of sustaining a presence in the top four of the Premier League and winning European honours."We know a little of the history at City also and whilst we want to bring in the best players in the world, we also want to see the academy continue to develop talent and give Mark Hughes the chance to bring -grown players into the team."Sheikh Mansour added: "We consider Mark Hughes to be one of the prime assets of the club. We will back his judgement in what players to bring in and we look forward to working  closely with him in the future. We are building a structure for the future not just a team of all-stars."
