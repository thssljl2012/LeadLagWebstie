Tim Cahill and Leon Osman struck as Everton fought back from a two-goal deficit to grab a 2-2 draw at Hull.Hull had looked like adding to their superb start in the Barclays Premier League with another win, after scoring following corners through Michael Turner and a Phil Neville own goal.But Everton finished a thrilling contest the stronger and were awarded a goal when Cahill's shot bounced down off the bar after 73 minutes - and Osman levelled five minutes later.The draw was a huge relief for Everton, who again had problems at the back. It was the exposure of those defensive frailties in Thursday's UEFA Cup clash against Standard Liege that led to David Moyes' decision to relegate England international Joleon Lescott to the bench. Hull grabbed the lead when Turner rose highest at the far post to meet Dean Marney's cross and send a header back over Tim Howard. Hull's corners created problems and led to a second goal for the hosts after 48 minutes. Marney again delivered into the box, and this time Neville headed past his own goalkeeper and into the net - before Marlon King could get the final touch. Persistence paid off when Everton pulled one back after 73 minutes through Cahill, although it took a brave decision from the officials. Kamil Zayatte could only stab his clearance from an Osman shot at Cahill - and the Australian blasted a shot against the bar which bounced down, according to the referee's assistant, over the line. Everton claimed their equaliser with 12 minutes remaining when Ayegbeni Yakubu played a one-two with Louis Saha and crossed for Osman, who got ahead of Boaz Myhill and volleyed in from close range.
