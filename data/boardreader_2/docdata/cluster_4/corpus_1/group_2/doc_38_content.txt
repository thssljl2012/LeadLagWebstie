Chelsea hope to have John Terry available for their match against Manchester United after they submitted a claim for wrongful dismissal following his straight red card against Manchester City.The England and Chelsea skipper was sent off after he brought down Brazilian striker Jo in their Barclays Premier League clash at Eastlands on Saturday.A mistake by Deco in the 77th minute had allowed Jo a run at the Blues' defence and as the City forward went past the 27-year-old defender he put out an arm to impede the run.Terry was guilty of a cynical foul but Jo still had a long way to go to goal and Ricardo Carvalho was in close attendance which made it a debatable call by referee Mark Halsey.The Football Association confirmed on www.thefa.com that Chelsea had submitted a claim for wrongful dismissal and an FA regulatory commission will consider the claim on September 16.Leisure articlesWhat is it about chefs that makes them want to destroy fresh crisp cabbage with some sort of redcurrant jelly?After an Anglezarke ramble my daughter and I were famished and ready for a hearty meal so we ventured to The Robin Hood, in rural Mawdesley.I had been trying to book a table at the White Bull for weeks - every time I was told 'Sorry we're fully booked'.That close knit village feel is so tangible at The Original Farmers Arms.I hadn't had fish and chips for ages so when I saw it on the menu at the Euxton Mills pub I jumped at it straight away for a midweek lunch, knowing I'd be working late.
