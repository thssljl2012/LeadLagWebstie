JOE Kinnear was yesterday appointed as interim Newcastle United manager " and immediately forecast the Kevin Keegan-Alan Shearer dream ticket could be in place within weeks. The club's owner Mike Ashley sprang a major surprise yesterday afternoon when he asked the 61-year-old former Wimbledon, Luton and Nottingham Forest manager to step into the breach after Terry Venables rejected the temporary post on Thursday night.Caretaker manager Chris Hughton will be in the dug-out for today's vital Barclays Premier League clash with Blackburn, but Kinnear will then take over on a contract which will run until the end of October.That suggests a timeframe for the sale of the club is firmly in place. 'I think the club's going to be sold at the beginning of October and Chris Hughton needs all the help he can get,' said Kinnear.'So if I can get in there and get a few results together until obviously the two main people are named, I assume from the new people coming in they will be Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer.'Investment bankers Seymour Pierce are actively seeking a buyer after billionaire Ashley decided he had had enough following mass protests in the wake of Kevin Keegan's resignation three weeks ago.In a statement, Kinnear added: 'I am very excited about the challenge in front of me.'Results have not been great of late, but there is a lot of quality in the squad and I am very confident the players are capable of climbing the league table.'Newcastle United is a great club. When I was in charge of Wimbledon, I always remember the passion of the fans up there and how great a stadium St James' Park is. It is a big challenge, but one I am really looking forward to.'Kinnear admitted he was stunned to receive an approach from St James' Park.'It was a call out of the blue, to be honest. The fans are going to be disappointed (by the appointment], I am aware of that and I can do nothing about that.'My shoulders are broad enough to take any criticism.'It is understood Ashley took charge of the search for a stop-gap manager personally after executive director (football] Dennis Wise and vice- president (player recruitment] Tony Jimenez failed to find a successor for Keegan.The Tynesiders had already shelved plans to appoint a permanent replacement with the issue of the club's future ownership doing little to aid their recruitment drive.But with Venables having turned down the chance to take over and Glenn Hoddle apparently giving little cause for optimism, Ashley moved decisively to put someone in place with the situation on the field rapidly spiralling out of control after four successive defeats.The move is likely to be greeted with incredulity by fans, who believe the club has been reduced to a laughing stock in recent weeks, and for them the sooner the issue of Ashley's disastrous tenure is resolved the better.Kinnear may represent a safe pair of hands and certainly has experience but he is unlikely to be the long-term solution.In the meantime, Ashley's efforts to sell the club he bought for 134.4m 16 months ago appear to be gathering pace.A Nigerian consortium has been talking up hopes of doing a deal in recent days and interestingly, they have signalled their intention to bring Keegan back to St James' Park to finish the job he started for the second time in January.The link with Shearer is intriguing " the two men held lengthy talks after Keegan took over from Sam Allardyce " but decided not to work together as manager and number two, although the door was left open. There has also been talk of serious interest from both China and the United States, and with Ashley looking to cut his losses, there could be movement soon.But whoever buys the club will hope the situation on the pitch has improved markedly under Kinnear.Successive league defeats by Arsenal, Hull and West Ham have left the Magpies second from bottom and a failure today could see them drop to the foot of the table.Hughton, who has lost striker Obafemi Martins for six weeks with a knee injury and midfielder Ignacio Gonzalez with an Achilles problem, said: 'When you are on a run as we are at the moment, there is no doubt it affects the confidence.'But there is quality in the side. It has been a tough time, everybody is aware of that, but you can only do what you can do.' Profile - Joe Kinnear1946: Joe Kinnear born in Dublin, 27 December.1965: Joins Tottenham from St Albans.
