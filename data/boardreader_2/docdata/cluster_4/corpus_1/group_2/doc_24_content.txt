Pregnant bank worker punched during raid   Next Next  Published Date: 17 September 2008 A six-month pregnant bank worker was punched in the face during an armed robbery in Salford. The 19-year-old woman was assaulted as three balaclava-clad men struck at Barclays Bank in Anchorage Quay at about 5pm on Tuesday.They threatened members of staff inside the branch as they demanded the cash and the pregnant worker was grabbed by the arm and attacked.Police said the men were armed with a shotgun and a hammer.No shots were fire and no-one was seriously injured as the raiders left empty-handed and made off in a dark blue Mercedes, which was later found abandoned near the Broadway Pub in Broadway.The offenders are described as being about 5ft 8in, with slim builds and wearing dark clothing. Detective Sergeant Joanne Kay said: "Nobody was seriously injured in this attack, but a pregnant woman was punched in the face, and all of the victims have been left badly shaken. "A number of witnesses have already come forward, but we still need more information to help us piece together the offenders' movements in the moments after the robbery."
