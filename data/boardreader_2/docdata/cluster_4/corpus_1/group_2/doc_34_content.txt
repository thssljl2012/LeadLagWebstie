Terry Venables has turned down the chance to take temporary charge of Newcastle, according to reports.The former England boss today held a second round of talks with the club's hierarchy in London with the Magpies looking to push through plans to appoint an interim manager.However, reports in various media outlets on Thursday evening suggest the 65-year-old will not be making the move to St James' Park.A crowd of just 20,577 turned up to watch Newcastle slip out of the Carling Cup at home to holders Tottenham on Wednesday night, when defensive errors and a crippling lack of confidence allowed Spurs to put their own woes behind them.The Magpies face Blackburn in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday when the rebellion against owner Mike Ashley is likely to increase in volume if they do not end a run of four successive defeats.
