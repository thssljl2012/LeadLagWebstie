MICHAEL Carrick looks certain to miss the start of Manchester United's Champions League defence against Villarreal on Wednesday night - while Dimitar Berbatov also missed the start of training this morning. Midfielder Carrick was a major doubt anyway after limping out of Saturday's Barclays Premier League defeat at Liverpool with an ankle injury, but Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to take a place on the bench. The fact that Carrick was not on the training ground as United were put through their paces in front of Sir Alex Ferguson merely appeared to confirm the former Tottenham man's inevitable absence against the Spaniards. Berbatov's non-appearance was more of a surprise. The Bulgarian striker took a knock at Anfield but did complete the full 90 minutes and was expected to be part of Ferguson's squad for their first Champions League game since beating Chelsea in a penalty shoot-out to lift the trophy in Moscow last May. There has been no word on whether the 27-year-old has a chance of being fit, although Ferguson will no doubt hope he is. However, if Berbatov is missing, at least United should have Angolan forward Manucho available. Manucho has recovered from a broken metatarsal and with his work permit also secure is now looking to break into the first-team picture. Prospective world footballer of the year Ronaldo was tipped for a comeback by Ferguson this week following news of a speedier than expected recovery. Ronaldo will almost certainly start on the bench for a game which sees Paul Scholes suspended due to his sending-off in the UEFA Super Cup encounter with Zenit St Petersburg in Monaco last month. What team would you select against Villarreal? Have your say.
