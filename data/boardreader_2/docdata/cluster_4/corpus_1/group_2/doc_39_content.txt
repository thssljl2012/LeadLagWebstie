Billionaire Mike Ashley has confirmed he wants to sell Newcastle just 16 months after staging a 134.4million takeover.Ashley and his executive director (football) Dennis Wise have borne the brunt of a furious backlash from supporters in the 10 days since manager Kevin Keegan walked out in protest over the club's transfer policy.In a lengthy statement, Ashley said: 'I am putting the club up for sale. I hope that the fans get what they want and that the next owner is someone who can lavish the amount of money on the club that the fans want.'He added: 'I am not stupid and have listened to the fans.'I have really loved taking my kids to the games, being next to them and all the fans.'But I am now a dad who can't take his kids to a football game on a Saturday because I am advised that we would be assaulted.'Therefore, I am no longer prepared to subsidise Newcastle United.'Thousands staged demonstrations outside St James' Park before and after Saturday's embarrassing 2-1 Barclays Premier League defeat by Hull demanding that Ashley sell up and that Wise be removed from his post.Leisure articlesWhat is it about chefs that makes them want to destroy fresh crisp cabbage with some sort of redcurrant jelly?After an Anglezarke ramble my daughter and I were famished and ready for a hearty meal so we ventured to The Robin Hood, in rural Mawdesley.I had been trying to book a table at the White Bull for weeks - every time I was told 'Sorry we're fully booked'.That close knit village feel is so tangible at The Original Farmers Arms.I hadn't had fish and chips for ages so when I saw it on the menu at the Euxton Mills pub I jumped at it straight away for a midweek lunch, knowing I'd be working late.
