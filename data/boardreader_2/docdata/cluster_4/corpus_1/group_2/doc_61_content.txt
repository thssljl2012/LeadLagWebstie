'The key to it was he was determined to leave Real Madrid. But I don't think it was a case of being convenient.'We pitched to him, we said 'listen, this is where we need to go and we're going to bring in good players. We already have good players at our club and they will help you perform to a high standard'.'Initially he showed signs of being apprehensive about the situation he found himself in but he's had great support from his Brazil colleagues here - Elano, Jo and Glauber Berti.'That apprehension went very, very quickly.'And the former Blackburn and Wales boss believes Robinho is now set to enjoy a fine career with City, where he will get the adulation he lacked at the Bernabeu.'When he was at Madrid he wanted to play every week and felt he wasn't getting that chance. Maybe he felt he wasn't going to be loved as much as, obviously, he is here,' Hughes added.Barclays Prem 2009/10 Win Outright: Man City 10/1
