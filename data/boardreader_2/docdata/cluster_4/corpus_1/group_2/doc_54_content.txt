Former England boss Terry Venables will decide on Thursday whether to become interim manager of troubled Newcastle.Venables held talks with the club on Wednesday and is the latest in the frame to take over since the departure of Kevin Keegan and the decision of owner Mike Ashley to put the club up for sale.'I can confirm I met Newcastle representatives on Wednesday,' Venables told The Sun. 'Those talks will continue on Thursday morning when, hopefully, I can give them a final decision.'Venables is understood to have held talks with Newcastle vice-president Tony Jimenez, managing director Derek Llambias and executive director Dennis Wise in London with a view to persuade the 65-year-old to take over control of first team affairs from Chris Hughton.Venables previously held talks with Newcastle in September 2004 when he was in discussion with then chairman Freddy Shepherd to succeed the sacked Sir Bobby Robson but the job eventually went to Graeme Souness.Newcastle's 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham in the Carling Cup third round on Wednesday was a fourth successive loss for a team also struggling in the lower reaches of the Barclays Premier League.The Magpies' beleaguered supporters voted with their feet as a crowd of just 20,577 - the lowest for a competitive match at St James' Park since the capacity was increased to in excess of 52,000 - turned up to see them lose to Spurs.EDITORS CHOICEWHEN 20-year-old Elizabeth Gough left Droitwich Spa for India in the late 60s little could have prepared her for the life she would eventually lead.PLANS to transform an area of Droitwich Spa with entertainment and retail facilities are set to take a major step forward.VILLAGERS in Cutnall Green now have a long-awaited regular bus service to Droitwich Spa.MATT Neal clinched an overall fifth place finish in the British Touring Car Championship after the final rounds at Brands Hatch.Droitwich 28 RFCSilhillians 17TWO musical teachers sang their way through the weekend to raise cash for the MS Society.
