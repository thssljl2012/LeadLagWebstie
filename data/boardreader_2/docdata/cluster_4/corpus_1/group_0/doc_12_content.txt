 Anna Whitehouse found a quick and novel way to pick up her holiday money before travelling to Spain. Rather than queuing at a bureau de change, she put her debit card into a cash machine, tapped in her Pin number and out popped a handful of euro notes.Easy Money: Anna Whitehouse found the M&amp;amp;S machine quick and simple to useWANT TO KNOW MORE?OTHER STORIESSAVINGS TABLESFind the best savings account to suit you from our entirely independent comparison tables:  Top savings ratesISA FINDEROur comparison tool can help find the best savings rates on the market: &gt;&gt; Best savings accountsHOW TO PICK AN ISABest accounts, best funds...

There was no queuing, no fuss. I saw the exchange rate on the screen and I had 400 euros in less than a minute.'The exchange rate offered through the M&amp;amp;S cash machines is identical to the one it charges over the counter.M&amp;amp;S has more than 20 such machines in stores around the UK - and it is not alone. Halifax, Tesco, HSBC  the Post Office, RBS and private bank Raphaels have also installed more than 100 machines between them that can dispense euros and/or US dollars.Tesco spokesman Matthew Dransfield says: 'We thought it made sense to put these machines near transport hubs. For example, we have one at a shop not far from East Midlands Airport and another near Gatwick Airport.'But the machines are also appearing in High Streets and shopping centres across the country.Anna, who lives in Salford, Manchester, says: 'I will definitely use a euro currency machine again and I have recommended it to friends.'Fraser Millar, head of travel money at M&amp;amp;S Money, says: 'We hope to have about 150 of these cash machines by this time next year.''A typical transaction over the counter takes three-and-a-half minutes. It is about a minute using one of our new cash machines.'And the cash machines will usually be cheaper than swapping cash at the airport or withdrawing currency from a foreign ATM.In virtually all cases, a withdrawal of foreign currency in the UK will count as a normal cash transaction. This means it avoids currency surcharges that are applied to cash machines abroad (see below).The exception is Barclays, which insists its 2% foreign currency surcharge must apply to withdrawals made through multi-currency cash machines.A spokeswoman says: 'We've had this reviewed by our lawyers and they say we need to be consistent on international currency charges throughout Europe.'Fees - What banks chargeUsing cash machines while abroad will cost UK holidaymakers a massive 284m this year in charges, says website moneyexpert.com.As well as any fees levied by the bank that owns the machine, your own bank is also likely to make a surcharge on the exchange rate used to convert your withdrawal back into sterling, typically 2.75% plus a transaction fee.This fee varies. For example, NatWest charges 2% of the transaction value with a minimum of 2 and maximum of 5.But these fees do not apply to euros or dollars taken out of UK cash machines. The only charge is the mark-up on exchange rates by the bank running the machine. This varies from about 2.5 to 7%, depending on location.Plan ahead to get the best deals. Online currency dealer, FairFX, says that someone ordering 200 in advance through its site could get up to 28 euros more for their money than from a typical airport bureau de change.Even after a 5 charge for home delivery, the customer would still be 20 euros (16) better off.Help with currency rates TABLES: Latest exchange rates TABLES: Latest tourist rates 30-SECOND GUIDE: Exchange rates A cheap way to move money abroad
