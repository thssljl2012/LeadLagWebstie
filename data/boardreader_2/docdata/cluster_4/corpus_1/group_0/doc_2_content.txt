 Cash-strapped Kiwis considering a loan to get themselves out of a financial hole could end up paying almost twice as much as they borrowed to clear the debt.The Herald on Sunday obtained one quote which would require more than $25,000 to repay a $15,000 loan over four years.Our investigation also revealed borrowers were likely to pay hundreds of dollars in administration fees - and could be locked into repayment terms of up to five years.The figures have shocked budget advisers and Consumer New Zealand, which warned people to shop around for the best deals and to calculate the true cost of any loan, especially in today's high-interest market.Our investigation involved comparing the interest rates and terms offered by four finance companies, a broker and a high-street bank.We asked how much we could borrow for a new car, using the same set of circumstances - a single woman with no dependants in her mid-20s with a monthly income of about $2600 after tax. With no hire purchases, a good credit history and one credit card, our application also included a $4000 deposit towards the vehicle.All loan offers were based on initial phone quotes and lenders stressed they could change further down the process. But the amount companies thought we could pay back comfortably varied widely, from $9500 over 39 months, to a whopping $26,000 over 48.It paid to shop around to find the best interest rates, but even using the joint lowest rate quoted - 14.95 per cent from broker Active Finance - a $15,000 car could still end up costing more than $25,000 over five years, with loan protection insurance included.ASB Bank's $25,000 would see us repay almost $36,000 at the same rate over the same period, but that was without income protection insurance.The highest interest rate quoted was Future Finance's 23.95 per cent, although the cautious staff member pointed out that she was basing this on a 'worst-possible case' scenario, pending further financial security details.At Kiwi Loans, the staff member we spoke to was far more generous, telling us we could easily afford a $20,000 car, and even stretch to a $30,000 model if we wanted. He encouraged us to sign up on the spot, citing pre-approval of a loan within a couple of hours. Most companies said they would not service an unsecured loan of any kind, although most suggested finding a guarantor. The exception was Active Finance, which said the maximum car loan it could arrange was $15,000, using the new car as security. But it also said it might be possible to arrange a $5000 unsecured cash loan, which came with an interest rate of 22.95 per cent, including more than $700 in fees. Paid back over four years, the combined loan could reach about $33,000.
