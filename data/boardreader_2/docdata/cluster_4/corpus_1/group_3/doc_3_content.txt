Police are continuing their questioning of two men over the murder of a banker who died following a city centre brawl in Norwich.Detectives on Wednesday charged 21-year-old Daniel Moy, of Costessey, near Norwich, with assaulting Frank McGarahan's cousin in Norwich in the early hours of Sunday.A spokesman said the charge did not relate to the death of the chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth.Two men - in their early 20s and from the Norwich area - are still being questioned over the death after magistrates granted a warrant for the further detention of the pair, police said.A police spokesman said Moy has been released on bail and will appear before Norwich Magistrates' Court on October 15.Mr McGarahan, of Much Hadham, Herts, had been enjoying a night out in Norwich before a family christening.Police said he remonstrated with a group of men after seeing a Lithuanian man and his girlfriend attacked.He was hurt after an 'exchange of words' with the gang after walking about 20 yards from a taxi rank to confront the group, Detective Superintendent Chris Hobley said.Police initially thought the Lithuanian victim was homeless but said on Wednesday night that 'subsequent inquiries' had revealed he had an address in the city.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
