A doorman who went to the aid of murdered banker Frank McGarahan told last night how 12 thugs continued to attack him even as he lay unconscious.Darryl Lawton described how the gang was 'really laying into' the 45-year-old and his cousin who were both on the ground when he arrived at the scene.'If I had been there just a few seconds earlier I could have saved Frank,' Mr Lawton said last night.The 42-year-old bouncer had been clearing up at a club in Norwich city centre at 3am on Sunday when he heard the fight.He ran to help Mr McGarahan and two relatives, who themselves had tried to help a homeless Lithuanian man and his girlfriend who were being set upon by the thugs.But when he saw the position of the banker's body he feared that he was already dead.'There must have been 12 young men in the gang which was violently assaulting two men on the floor,' said Mr Lawton, who suffered a broken jaw when they turned on him after he grabbed their ringleader.'They were really laying into them,' he said. 'I could see that one of them - Frank - was unconscious. Another man - Frank's brother - was being pinned up against a shop window.'They kicked me and punched me in the head and back. I took as much as I could, but I had to let go of the guy I was holding. I am gutted that I let go.'When I turned around I could see that Frank was dead.'Scene of murder: The Taxi Rank on Guildhall Hill in Norwich where Frank McGarahan was assaultedMr Lawton, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, added: 'The whole thing must have been over in 30 seconds. I am so gutted that I wasn't there earlier.'Police investigating the murder said yesterday they had arrested three men and appealed for more witnesses to come forward.The men are all in their early 20s and are from the Norwich area. A spokesman said the men were being held at police stations across Norfolk.The scene of the murder is only 300yards from Norfolk police's operational headquarters, although it is closed to the public between midnight and 8am.It emerged yesterday that police have CCTV pictures of Mr McGarahan remonstrating with the gang after going to the aid of the couple. It is understood officers also have images of the assault.Mr McGarahan was the chief operating officer with Barclays Wealth, the bespoke finance arm which caters for the bank's richest customers, and managed their combined assets of 133billion.On Saturday evening the family went out for dinner ahead of a christening the following day.His wife Alison, 42, a former flight attendant, and their two children, aged seven and four months, returned to their hotel but Mr McGarahan stayed out for a drink with his brother Kevin and a cousin.The trio were waiting for a taxi when they saw the 35-year-old man and his 45-year- old girlfriend being assaulted.Another of Mr McGarahan's brothers, Tony, said the banker could not 'stand by and watch' as thugs attacked a defenceless couple.'We will never under-stand how or why anyone could murder such a decent, caring and loving man,' he said.'We will never comprehend it or truly recover from it.'Tony McGarahan is the interim communications manager of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley and was dealing with media calls about the troubled bank the night before his brother's murder.Speaking outside his brother's home in Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, he said: 'Throughout Frank's alltooshort life he always wanted to help others.'Last Saturday, he did what was natural to him to try and help someone.'He added: 'Frank has paid the ultimate price of life for being a good citizen.'We are all devastated by our loss', he said. 'He was simply a great family man.'Detective Superintendent Chris Hobley of Norfolk Police said Mr McGarahan had not physically tried to break-up the fight but had merely ' had words' with the gang.The tragedy has highlighted the dangers of going to someone's aid and Mr Hobley said: 'He has clearly taken a view on somebody suffering an assault and that view is understandable. I don't think he would have expected this outcome.'The homeless couple required hospital treatment.
