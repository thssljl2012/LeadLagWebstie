Chelsea striker Didier Drogba is expected to face only a short spell on the sidelines following the injury he sustained against CFR Cluj.The Ivory Coast international left the stadium of Chelsea's Champions League opponents with his right leg in a brace after Wednesday night's goalless draw.He underwent a scan on Thursday and it is understood the results show that Drogba sustained no significant ligament damage.If he had sustained a major ligament injury Chelsea would have been forced to cope without their first-choice frontman for several months.However the early signs point to it being a matter of weeks rather than months before Drogba becomes available again to manager Luiz Felipe Scolari.Drogba sustained forceful rotations to his right knee and ankle when his leg appeared to buckle as he went to make contact with a cross against the Romanians.Chelsea are set to keep him under observation for the next two to three days before revealing precisely how long Drogba faces out of action, however there will be no need for surgery.Chelsea could still be down to the bare bones for Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Aston Villa.Drogba is a certain absentee and Scolari was already sure to be without Deco, Joe Cole, Michael Essien and Ricardo Carvalho.Ashley Cole sat out Wednesday's game with a sore back while John Terry (back) and Alex (buttock) both finished it in pain.Editor's ChoiceNEW poems from some of Stroud's finest wordsmiths will accompany this year's Stroud Water Textile Festival.DJ JAGDISH Patel is one of Stroud FM's new radio presenters.WHY is it that three quintessentially English roles have gone to a couple of Americans and one Australian? Having just won two substantial Oscars this year it must be plain for any idiot to see that Britain has talent. So when this film's director Justin Chadwick says they were just perfect for the roles because 'they're great actors', it sticks in my craw. Though it is fair to say the Australian Cate Blanchett did a fine job as Queen Elizabeth I, I still think that it is insulting to Americans to assume they would be unable to cope with an unknown name in the lead, but it is an even greater insult to us. We have a treasure trove of talent in this country that is struggling to get noticed in a profession in which 88% are out of work. But we also have a myriad of big names as well, so shame on you Mr. Chadwick.SET in the early 1980s this film is based on the true story of hard drinking womaniser Charlie Wilson, who also had a penchant for coke. He was the liberal Democrat congressman from Texas said to have been totally responsible for organising the biggest undercover operation in the history of the United States. This involved supplying the Afghan Mujahideen with arms during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the success of which unfortunately was the beginning of a very tricky future for the Afghan nation.
