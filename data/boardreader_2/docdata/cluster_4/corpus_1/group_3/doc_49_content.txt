Frank McGarahan paid 'the ultimate price', his brother saidPolice questioning two men over the murder of a banker who died following a city centre fight have been granted more time to continue their interviews.Detectives have charged Daniel Moy, 21, of Costessey, near Norwich, with assaulting Frank McGarahan's cousin in Norwich in the early hours of Sunday. He has been bailed to appear before Norwich magistrates on 15 October. A spokesman said the charge did not relate to the death of the chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth. Two men - in their early 20s and from the Norwich area - are still being questioned over the death after magistrates granted a warrant for the further detention of the pair, police said. Floral tributesMr McGarahan, of Much Hadham in Hertfordshire, had been on a night out in Norwich before a family christening at Norwich's Roman Catholic Cathedral. Police said he remonstrated with a group of men after seeing a Lithuanian man and his girlfriend attacked. He was fatally injured following an 'exchange of words' after walking about 20 yards from a taxi rank to confront the group, Det Supt Chris Hobley said. Police initially thought the Lithuanian victim was homeless but have said 'subsequent inquiries' had revealed he had an address in the city. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the incident yesterday. A message attached to one of the bunches of flowers read: 'We taxi drivers salute you for your courage and bravery.'
