Didier Drogba suffered suspected knee ligament damage in Chelsea's 0-0 Champions League draw with CFR Cluj.The Ivory Coast striker left the stadium on crutches and with his right leg in a brace as he travelled separately from the rest of the team.Drogba could be facing a long lay-off - and he adds to a growing list of injury concerns for Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League game against Aston Villa.Chelsea are already without Joe Cole, Deco and Michael Essien while Ricardo Carvalho is sidelined for another fortnight and Ashley Cole missed out in Romania with lower back pain.On top of that, John Terry finished the game holding his back and Alex also picked up a knock in a tough Champions League encounter in Transylvania.Scolari will not know the full extent of any injuries until Thursday, although he hopes Ashley Cole will be fit for the weekend.Drogba's right knee appeared to jar as he tried to get on the end of a Florent Malouda cross. Scolari said: 'It was not the pitch, there are normally some problems in the game, in training, so we don't say the pitch is bad. Sometimes it happens in football. 'I didn't see the challenge on Drogba. Injuries come in training and on the pitch. This is normal for players.'
