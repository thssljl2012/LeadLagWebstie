olice question three suspects over banker murder  Detectives are interviewing three men in their early 20s after a banker who intervened in a street fight died in hospital. Officers investigating the death of Frank McGarahan, 45, from Hertfordshire, arrested the three males yesterday afternoon and spent the evening quizzing them about the incident. Questioning is due to continue this morning, a spokesperson for Norfolk police said last night, at the police stations across Norfolk where they are being held. Mr McGarahan sustained fatal injuries after intervening in an assault taking place on Guildhall Hill in Norwich town centre at around 03:00 BST on Sunday. The chief operating officer for Barclays Wealth had been queuing at a cash machine when he witnessed the assault after what police described as a 'quiet evening out with family and friends'. Mr McGarahan was rushed to hospital but died yesterday at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge. Both his brother and his cousin were also involved in the incident. The cousin required hospital treatment while a bouncer working at a club nearby suffered a broken jaw. 'Norwich city centre is generally a safe place and there were a number of people in the vicinity of the incident,' Detective Superintendent Chris Hobley of Norfolk police said. 'We are very keen to hear from anyone who may have seen something or has any information.' Police will hold a press conference later this morning. Anyone with any information relating to the incident is asked to contact the investigation team at Norwich constabulary on 0845 2562567 or anonymously on Crimestoppers on 0800555 111. Mr McGarahan had been due to attend a family christening on Sunday.
