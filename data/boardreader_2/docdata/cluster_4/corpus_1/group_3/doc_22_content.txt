The Telegraph reports: Frank McGarahan, 45, was attacked as he stepped in to stop a gang beating up the Lithuanian, who was walking his dog with his girlfriend. Instead the group of at least four men, aged in their late teens and early 20s, turned on Mr McGarahan, the chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, punching and kicking him as he lay unconscious on the pavement. His brother Anthony, the interim communications manager for Bradford and Bingley, said: 'We will never understand how or why anyone could murder such a decent, caring and loving man. We will never comprehend it or truly recover from it. 'Everyone who knew Frank remembers him as a kind, considerate, generous and funny man.' Mr McGarahan, one of six brothers, had been out with his family in Norwich on Saturday night ahead of his niece's christening the next day. After a meal at a tapas restaurant his wife, Alison, and their children went back to their hotel while Mr McGarahan went out for a few more drinks. As he waited in a taxi queue with his brother, Kevin, and a cousin at 3am, the group of youths began abusing the homeless man 20 yards away. As the situation turned violent, Mr McGarahan stepped in to try and protect him and verbally diffuse the situation when he was attacked. Anthony McGarahan said at first it appeared there were only four members of the group but then a lot more 'came out of nowhere'.
