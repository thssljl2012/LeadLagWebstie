   quote   Stealth107     I&amp;#039;m sure Rooney would be celebrating a little bit harder last night after having his first ruled out very harshly.  Pleased with a 0-0 draw aginast Villa. Harry got the tactics right by not starting Belhadj (but when he came on it looked like he&amp;#039;d been shot out a cannon  ). Pamarot gives us more defensive steel. Not pleased Davis was sent of so harshly. We&amp;#039;re already very, very short in center midfield. Looks like Mvumeba and Diop next match unless Diarra or Hughes get themselves fit.   Yesterday, Portsmouth seemed to lack someone in the attacking midfield role to link the midfield to Crouch and Defoe, at times they seemed a bit isolated.  After the linesman got hit in the head with a coin, Luke Young then cleared the ball which also hit the same linesman square in the face. Not a good day for him
