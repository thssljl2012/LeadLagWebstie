         Foul-mouthed Kinnear gets FA warning      The Football Association have warned Newcastle boss Joe Kinnear he could face disciplinary action if he swears in any future public outburst.   Kinnear gave an expletive-packed press conference on October 2, when he swore more than 50 times.  The press conference was called to look ahead to the Barclays Premier League match against Everton, but he came out fighting with an onslaught of his own against newspaper journalists he believes have ridiculed him and tried to undermine his position.  The FA said in a statement today: &amp;amp;quot;Newcastle United manager Joe Kinnear has been reminded of his responsibilities by The FA in relation to comments made at a press briefing on October 2.  &amp;amp;quot;The FA has received an apology from Kinnear for any offence that his comments may have caused.  &amp;amp;quot;The FA has borne into consideration the specific context in which the comments were made and the fact that the comments were made in a closed forum.  &amp;amp;quot;While he will not face any formal disciplinary action on this occasion, he has been advised that in the event of similar public comments, disciplinary proceedings may be brought against him.&amp;amp;quot;       ESPNsoccernet
