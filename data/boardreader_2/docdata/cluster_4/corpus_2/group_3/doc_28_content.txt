            Quote from: RyanBabel19 on  Today  at 01:11:30 AM   Am I the only one that has seen this from tomorrows newspapers   Paul Ince ready to raid former club Liverpool and take Astrit Ajdarevic to Blackburn  Blackburn manager Paul Ince wants to hand Liverpool midfielder Astrit Ajdarevic a chance to stay in the Barclays Premier League.  The Swedish starlet, 18, has failed to progress from Liverpool&amp;amp;#039;s FA Youth Cup-winning side but Ince wants him on trial after being tipped off about his potential by a Rovers scouting department full of former Anfield staff.   Just scraps that we didnt want. He doesnt have the mobility to cut it in the PL, imo.
