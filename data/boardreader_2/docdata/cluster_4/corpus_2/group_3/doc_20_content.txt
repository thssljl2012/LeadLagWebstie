 Premier League official site :   Quote:   Stoke City&amp;#039;s three-goal leading scorer   Ricardo Fuller   is unlikely to play from the start against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday after playing two World Cup qualifiers for Jamaica in the past week.    Mamady Sidibe   is expected to start the Barclays Premier League match in Fuller&amp;#039;s place, while defender   Abdoulaye Faye   will take a late fitness test on a groin strain picked up on international duty with Senegal.   Ibrahima Sonko   is on standby.  Winger   Liam Lawrence   remains absent with a sprained ankle and defender   Andrew Davies   is to see a specialist after suffering a setback in his recuperation from a knee injury.
