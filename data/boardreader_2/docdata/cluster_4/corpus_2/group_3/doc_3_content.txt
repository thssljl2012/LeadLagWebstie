         Frustrated Scolari bemoans Drogba injury      Didier Drogba suffered suspected knee ligament damage in Chelsea&amp;#039;s 0-0 Champions League draw with CFR Cluj.     Chelsea&amp;#039;s Didier Drogba goes off injured in Cluj  The Ivory Coast striker left the stadium on crutches and with his right leg in a brace as he travelled separately from the rest of the team.  Drogba could be facing a long lay-off - and he adds to a growing list of injury concerns for Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari ahead of Sunday&amp;#039;s Barclays Premier League game against Aston Villa.  Chelsea are already without Joe Cole, Deco and Michael Essien while Ricardo Carvalho is sidelined for another fortnight and Ashley Cole missed out tonight with lower back pain.  On top of that, John Terry finished the game holding his back and Alex also picked up a knock in a tough Champions League encounter in Transylvania.  Scolari will not know the full extent of any injuries until tomorrow, although he hopes Ashley Cole will be fit for the weekend after he missed tonight&amp;#039;s game with lower back pain.  Drogba&amp;#039;s right knee appeared to jar as he tried to get on the end of a Florent Malouda cross.  Scolari said: &amp;amp;quot;It was not the pitch, there are normally some problems in the game, in training, so we don&amp;#039;t say the pitch is bad. Sometimes it happens in football.  &amp;amp;quot;I didn&amp;#039;t see the challenge on Drogba. Injuries come in training and on the pitch. This is normal for players.&amp;amp;quot;  As for the result, Scolari was satisfied with the draw given how Chelsea struggled to combat the determined Romanian double-winners.  Terry and Alex were unusually shaky at the back while Mikel John Obi was less than commanding in midfield.  &amp;amp;quot;The result is okay given we didn&amp;#039;t play well,&amp;amp;quot; said Scolari, who remains unbeaten as Chelsea manager.  &amp;amp;quot;It was difficult for us. The players and I know that a point is okay. They (Cluj) beat Roma, they are confident, they&amp;#039;re playing at home, they wanted to show to the people they are very good.  &amp;amp;quot;We knew this and we prepared but we missed one or two times in front of goal. Nil-nil is not a bad result today.&amp;amp;quot;      ESPNsoccernet
