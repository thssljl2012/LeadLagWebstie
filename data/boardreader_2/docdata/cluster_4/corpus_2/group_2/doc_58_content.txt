 Yeah Ronaldo&amp;#039;s dive was pathetic, but not as pathetic as the standing ovation he got at Old Trafford, in the match against Villareal...    As for the game against Chelsea I thought a point was a fair result, but I couldn&amp;#039;t help thinking that was a game in which United could have gone for the jugular and broke the home record of Chelsea. Given United were going to Chelsea on the back of a battering at Anfield and a blank at home against Villareal whilst also considering how well Chelsea were playing, leading up to the game, the result could be looked on as a great point. Despite this, to go to Stamford Bridge and create a lot of clear openings, and be pegged back by a set-piece because of poor marking, is a little dissapointing.  Oh and as for Mikel the words &amp;#039;last laugh&amp;#039; come to mind, especially if the money Chelsea paid United for him went toward Anderson&amp;#039;s transfer to United...
