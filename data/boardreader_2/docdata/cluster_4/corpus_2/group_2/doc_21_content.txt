     quote  DjedwardSmith    Way to dodge the fact that I showed your snide comment to be incorrect.  What was that? Its a fast moving thread. Hard to keep up!    Football is a game of opinion, and unfortunattly everyone gets one, so people who have no clue will be saying Liverpool are going to win the league. But the same applies to Arsenal fans!! And so many others. For you to judge all Liverpool fans off a few &amp;quot;kids&amp;quot; on this website is ludicris.
