   quote   g_lfc       quote  Sam    If that is the case then the offence is a yellow card one meaning he should still have to serve the ban seeing as red cards can&amp;#039;t be downgraded, correct me if I&amp;#039;m wrong.  I believe your right Sam!! So its a shocking decision to take away the red card, because whilst it was never a red card, it is a yellow! Surely he cant get away with getting no card for that!!  Then again it is Chelsea!       Coming from a scouse supporter...  He wasn&amp;#039;t the last man. Watch the replay, Carvalho was coming in. Carvalho also has some pace so he would&amp;#039;ve caught Jo. I doubt Jo would&amp;#039;ve of scored anyways    If it wasn&amp;#039;t a harsh sending off, it wouldn&amp;#039;t have been overturned.
