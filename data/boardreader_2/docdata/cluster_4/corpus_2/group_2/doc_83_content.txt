Hey, I still think he&amp;#039;s a good serviceable player.. its the fact that he&amp;#039;s turned in 4 shocking performances in the first four games that annoys me. Give him a spell on the sidelines rather than try to play him into some form, especially since he&amp;#039;s a defender. The other annoying thing about it was Baines getting dropped after being our MotM against Pompey... all because he wanted to slide Jagielka back into defence.
