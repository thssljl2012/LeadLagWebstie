   quote   vezsreds     Where are all these Liverpool fans who keep saying we&amp;#039;ll win the title and surely these fans are doing the same as you guys by assuming the extreme of one thing (keane) after only 7 games, if you&amp;#039;ve got the right to call someone a flop until he proves he isn&amp;#039;t then they have a right to say we will win the league until we&amp;#039;ve proven we don&amp;#039;t have a chance.   No, these are the fans who said that purely because of the signings, they&amp;#039;ll win the league. They were saying it before today and they&amp;#039;ll be saying it until it&amp;#039;s mathematically impossible. Not  may . But  will  win it.  There&amp;#039;s a huge difference. Keane hasn&amp;#039;t proven that he can live up to his price tag  YET.  Liverpool haven&amp;#039;t proven that they can live up to their own hype. Yet. So, same boat. Same situation.    quote   g_lfc     My point was that I had spoken to more Liverpool fans on the situation than you    And yet that doesn&amp;#039;t discount the fact that the ones I&amp;#039;ve spoken too, thus, the only way I&amp;#039;ll have been able to actually form my opinion, have said otherwise.    quote  Coming from an Arsenal fan thats rich!  Care to show me one comment where I&amp;#039;ve said that &amp;#039;OMG WE SIGNED A NEW PLAYER WE WILL WIN THE LEAGUE AND THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THIS YEAR IS OUR YEAR OMG WE HAVE FABREGAS&amp;#039;?    quote   matias f      And you&amp;#039;re privy to the inner workings of Benitez&amp;#039;s mind are you? The reason why he cost 20 m is because Tottenham wouldn&amp;#039;t sell him for less. Benitez is not going to spend that much on a player just so he will click with the side right away. Come back in February with a more intelligent view of Keane and his &amp;#039;floppishness&amp;#039;     You completely missed the point. THE LIVERPOOL FANS I&amp;#039;VE SPOKEN TOO used that excuse when they paid over the odds for them. My original comment, and subsequent ones, have been in reference to them, and their reasons for the price tag of his transfer. It&amp;#039;s funny how you try to question my intelligence, and yet time after time you&amp;#039;ve struggled to comprehend the simple English before your very eyes.  Ahhh, this is more like it.
