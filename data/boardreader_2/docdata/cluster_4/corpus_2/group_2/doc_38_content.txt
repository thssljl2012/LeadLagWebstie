   quote   Andy_Jay1987     Tottenham boss Juande Ramos says Dimitar Berbatov&amp;#039;s last-gasp move to Manchester United was their biggest blow as it left them no time to sign a replacement. (Daily Mirror)     Him and his stupid Manuel from Fawlty Towers accent can *bleep* off back to seville for all I care. And take Commoli and Levy with you dick.  Bring back Alan Sugar and Martin Jol.    Fans like you really *bleep*ing get on my nerves, seriously.     quote   Andy_Jay1987     i think the stupid thing is that Pav is the replacement, so he is talking shite for the fun of it.  That press conference was just pathetic. He can only speak English when the heat is on, what a twat.   Lets get Curbishley in.    He has spoken English for ages now, he just doesn&amp;#039;t *bleep* around with all the media, I don&amp;#039;t blame him for doing that.
