   quote   Irish Gamer     You know Spuds are in trouble when they&amp;#039;re calling for Alan Sugar     Wilkins replaces Clarke.   Still really gutted Clarke has left tbh     I&amp;#039;m gutted as well, i don&amp;#039;t see how going to West Ham is furthering his career. Anyway, at least we&amp;#039;ve got an assistant coach in who will get instant respect from the players, seems to know his football and of course most older Chelsea fans will know him from his playing days at Chelsea  .
