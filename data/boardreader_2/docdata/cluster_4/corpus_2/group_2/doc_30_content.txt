   quote   DjedwardSmith           quote   matias f      And you&amp;#039;re privy to the inner workings of Benitez&amp;#039;s mind are you? The reason why he cost 20 m is because Tottenham wouldn&amp;#039;t sell him for less. Benitez is not going to spend that much on a player just so he will click with the side right away. Come back in February with a more intelligent view of Keane and his &amp;#039;floppishness&amp;#039;     You completely missed the point. THE LIVERPOOL FANS I&amp;#039;VE SPOKEN TOO used that excuse when they paid over the odds for them. My original comment, and subsequent ones, have been in reference to them, and their reasons for the price tag of his transfer. It&amp;#039;s funny how you try to question my intelligence, and yet time after time you&amp;#039;ve struggled to comprehend the simple English before your very eyes.     There is nothing in your previous posts to say that it was not your opinion.      quote  Because the reason why he cost them 20 million was because he was meant to just slot right in.  He hasn&amp;#039;t, and thus he hasn&amp;#039;t done what he was bought for.   Yeah you made it real clear!
