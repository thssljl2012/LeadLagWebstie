         Aston Villa v Sunderland: Preview      Aston Villa manager Martin O&amp;#039;Neill is expected to revert to his first-choice team for the home Barclays Premier league clash with Sunderland.  O&amp;#039;Neill has fielded the same starting XI for all five league games so far, which means the likes of Brad Friedel, Luke Young, Curtis Davies, Martin Laursen, Nigel Reo-Coker and Gabriel Agbonlahor are set for recalls.  They were all left out of the side that suffered a shock Carling Cup reversal at the hands of QPR at Villa Park in midweek.  O&amp;#039;Neill has no fresh injury worries and midfielder Steve Sidwell could return to training next week after calf and knee problems, which have hampered him since his 5.5million summer move from Chelsea.  O&amp;#039;Neill believes &amp;amp;quot;the sky is the limit&amp;#039;&amp;#039; for Sunderland counterpart Roy Keane in terms of what he can achieve in management.  O&amp;#039;Neill, who has transformed his club&amp;#039;s fortunes in the past two years, can see the winning mentality Keane has brought to his team.  &amp;amp;quot;I think Roy Keane can be anything he wants to be. There is no question he was one of the great players of the last 10 to 15 years and acknowledged by everyone as being one of the top five Premier League players in the last decade,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said O&amp;#039;Neill.  &amp;amp;quot;He has gone in at Sunderland, when they were at the bottom of the Championship. He had no managerial experience whatsoever, but stepped in and took to the job immediately.  &amp;amp;quot;Obviously he has had a very supportive board right from the start, which is always good news, and I would imagine the vast majority of supporters are right behind him and acknowledge the job he has done.  &amp;amp;quot;I think he can definitely take Sunderland onto the level at which he would be at least satisfied with for the time being.  &amp;amp;quot;If he has the same drive and ambition as he had as a player, and why shouldn&amp;#039;t he, then the sky is the limit for him.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Keane will be without defender Nyron Nosworthy after he pulled a hamstring in the Carling Cup win over Northampton in midweek.  Grant Leadbitter broke his nose and suffered concussion in the same game and is also out but George McCartney is available after missing the tie because he had already played in the competition for West Ham.  Keane has insisted he will continue to speak his mind no matter who he upsets.  The Sunderland boss freely admitted he has talked himself into trouble throughout his career and is likely to do so again as he attempts to achieve as much in management as he did as a player.  But he is making no apologies for telling it how he sees it after he criticised both his players and some of his club&amp;#039;s fans in the wake of Tuesday night&amp;#039;s Carling Cup escape against Northampton.  Keane, whose side travel to Aston Villa in the Barclays Premier League tomorrow, said: &amp;amp;quot;I didn&amp;#039;t come to this club to be liked or to be popular. I have come here to do a job.  &amp;amp;quot;Three years, when I came here, was the mission and we are on course.  &amp;amp;quot;If I have to stir the players up or stir the supporters up, then I will do it.  &amp;amp;quot;I have done it before. I am involved in sport, and particularly football, because I love it. I love the game and I love winning.  &amp;amp;quot;If I have to get people out of their comfort zones, then I am quite happy to do that.  &amp;amp;quot;I have done it before. I have done it and it has cost me a lot in my career, and it probably will in the future.  &amp;amp;quot;I look back and a lot of my troubles in my career have not been what I have done, but what I have said.  &amp;amp;quot;I upset people, but a lot of people upset me. I never talk about that, though.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      ESPNsoccernet
