   quote   The Realest       quote   Chelsea Boi       I know.  It&amp;#039;s good to be confident, but to be thinking you&amp;#039;ve won the premiership already is a bit extreme.     Weren&amp;#039;t you the one saying that your ultra confident that Chelsea have the league wrapped up already and it will be over by March?        Because we&amp;#039;ve playing brilliant football. So has Arsenal. I never said we would win it, I just said I reckon.  Your a dick. Man Utd fans have also been saying they&amp;#039;re win it too.  So, it&amp;#039;s not just Chelsea fans.
