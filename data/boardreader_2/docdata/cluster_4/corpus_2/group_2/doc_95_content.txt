It is most likely a hamstring strain, and hopefully he will be back for our next game against Man Utd although he will miss the Spain internationals.  I doubt he pulled his hamstring anyway, otherwise he would not have walked off.     it&amp;#039;s true, awful game btw. We need torress for Man Utd.
