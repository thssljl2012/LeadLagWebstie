   quote   Johnny Boi     Yeah Ronaldo&amp;#039;s dive was pathetic,  but not as pathetic as the standing ovation he got at Old Trafford , in the match against Villareal...     I&amp;#039;ve always thought you were a good United fan with sound opinions, but the bolded part has made my respect for you increase tenfold. I couldn&amp;#039;t believe the ovation he got.  I think Mikel will be good enough, he&amp;#039;s been great the past few weeks, his passing was really poor on Sunday though.
