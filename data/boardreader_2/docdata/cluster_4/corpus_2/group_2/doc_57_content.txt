   Well if it was so bad, then why the *bleep* would they overturn it?  Wasn&amp;#039;t best of challenge but Carvalho was in front of Jo. Watch the replay and you&amp;#039;ll see.  Danny Guthrie should get a 7 game ban in my opinion. What the hell was he thinking. He can&amp;#039;t do that, and he&amp;#039;s broken Fagan&amp;#039;s leg.  New Joey Barton, anyone?
