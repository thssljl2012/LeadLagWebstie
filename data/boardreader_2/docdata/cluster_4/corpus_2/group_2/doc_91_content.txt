Grant steered his side back into contention during an outstanding April as they collected 10 points from a possible 12.      They rounded off the month with a crucial 2-1 win over Manchester United and they now go into the final round of games this weekend level on points with their rivals.      Chelsea host Bolton while United, who have a superior goal difference, travel to Wigan.      The Blues&amp;#039; only slip-up in April - which could still prove costly, given the goal difference - was the concession of a late equaliser to Wigan.      It is Grant&amp;#039;s first such award in English football.
