   quote   The Realest      They say it every year!    So? What he said is right, every team they put out is going to be a strong one, they are trying to win all competitions (unlike some) which is quite nice to see from a big four team and not belittling the CC. He says the group of players they have are impressive and they have a lot of quality, again, he&amp;#039;s not wrong.
