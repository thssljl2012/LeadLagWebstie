 Surely the time has come for Liverpool to get Babel on the right and push Kuyt upfront in place of Keane....      Owens goal was all class. I really do think a big club will snatch him away from Newcastle.       Fulham missed alot of chances (Zamora missed alot of chances) and can feel a bit hard done by by the looks of things
