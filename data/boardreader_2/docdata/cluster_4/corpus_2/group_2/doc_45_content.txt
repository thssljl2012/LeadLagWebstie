  We all know that Pennant&amp;#039;s a wanker but let&amp;#039;s face it, he&amp;#039;s what your missing on the right wing and Benitez is not even trying to bring one in the first place.  Pennant is a way better crosser and shooter then Kuyt. He also has a better foot for shots and handling the ball. Pennant can also tackle a bit. Kuyt? He can pass slightly better, but I do give him credit for being an excellent worker and team player but that happens in big games only (mostly) and you need a quality winger that will show his worth in every game and that player is - Jermaine Pennant.  Plus, he&amp;#039;s English.
