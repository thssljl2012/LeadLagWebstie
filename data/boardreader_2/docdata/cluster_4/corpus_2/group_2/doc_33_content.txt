 I just hope Ferguson doesn&amp;#039;t lose his head to not play Ronaldo. We&amp;#039;ll really need him. Although I really want us to win I think we&amp;#039;ll either draw 2-2 or lose 1-0. Unless we play some fantastic football and win, although I can see some signs of determination and ambition in our players especially players like Ronaldo, Evra and Rooney. Also I hope this time Berbatov runs in the pitch!
