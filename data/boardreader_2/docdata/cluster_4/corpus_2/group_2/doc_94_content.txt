         West Brom v West Ham: Preview      West Brom have an injury doubt over right-back Gianni Zuiverloon for Saturday&amp;#039;s clash against West Ham at The Hawthorns.  Zuiverloon damaged his hamstring playing for the Dutch under-21s against Switzerland on Tuesday and Belgian international Carl Hoefkens is on alert to replace him.  Central defender Abdoulaye Meite, who suffered a calf strain in Albion&amp;#039;s previous match against his former club Bolton, is expected to be fit.  Midfielder James Morrison, who missed Scotland&amp;#039;s World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Iceland, is available after recovering from a knee injury.  Central defenders Ryan Donk, who joined the Baggies on loan from AZ Alkmaar last month, and Jonas Olsson, who cost 800,000 from NEC Nijmegen, are both hoping to make their debuts.  West Brom manager Tony Mowbray has hailed his relationship with chairman Jeremy Peace and revealed he does not expect to ever find himself in the position which sparked Alan Curbishley&amp;#039;s departure from West Ham.  Curbishley was unhappy decisions were taken above his head to buy and sell players.  With Kevin Keegan quitting Newcastle in similar circumstances it has brought the relationship between chairman and manager into the spotlight.  However, Mowbray has no such worries about boardroom interference.  &amp;amp;quot;I do not envisage the time when my chairman will buy a player without my knowledge,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.  &amp;amp;quot;When clubs bring in players above a manager&amp;#039;s head that is a breakdown in communication. I would suggest that someone is not getting their point of view across.  &amp;amp;quot;I would not put ultimatums at my chairman&amp;#039;s door but that would not happen at Albion because I would like to think at this moment in our evolution as a partnership it has not got to that point.  &amp;amp;quot;There have been times when we have brought in people when it has not worked out but there have been times when, for very little money, we have found a little diamond who has done well.  &amp;amp;quot;Some things will get right up your nose and you make a stand. But do you make a stand to the point where you lose your job over it?  &amp;amp;quot;As a manager I have never been pushed to the point where I have had that dilemma because the people above me are managing me quite well.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  New signings Walter Lopez, David Di Michele and Herita Ilunga are included in West Ham&amp;#039;s squad for tomorrow&amp;#039;s trip to West Brom.  Midfielder Matthew Etherington has overcome illness and could feature in the Barclays Premier League clash.  Defender James Tomkins is also back in contention after recovering from his leg injury.  Gianfranco Zola has reassured West Ham&amp;#039;s players his lack of experience will not prevent him from being a success at Upton Park.  Zola was idolised during a seven-year spell at Chelsea that saw him score 80 goals in 312 matches and is remembered fondly throughout the Barclays Premier League.  The 42-year-old&amp;#039;s managerial CV is far less authoritative, however, and features a solitary spell with Italy&amp;#039;s Under-21s, the post he left for West Ham.  But Zola insists his approach to coaching at Upton Park will be shaped by his exploits during two decades in the game.  &amp;amp;quot;I know I am not the most experienced manager around but I have ideas - I have been in football for 20 years,&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.  &amp;amp;quot;I know what we&amp;#039;re talking about and I will certainly give something to this  club - whether it is enough or not we will see.  &amp;amp;quot;But I have a lot of knowledge of the game and the players will help me with  this.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Zola&amp;#039;s appointment on a three-year contract has excited Hammers fans mindful of his attacking genius as a player.  But the Upton Park board, who have operated a summer-long cost-cutting drive, have been accused of taking the cheap option in overlooking the more established names they interviewed.  &amp;amp;quot;I agree the lack of experience is a question mark and there were people on the shortlist who had more experience,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said chief executive Scott Duxbury.  &amp;amp;quot;But meeting him and talking to him at length about his football philosophy, it became clear there was no other choice.  &amp;amp;quot;It wasn&amp;#039;t about a taking a cheap option, he was the perfect option. His interview was so impressive that it was clear who we needed.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       ESPNsoccernet
