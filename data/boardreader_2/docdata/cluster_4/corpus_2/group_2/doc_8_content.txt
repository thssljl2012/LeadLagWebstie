         Scolari to consult board about Terry appeal      Luiz Felipe Scolari will speak to the Chelsea hierarchy before deciding whether to appeal against the red card that threatens to keep John Terry out of next Sunday&amp;#039;s showdown with Manchester United.   The England captain was dismissed 13 minutes from the end of Chelsea&amp;#039;s 3-1 Barclays Premier League win at Manchester City tonight after bringing down Jo just inside the visitors&amp;#039; half.  Referee Mark Halsey ruled Terry was the last man, even though Ricardo Carvalho was clearly behind his central defensive partner when the incident took place.  Scolari felt it was too early to say whether he will ask for Halsey to look at the incident again, although he intends to speak to club officials for their view.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;I would need to see it again on TV before I could really speak about it,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said the former Portugal national coach.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;I let the referee make decisions but I will speak to the players and the board because I don&amp;#039;t have any idea what happened.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Scolari was understandably delighted with the victory, especially as things looked bleak for Chelsea when Robinho curled City into a 13th-minute lead.  Considering Scolari wanted to sign the Brazilian himself before City stepped in with their British record 32.5million deadline-day bid, he could be forgiven for feeling slightly frustrated.  Instead, the Chelsea coach has nothing but good wishes for the 24-year-old.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;I have wished him all the best at Manchester City because I like him and he is my friend,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Scolari, who greeted Robinho with a huge embrace when the pair met immediately before kick-off.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;He scored once and we got three, so I am happy with that. Hopefully it will be the same next time we play City and I will be happy again.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Meanwhile, Scolari confirmed influential midfielder Michael Ballack will return from a foot injury when the Blues open their Champions League campaign against Bordeaux on Tuesday.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;He will play on Tuesday but I do not know whether it will be for 45 minutes, 60 or 70,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;The problem is they all want to play all the time because they have so much confidence.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      ESPNsoccernet
