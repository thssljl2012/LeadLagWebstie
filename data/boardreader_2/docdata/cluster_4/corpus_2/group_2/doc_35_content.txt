 Where are all these Liverpool fans who keep saying we&amp;#039;ll win the title and surely these fans are doing the same as you guys by assuming the extreme of one thing (Keane and us winning the title) after only 7 games, if you&amp;#039;ve got the right to call someone a flop until he proves he isn&amp;#039;t then they have a right to say we will win the league until we&amp;#039;ve proven we don&amp;#039;t have a chance.
