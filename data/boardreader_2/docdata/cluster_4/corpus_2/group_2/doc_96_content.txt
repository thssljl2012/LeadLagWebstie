Jermaine Pennant and David Ngog are both included in the starting XI as Gary Ablett names a strong reserve side for tonight&amp;#039;s Barclays Premier reserve League North clash in Sunderland - a match you can watch live on LFC TV.     The Reds&amp;#039; second-string got the defence of their title off to an impressive start with a 1-0 win at Middlesbrough a fortnight ago and they will be hoping for a similar return from their latest trip to the North-east where they will face Sunderland at the Eppleton Colliery Welfare ground in Hetton le Hole tonight.         The match kicks off at 7pm BST but you can enjoy all the pre-match build-up from 6.15pm where presenter Matt Critchley will be joined in the studio by John Durnin and David Johnson while Reds legend David Fairclough will form part of our commentary team in the north-east to help guide you through the full 90 minutes of action.         The Liverpool team in full:         Dean Bouzanis    Stephen Darby (Captain)    Emiliano Insua    Mikel San Jose Dominguez    Ronald Huth    Damien Plessis    Jermaine Pennant    Jay Spearing    David Ngog    Daniel Pacheco    Nabil El Zhar         Substitutes:    Gerardo Bruna    Peter Gulacsi    Ryan Flynn    Jordy Brouwer    Martin Kelly
