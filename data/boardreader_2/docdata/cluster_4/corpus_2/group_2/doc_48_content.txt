   quote   Chelsea Boi       To be honest, a yellow card would&amp;#039;ve been fair.      Exactly, you can&amp;#039;t downgrade from red to yellow. It should be a card or nothing, considering it was already a red card if it deserves to be a yellow the ban should still stand.  Also &amp;quot;Why was it overturned if it deserved to be upheld?&amp;quot; LOL! He&amp;#039;s England captain that&amp;#039;s why, he&amp;#039;s allowed to do whatever the *bleep* he wants!
