         Keegan On The Brink      Sky Sports News understands Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan has left his position at St James&amp;#039; Park.   Keegan returned for his second stint as Magpies boss in January, but rumours suggest he could be leaving his role.  Sky Sports News understands Keegan did not take training on Tuesday and met with board members on Monday.  Speculation is claiming that Keegan has been unhappy with the club&amp;#039;s transfer dealings during the summer and is ready to leave St James&amp;#039; Park.  The Magpies have made several signings in recent weeks, but doubts have persisted over Keegan&amp;#039;s future at the helm.  Since replacing Sam Allardyce at the start of this year, Keegan has won six of his 21 games in charge.  Despite Saturday&amp;#039;s 3-0 defeat at Arsenal, Newcastle had made a bright start to the new campaign, following up a draw at champions Manchester United by beating Bolton Wanderers at home.  Newcastle also set up a Carling Cup third round meeting with holders Tottenham following last week&amp;#039;s 3-2 extra-time win at Coventry City.
