Pity it doesn&amp;#039;t apply to some. Man Utd&amp;#039;s conduct was very, very poor.    Chelsea probably should have won it.                      One team was trying to win that match.      The other was playing like Stoke.      Well done Manchester United.      That central midfield of Fletcher and Hargreaves is bottom half quality. No ambition and they&amp;#039;re both very average, very limited footballers.      That being said Ballack and Lampard were both abysmal and Scholes wasn&amp;#039;t any better.      Man of the match by a mile was Mikel. He did everything. He&amp;#039;s a machine. Didn&amp;#039;t give the ball away once, the only central midfielder to play well, played sensibly, was excellent defensively and he&amp;#039;s just brilliant. He&amp;#039;s really starting to dominate now.      Ballack, Lampard and Deco are going to have to sort out who isn&amp;#039;t playing between them because Mikel aint playing that game. He&amp;#039;s too good for them.      FC would&amp;#039;ve loved the big black man outshining the five white men in central midfield.
