 Seems its running since March, Im guessing he didnt like being called English     http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CF...cgi?ID=1029177     SUNDERLAND, England (AP) &amp;amp;#8211; Sunderland boss Roy Keane has been warned not to try to stop Carlos Edwards and Kenwyne Jones playing for Trinidad and Tobago in a few weeks.    He questioned the selection of Edwards for a friendly in Jamaica on March 27, with the winger having been out of action with a broken leg since December.    Edwards is close to a returning, with the midweek reserve game against Manchester United being lined up for his comeback, but Keane feels he should not be made to travel for his country&amp;amp;#8217;s friendly.    &amp;amp;#8220;I&amp;amp;#8217;m surprised Carlos has been called up,&amp;amp;#8221; Keane said.    &amp;amp;#8220;He&amp;amp;#8217;s played one, two games in the last seven, eight, nine months. Maybe I need to make a call to their manager. Maybe they&amp;amp;#8217;re not aware of that.&amp;amp;#8221;    Trinidad and Tobago&amp;amp;#8217;s friendly in Kingston also falls just two days before Sunderland&amp;amp;#8217;s crucial Barclays Premier League home clash with West Ham.    Keane also would be reluctant to release star striker Jones, saying: &amp;amp;#8220;We&amp;amp;#8217;ll cross that bridge when we get to it.&amp;amp;#8221;    But FIFA vice&amp;amp;#8211;president and Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation special advisor Jack Warner said: &amp;amp;#8220;Maybe Keane needs to be reminded of the FIFA rules on matters like this one.    &amp;amp;#8220;Had it been an African country, of any size, he would not even have contemplated any battle of any kind.    &amp;amp;#8220;It tells you of the contempt a few English coaches continue to have for the countries in the Caribbean, especially a country like Trinidad and Tobago.    &amp;amp;#8220;Like Keane, Trinidad and Tobago will no doubt cross the Edwards bridge when it comes to it.&amp;amp;#8221;    Edwards has yet to play for the Trinis under new head coach Francisco Maturana and the Colombian is keen to have both the former Luton star and Jones in the fold ahead of his side&amp;amp;#8217;s World Cup qualifiers.    &amp;amp;#8220;It is important that we have these players involved in some form in the preparations from as early as possible,&amp;amp;#8221; Maturana said.    &amp;amp;#8220;The game against Jamaica is important which is why we have to also have a player like Kenwyne Jones involved.&amp;amp;#8221;
