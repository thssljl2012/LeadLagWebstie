Fulham missed alot of chances (Zamora missed alot of chances) and can feel a bit hard done by by the looks of things                      Keane had another couple of good chances today.     He was kicking the thing today. Even making good contact.    He had the kick it straight into the goalkeepers breadbasket with the rest of the goals to aim at radar on today.    Liverpool fans are already missing Voronin.
