 Whether or not Vidic deserved a red or not is irrelevant, as you cannot upgrade a yellow to a red. Under the rules of the game, he should have been sent off if the referee had deemed it a goalscoring opportunity. He judged it to be a yellow, and so the decision cannot be changed.  Terry&amp;#039;s foul was beyond sticking out a leg, and clearly an intentional foul. Carvalho may well have been covering Jo, but not the auxiliary runner. A yellow may well have been shown by another referee, but we can&amp;#039;t go now inspecting all refereeing decision where the card shown was subjective to which referee was in charge.  I am disappointed the ban has been rescinded, and further proof of favouritism for the conspiracists.
