C.Ronaldo will not be sold to Man City because Man U will not allow, the fans would kill him, and C.Ronaldo wants to go to a prestigious club like the Galacticos(Madrid). He is a great player and nobody can argue it. of course he has his falts like diving, But he still is great. You can argue that their are other players who deserve to be labeled as the best in world and it may be true, but if you&amp;#039;ve watched Ronaldo last year then you know why he is considered the best at the moment. Dont get me wrong those players you listed are great too(except Crespo) but compared to what C.Ronaldo did last year is no contest(maybe Messi). keep in mind that when players do win the title as Worlds best player, they are voted by national team managers and, team captains. We will have to see if he whens that award later this year, But he is/was the best in Europe.       And i&amp;#039;m not a fanboy of C.Ronaldo. I actually hate him, but I do admit hes good. I&amp;#039;m a Liverpool fan forever, and I don&amp;#039;t even consider Torres at C.Ronaldo&amp;#039;s level. I myself consider Gerrard the greatest player in the world, because of everything he did/does for Liverpool.      And if Man City buy Ronaldo(Brazilian one), its just going to end bad for them. he&amp;#039;s 31 and is injury prone now. He was good, but if he can stay healthy he would be good as an experienced 2nd stringer. Some one who can help the young lads get better.                      i never did say that ronaldo wasn&amp;#039;t good...i know he&amp;#039;s good. but i believe that there are much better players than him. what part of crespo isn&amp;#039;t good? i believe he&amp;#039;s an excellent striker and has definitely shown his worth time after time in serie a.      i&amp;#039;m personally a chelsea fan and always have been...i think man city won&amp;#039;t benefit at all. chelsea picked up shevchenko and ballack at the same time and neither of them really got their foot. shevchenko was plain garbage and ballack is just getting his groove. now shev is back with ac milan....where i believe he belongs. ronaldinho is now with ac milan and he&amp;#039;s not doing too well from what i&amp;#039;ve seen      but i dunno...i all know is i hate c ronaldo...lol
