   quote   DjedwardSmith     You always get those kind of people though. Liverpool have them, Chelsea have them, United have them, Tottenham have them, and Newcastle has a shit load of them.     I know.  It&amp;#039;s good to be confident, but to be thinking you&amp;#039;ve won the premiership already is a bit extreme.
