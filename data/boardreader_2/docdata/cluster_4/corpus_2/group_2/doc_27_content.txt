   quote   Will     I haven&amp;#039;t been down to check, but it would be something like  Extreme Makeover: Home Edition . He only watches football if he can go to a bar and drink, but he&amp;#039;s hungover from last night, so he&amp;#039;s just chilling.   ...Does that not worry you?    Good day of sport today, Chelsea v Man Utd then the Ryder Cup singles. Can&amp;#039;t miss out on it.
