  Hiya guys, have i misread the ad and all the hype for the Barclays reserve???     i thought that this was the new way of helping its customers thats if you actually are given the new reserve account amount, i havent neither has my husband, as we have not had any letters,     so after my query with them, they told me no i havent been offered it and i will have to apply if i wish and the amount would only be for 150.00 if i get it,      i declined it as i think its going to be okay for some customers but i think i will be better off to be in the black without any overdraft to rely on. So im making my next quest to rid us of our overdraft just keep it on for emergencies. Guess thats what it was intended for but as life keeps kicking , it was like forever being used.     So fellow people, i urge you to relook at your own finances and if you can do all you can to pay any overdraft back, because i really think this reserve may not be the wonderful thing its being broadcast to be.      Barclays after 15 years being a customer, declined my temporary ov/draft for 2 weeks overdraft of an increase of 400.00 today, so now ive reassed my finances, if you cant help a customer like me on a temporary position, you wont help me if i ever got into really dire problems.      Im going to move our bills account which has no overdraft position to the co op get ourselves a 100.00 bonus, claim our bank charges on 2 accounts let them sit in the queue at the court and then move my 2nd account out in the future.     Another customer unhappy and will be moving my accounts pronto.     They declare to be helpful towards their customers but i didnt get that help today so am taking my business elsewhere.      Good luck to all, have a good day ciao for now     MAZ     ps am aiming to have self reliance from now on, today has proved more than ever what Martin always tells us - Loyalty does NOT PAY.!
