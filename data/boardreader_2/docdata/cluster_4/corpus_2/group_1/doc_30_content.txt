  Barclays has been going on about the Personal Reserve being beneficial for the customer. I think Barclays is trying to hoodwink its customers. The APR on authorised overdrafts has increased by about 2&amp;amp;#37; and standard current account holders will no longer receive that 0.1% monthly interest if they are in credit. If you want any interest on your credit balances, you&amp;#039;ll have to get one of the fee-paying current accounts they&amp;#039;ve been trying to flog to their customers for ages. Or take your business elsewhere.
