  Reading this thread it would seem the whole ID verification thing is one of the themes.  This happened to my partner and myself on last years Tax Beater ISA.  Both opened our accounts separately at different branches with all the necessary ID (in actual fact we both took in more ID than actually required) YET we were both later recalled to the individual branches due problem verifying our ID.  Off we go to our individual branches only to be told that our ID was in actual fact fine???      This was just one of a long catalogue of errors Barclays made opening both of our accounts (to numerous to list) - I can only conclude that the ISA back office is not at all organised.      Once bitten, twice shy - I will in future avoid Barclays as it wasn&amp;#039;t worth the hassle.
