  Hi WBF     Yes, it would be best to tell them and get the new account sorted. They&amp;#039;ll almost certainly downgrade your account to the cash card one.  I went with Barclays (although i didn&amp;#039;t owe them anything) and they&amp;#039;ve been fab.   I know other Brs have owed Barclays and have still been offered a cash card account with them.
