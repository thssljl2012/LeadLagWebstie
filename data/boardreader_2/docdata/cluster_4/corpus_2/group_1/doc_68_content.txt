  It is your own bank&amp;#039;s responsibility to make enquiries about your ATM withdrawal after they have a written statement of the facts from you.  Have you done this?  Normally this would take 2-3 weeks before a reply is received from Barclays.     Again normally if they have replied they normally put a paragraph in their letter saying if you are unhappy about the conclusion of the enquiry for you to contact them again by letter. Has this happened to you?     If Barclays say that the machine was not faulty and balanced then you will have to take your complaint further. I don&amp;#039;t suppose that you were interrupted by anyone whilst carrying out the transaction? - someone could have snatched the money when you weren&amp;#039;t looking?
