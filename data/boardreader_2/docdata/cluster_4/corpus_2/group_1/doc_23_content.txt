Yea out of the Barclays electron card and Halifax basic electron i would opt for the Halifax, basically the electron with Barclays requires you to have a normal current account but the card you can get with it will either be a normal debit or an electron, so first of all you have to apply for a normal current account which requires a credit check so its a useless card on a current account, but the basic cash card with Halifax is easily obtainable without worrying if you will pass the credit checks, if you are declined then you have serious problems because its not a credit account, the Halifax electron can be kept aside and used only when you need it like for the airline tickets      by the way i work for barclays not halifax but i do have a normal account with both banks and the cash card account with Halifax, it works well
