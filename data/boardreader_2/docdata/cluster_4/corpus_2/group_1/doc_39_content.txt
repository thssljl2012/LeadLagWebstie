I&amp;#039;m assuming you can&amp;#039;t split your yearly ISA allowance between 2 providers - yes?  And it is wrong to do that, what are the likely consequences?  Would appreciate any advice.                      Don&amp;#039;t know about splitting your allowance between two providers, presumably someone more knowledgeable will come along and answer that.      But I can tell you that I have now transferred my Barclays Tax Haven 08/09 ISA out to another provider.  I had put the full allowance in when I opened it and I fully expected NOT to have the bonus added when I transferred it but to my amazement and delight the bonus was added.  So if you are totally p&amp;#039;d off with Barclays you can transfer now without waiting until the end of the ISA year.  Just find a provider who will accept transfers in.
