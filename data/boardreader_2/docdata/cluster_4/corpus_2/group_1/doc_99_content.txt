  Barclays sent me 2 envolopes with 6 years worth of statements enclosed, did you request/recieve statements for the past 6 years, or just a summary of charges? request the 6 years worth of statements and then go through the statements yourself and highlight all the charges. i rang up to request mine, its quicker and easier.
