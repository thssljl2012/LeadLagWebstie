  I don&amp;#039;t see how the PINsentry works. It doesn&amp;#039;t communicate with the computer or internet, so how does the website know if you&amp;#039;ve put the same code in as on the PINsentry?    I can put any of my cards in: Co-op, Lloyds, A&amp;amp;amp;L and Barclays, they all give me a code. I confused about it all.
