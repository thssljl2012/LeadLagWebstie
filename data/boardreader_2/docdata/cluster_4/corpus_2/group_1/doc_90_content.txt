  No I do not work for Barclays Bank and I am far from defending them, you will see in my previous post that my complaint with them is with the Financial Ombudsmen Service.      Look at your case objectively, there are issues but once you have signed on the dotted line, rightly or wrongly so they are not going to go out of their way to be helpful - irrespective of how long ago you applied.
