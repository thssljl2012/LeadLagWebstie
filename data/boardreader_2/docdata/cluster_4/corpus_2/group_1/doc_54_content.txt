Barclays are saying that it therefore is a credit in the next day so even though I wasn&amp;#039;t overdrawn, as far as they are concerned I am because I was at 6.30.  I am so annoyed.  Just spoke to them on the phone and they are able to do nothing unless its bank error or fraud - or so they say.  I intend to write to them about it and if they don&amp;#039;t remove the charge I am moving my business elsewhere.      If I had left the account overdrawn then I wouldn&amp;#039;t be so annoyed but I didn&amp;#039;t - I sorted it out.  I have never heard of them using this &amp;#039;after 6.30&amp;#039; excuse before.  I haven&amp;#039;t had a charge in years and an absolutely livid.  Makes a complete mockery of internet banking            Very mad - Alliance and Leicester here I come....    SJ                      You wouldn&amp;#039;t have the issue if you didn&amp;#039;t run your account into the overdraft, past the overdraft or simply just close to zero.    At the end of the day it is not the banks fault people can&amp;#039;t budget correctly.    All people have to do is cut down of out-going expenses until they are several hundred pound or more in credit and keep it there.    Annoys me when people moan about the banks, when it is the customers fault really.    A&amp;amp;amp;L will treat you the same, in fact I know people who are just as angry with A&amp;amp;amp;L.  With A&amp;amp;amp;L and probably other banks you need to make sure money is in before 17:30.  With A&amp;amp;amp;L payments may be taken at 10:00 or 12:00 so if that takes you over-drawn then, you will be hit with a 25 fee, even if you paid in cash before 17:30 as you would already have hit the charges.
