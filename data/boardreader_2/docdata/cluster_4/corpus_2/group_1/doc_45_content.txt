  Here&amp;#039;s the long and short: I stick my non-Barclays ATM card into Barclays machine and, despite adequate funds in the account, get the card spat out four times. Home I go and, lo and behold, 200 has gone out of my account!    So... Barclays look into it and twice say the money will be refunded, but twice it isn&amp;#039;t. They then advise me to get my own bank to launch an &amp;amp;quot;indemnity claim&amp;amp;quot; against them. This comes back negative and is now on round two.    We are now six weeks, and by the time the second claim comes back, nine weeks down the line.    What can I do? The Ombudsman?    And, no, it isn&amp;#039;t a cloning or anything like that.
