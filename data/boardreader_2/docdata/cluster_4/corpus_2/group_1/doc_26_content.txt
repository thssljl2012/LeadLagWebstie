  The reason why they probably call it an &amp;amp;quot;electron&amp;amp;quot; is because it does have the same functionality embedded as the (old) electron; in that all transactions are forced by the software on the card to be authorised online so (in theory) you can&amp;#039;t get overdrawn on it.     They probably refer to it as the &amp;amp;quot;electron&amp;amp;quot; for familiarity. The Barclays &amp;amp;quot;Visa Electron&amp;amp;quot; doesn&amp;#039;t exist anymore as far as I am aware.     Certainly, I have seen that Barclays do 3 types of Connect debit card; an &amp;amp;quot;electron&amp;amp;quot; with no cheque guarantee, one with a 50 cheque guarantee and another with a 100 cheque guarantee. They are all Visa Debit, but have varying degrees of cheque guarantee, and for the upper levels, it is up to the software on the card and/merchant or bank to decide whether to authorise a transaction online or offline.
