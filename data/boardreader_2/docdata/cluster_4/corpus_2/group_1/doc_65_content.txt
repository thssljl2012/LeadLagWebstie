  Following online transactions on Saturday (yesterday), I&amp;#039;ve gone over my Barclays current account overdraft limit by about 300.  I can see this because the &amp;amp;quot;Current Cleared Balance&amp;amp;quot; on online banking is -3,300 whereas my overdraft is 3,000.  (However &amp;amp;quot;Last Night&amp;#039;s Balance&amp;amp;quot; is -2,000).    Can anyone help with the following:    1. The transactions which make up the Current Cleared Balance include direct debits dated 11/08/08 (tomorrow).  Even though they show on online banking as having gone out, could they still bounce?  2. What will I get charged?  It looks like it&amp;#039;s capped at 30 a day but I&amp;#039;m not sure.  3. Yesterday I tried to pay money into Barclays from a Lloyds account using Faster Payments however this hasn&amp;#039;t worked yet, even though they are supposed to go through quickly even on weekends.  Any thoughts on how else to minimise the charges?    Thanks
