  I have an current account at Barclays and have been sent a form to sign and return which sets out new charges and rules. It seems ok but I am automatically suspicious of being asked to sign anything like that. I have a claim in to reclaim my charges and I am worried that this is a way to get around refunding me if the courts agree that is what must happen. Has anybody got any advice about whether I am doing the right thing to just complete and return it?
