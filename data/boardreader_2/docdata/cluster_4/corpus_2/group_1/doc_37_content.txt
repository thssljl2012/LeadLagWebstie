  I have been helping my mother-in-law (with the help of this site) to decide where to save some money that she has. Anyway, yesterday she went to Barclays - which is where she has had her current account for years - to see if they had any accounts that would offer her a decent savings rate. We have chatted about this and I warned her that they almost certainly wouldn&amp;#039;t have as good a rate as other accounts we have been looking at but she wanted to set her mind at rest that this was the case so I thought that it was best for her to see for herself.      While she was there they tried to sell her an investment that supposedly &amp;#039;kept her money safe from being used if she ever needed nursing care because of the things (presumably shares even though she stipulated that she wasn&amp;#039;t interested in shares) it is invested in&amp;#039;. I am not very well at the moment so couldn&amp;#039;t go with her to the meeting and she wasn&amp;#039;t given any literature about this account so I have no idea what is was called and can&amp;#039;t find anything about in on the Barclays website. It was apparently a five-year investment/account, which was much longer term than she wanted anyway, and she would receive &amp;#039;bonuses&amp;#039; during the investment term and an added rate of interest as she already has a Barclays current account.     This smells like some sort of share portfolio to me but has anyone heard of this investment and is it possible to put money in some sort of investment that can&amp;#039;t be touched if you need nursing care? I just can&amp;#039;t believe that this is possible!     Any help and/or advice gratefully received.
