  My friends have come to me in desperation at a decision they have received from Barclays Bank following the fraudulent use of one of their debit cards. Their case is as follows.    Received their July bank statement and notice two transactions they did not make. Firstly in the morning a 200.00 cash withdrawn from a cashpoint at the local Asda supermarket. Followed by BP petrol station debit card deduction of around 45.00.    I told them to contact Barclays and the Police to report the fraudulent unauthorised use. When they reported the incidents to Barclays they were told not to involve the Police as Barclays would deal with the matter in house.    This week they received a letter from Barclays stating they will not be getting a refund. They visited Barclays and were told the chip used was the one in the husbands card. They have pointed out if the card was cloned then the chip details would appear to be the same. They also told Barclays at the time of the cashpoint withdrawal the husband was dropping off their daughter at nursery and at the time the petrol was purchased his wife had their car at work. The husband cycles to work. The member of staff at Barclays said they could appeal to the bank but they had no chance of winning as the &amp;amp;quot;chip&amp;amp;quot; issue meant the decision would not be reversed.    I am prepared to accept they are entirely innocent. They have 3 children all under 8 so none on the children could have used the husbands card.     How should i tell them to proceed from the initial refusal made by Barclays?     Many thanks.
