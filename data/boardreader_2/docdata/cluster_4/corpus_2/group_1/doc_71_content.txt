         Hi DW99   I phoned Barclays Premier Banking to report my suspicions, and request that payment of the cheque be refused. Their response was that their procedures cannot allow this. Instead they have to retrieve a copy of the cheque, mail it to me, and then I have to go into my local branch and prove that I still have the unissued cheque!!!&amp;amp;lt;i/&amp;amp;gt;   I&amp;#039;m going throught the process of getting copies of two cheques at the moment (Alliance &amp;amp;amp; Leicester). They were very surprised that I *didn&amp;#039;t* want the amounts refunded while they investigated (at least two months after the cheques were issued), so I&amp;#039;d go back to Barclays and query this.  Regards Ann
