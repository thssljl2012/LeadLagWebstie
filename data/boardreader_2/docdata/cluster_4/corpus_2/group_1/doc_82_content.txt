  If you have a Barclays account and don&amp;#039;t have the PIN sentry yet I would advise you attempt to do an online transfer so that they send out the PIN sentry. Better get it in advance of needing it than having to wait when you do.     I think they are an excellent idea. The main problem I have is logging in from work as I do not want to carry it around.
