  My wife knew she would be 2.78 overdrawn last wednesday so i went to the bank on tuesday and put in 90, i got to the bank at 3:10 stood in the queue and waited and waited eventually paying it in at 3:40, she has just got a letter saying she has been charged 22 for going into her reserve account, she phoned the bank and they said she went overdrawn because the money was late going in ??? I&amp;#039;ve also noticed barclays stamped the book for the day after, surely this can&amp;#039;t be right?
