  My gf just received a letter today saying as she was 5 overdrawn they have charged her 30 for the privilege.  Her account is just a basic Barclays account with a Visa Electron and no overdraft.  Is this the kind of situation where you can claim the money back?  Most of the info I&amp;#039;ve seen is relating to bank charges from years ago on overdrafts etc which is rather confusing.    If so, what do we do now? Pay the 30 fine then send off the letters and wait?    Thanks
