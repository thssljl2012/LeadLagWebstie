Hello,      My Barclays card was stolen last week with my wallet. My pin number is in my head since i&amp;amp;#039;ve had this number for ages. Thieves managed to withdraw some money from a cash machine thirty minutes later and the bank now refuses to reimburse the amount.   I know i did not leave my pin number anywhere and i intend to fight this. any advice ? I don&amp;amp;#039;t know how to seek help on this one.
