      It appears that the credit economy is coming to an end, or is it?  My slightly gullible and naive mum went into barclays last week to change the address of her account. She came out with a credit card and a premium bank account. she doesn&amp;#039;t have much money, has a bad credit history and is approaching retirement.  I&amp;#039;m currently trying to pursuade her to cancel both before her 14 days to change her mind expires. After a long chat it appears to be peer pressure that caused her to get the credit card. Her dum and gobby work friend had been ridiculing her debit card, saying &amp;amp;quot;that&amp;#039;s what students have&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;quot;  There are plenty of punters and salepeople still out there who are up for debt
