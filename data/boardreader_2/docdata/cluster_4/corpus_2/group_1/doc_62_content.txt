Sorry, I quoted badly. What I meant was the Barclays FAQ you quoted wasn&amp;#039;t relevant to the OP&amp;#039;s situation since the account was overdrawn the day before the wages hit, not the same day.     It doesn&amp;#039;t matter whether it was 1 minute or 23 hours 59 minutes, it was the (banking day) before.
