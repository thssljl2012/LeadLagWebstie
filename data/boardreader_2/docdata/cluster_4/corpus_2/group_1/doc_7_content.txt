The Argentine international will join City for 6.5m after agreeing a four-year deal with the club.      The former Espanyol player&amp;#039;s arrival could now trigger the departure of Vedran Corluka to Tottenham on a busy day for City manager Mark Hughes.      With Shaun Wright-Phillips&amp;#039; return to Eastlands to be runner-stamped at a press conference this afternoon, City&amp;#039;s squad is finally taking shape.       Zabaleta won gold in Beijing for Argentina, and City&amp;#039;s newly signed full-back is relishing the chance to play in the Premier League      23-year-old right-back Zabaleta told Sportsmail: &amp;#039;The offer of Manchester City is impossible to reject and not only because of the money.    &amp;#039;The Premier League is a paradise for players and that is why I want to play here.      &amp;#039;At Espanyol I am happy and always very grateful to club but these chances do not come along very often.    &amp;#039;I have known about the interest of Manchester City for some months buy my club have not wanted to negotiate.      &amp;#039;Juventus also wanted me but I wanted to come to England, and to City.      &amp;#039;In Beijing, City scouts watched the Argentina matches and decided to do the deal. There are many Argentinian players in England and that is positive because it shows the level of our football.      &amp;#039;I hope to fulfill all expectations that City have of me and to play UEFA Cup is also good news. It&amp;#039;s a great competition.&amp;#039;         Crisis,what Crisis???               I have nothing to declare but my genius!
