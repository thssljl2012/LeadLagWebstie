  I wonder how many people are having problems with the Barclays TAX HAVEN ISA.     In April this year I contacted Barclays to open the above Isa. I had to make an appointment at the branch to open it. I brought full ID which was checked and the account was submitted. (The terms stated that due to demand there was a delay, but interest would be applied 14 days after application).       The 3600 lay dormant in my current account. Over the next month I made repeated calls to customer service (Long waits for call to be answered) and kept being assured delays would not affect my interest. I informed them I would be away from June for one month.     Got back July and had letter stating account not opened due to insufficient documents provided at application.     More calls then appointment at Branch. Staff did not need any more documents but stated it was an IT fault where branch computers were not compatible with the HQ.     Details submitted again. Two weeks later same letter sent again as above stating insufficient details provided.     Several phoncalls again and complaint made. I was also informed account would be opened but interest owed would be in a cheque. NOT kept within the ISA wrapper.     I made formal complaint about delays in account opening/visits to branch. Time wasted on phoncalls that took ages to be answered and loss of Isa wrapper for interest earned.  I got a generic letter within the required 7 days, ignoring my complaint but apologising for delays in opening Tax Haven accounts.     Long phone calls again today. Was told I could wait up to 20 weeks for a response(This is not uncommon).     My questions are     1. Have other people had long delays in opening accounts  2. Had problems waiting a long time to get the call answerd by customer service/complaints  3 Had the interest earned during the delayed opening, paid outside the ISA  4 Are people still waiting for specific complaints to be properly answered after being sent a generic response to satisfy banking rules.        Is Barclays playing a clever game using generic letters to satisfy regulations  Is it always difficult to get a reply from customer service on the phones.
