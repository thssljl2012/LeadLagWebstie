  Thanks.      I also asked a friend to transfer some cash from a Nationwide account late last night, also hopefully using Faster Payments.  That hasn&amp;#039;t arrived.    Strangely my Barclays account still looks the same, no bounced direct debits.  &amp;amp;quot;Last Night&amp;#039;s Balance&amp;amp;quot; is still at -2,000 and Current Cleared Balance still at -3,300.    I&amp;#039;m off to the bank to deposit some cash pronto.
