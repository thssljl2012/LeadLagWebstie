  Thanks for that Nicky, but I want to open an ISA somewhere else asap.  I have no futher interest in Barclays even if they doubled the rate.  Don&amp;#039;t the FSA rules say that I have 14 days to cancel any finincial services product?  I just want to undo this asap.     Also not happy that Barclays advisor has carried out a credit check on me without telling me that he was doing so, (not a requirement for opening an ISA) surely this is also in breach of the FSA regs?  I checked with my online experian account and it shows this search.  I don&amp;#039;t bank with them and the advisor was trying to sell me other products ie current accounts/credit cards etc now I know why.     It just seems to me that Barclays want to make things as difficult as possible to change your mind, something I am well within my rights to do.
