You have every right to complain seeing as other banks would not bother charging you for the amount of money in debit-and especially when you had been stood in the queue to rectify the problem!                      What sales technique?    Firstly, this is not new! Banks have been charging these amounts for un-arranged overdrafts for a very long time. Secondly, other banks have and will continue to charge automatically for small amounts.    I don&amp;#039;t know about Barclays, but Natwest regurarly send me leaflets about T&amp;amp;amp;Cs updates and plain english leaflets about charges. You sign up and agree to pay these charges when you open your account.     I don&amp;#039;t agree with 22 for such a small amount, totally exccessive, but don&amp;#039;t start a hate campaign against the company for routine banking practices. This is what banks do - if you don&amp;#039;t like it, close your account! Or get an **arranged** overdraft!
