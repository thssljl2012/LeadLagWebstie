  I used to have an Electron card with Barclays, but they &amp;amp;quot;upgraded&amp;amp;quot; me to a Visa Debit last year. They must make a higher commision out of the merchants or something.    The Halifax easycash account was a doddle to open (although they accidentally opened two for me, but promptly fixed it). I received my Visa electron card about 4 days after signing up online, which was very impressive. It has saved me about 32 in this month alone      Thanks to everyone for the advice - it is great taking advantage of the 1 and 10 fares without getting stung on stupid card fees.
