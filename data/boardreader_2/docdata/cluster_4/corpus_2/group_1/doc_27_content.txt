  Chuckley and Heng Leng and all the others who replied THANKS, I applied over the phone today for a Visa Electron with CO-OP.     Now as for Barclays they must be desperate for custom, they told me in the bank YES you will get an electron but it wont say it on it.     Afetr a 30minute call to customer services they tried to UPGRADE MY account i said i just wanted a ELECTRON, They then told me Mr Black that is what you have, so i gave up and agreed. Funny how it doesnt say that on the card it says: VISA DEBIT AND CONNECT  Also starts with 4658 and has raised numbers.  Im so cancelling the Barclays account on Tuesday and even emailed them to say so.  Talk about &amp;amp;quot;Missleading Representation&amp;amp;quot;.
