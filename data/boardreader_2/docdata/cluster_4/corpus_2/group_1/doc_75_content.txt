  When i made my claim against Barclays last year i asked what my 11.50 &amp;#039;account fee&amp;#039; was. I was told it was for general handling of my account and included things such as car breakdown cover, mobile phone insurance and personal injury insurance.     I pointed out that i never asked for these as i have my own cover and why the hell would i be willing to pay twice for the same cover. They said i would have been informed of this when it all started. So i challenged them to provide me with strict proof that i was informed and that i signed and agreed to this.  Just a few weeks later they offered; as a gesture of good will 12 months repayment of 138.  I accepted this amount as i had also just reclaimed nearly 4000 in charges. the day the money hit my account i walked in, emptied my account and closed it.       May be something worth checking out still..............????????????
