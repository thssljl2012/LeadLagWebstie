    Im a money saving expert like the man in the corner without his gorgeous girlfriend.     I applied for a Visa Electron card from Barclays and was told by the Bank man that its the exact same though it no longer says Electron on it.     So i booked 2 adult return fares to Bournemouth for an amazing 40 return so i pulled out my special new Connect card and used the electron sign in Ryanair and it was declined 3 times.     So why is that ? The bank man said it was definatley a Electron     And now the flights cost 56 if i dont use it please help ??
