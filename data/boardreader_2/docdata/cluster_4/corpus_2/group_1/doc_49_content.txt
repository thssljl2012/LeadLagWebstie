  Nicky do you work for Barclays? you seem to be defending them, this forum shows otherwise.  I have the T&amp;amp;amp;Cs and no mention of how to cancel.  Also under the Consumer Credit Act, if any organisation carries out a credit check they have to inform you beforehand.  Why should I have to spend time/money sending letters to cancel something I set up in branch 2 days ago  It is now cancelled and I have faxed confirmation of this.  Anybody else wishing to cancel an ISA with Barclays call this number 01133898065 its a ISA processing dept in Leeds.  If they say it has to be in writing, its just a stalling process.  Good luck.....off to Bradford and Bingley rate for life ISA...bit less interest but no hassle.
