  It is coming, I got it for my Business Account last November and my husband has just received it for his current account about 2 months ago.  If you have had a new card but have not had your card reader get onto Barclays.     Mind you, it is a pain in the backside, I hardly log on these days as I can&amp;#039;t be bothered to faff around with it!!  Apparently all the Card Readers are the same so I could use my husbands and vice versa.
