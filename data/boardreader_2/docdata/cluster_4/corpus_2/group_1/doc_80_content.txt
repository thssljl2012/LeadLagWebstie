So am i right in thinking that we are better opting out and paying the 8 per item fee?                      If you don&amp;#039;t mind the hit to your credit record, and have only a small or no authorised overdraft, it could be better to opt out.  If it&amp;#039;s one item only you&amp;#039;ll pay 8 plus your overdraft rate will go up to 27.5%.  Whether this is cheaper than the 22 charge depends on whether it would be just one transaction and whether you have a large overdraft balance underneath it (there is no interest on use of the personal reserve, though you still have to pay interest on the rest of your overdraft, but at your usual rate not the unauthorised rate).     If you must stay as a Barclays customer, it is likely most people will be safer with the reserve in place.  But if you can shop around you may find a better option elsewhere.
