    Barclays Premiership      Saturday, 23rd August                  Tottenham looking to bounce back after their suprise defeat to Middlesbrough last weekend. Speculation links Berbatov with a move to United, but no confirmations on that have been made.    Sunderland&amp;#039;s Tanio is recovering from a thigh injury and won&amp;#039;t feature against his former club. Cisse and David Healys transfers most likely will be completed by Saturday. Both clubs have no major injury worries.           Any Takers?     Add another 5 slots to Sunderland and &amp;amp;quot;draw&amp;amp;quot; if the first 5 fill up.
