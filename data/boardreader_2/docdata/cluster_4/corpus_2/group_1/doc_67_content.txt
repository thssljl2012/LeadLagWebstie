  I had a call from Barclays a while ago, they told me Id gone over my O/D limit by 3.50. They hadnt written or anything and this was the first I knew about about, so I was suprised to hear it was the collections dep calling. No problem I said and I gave them debit card details to bring it back up, The chap on the phone was very nice about it actually.    Checked my credit file and barclays have recorded a big red AP (arrangement to pay) on it presumably trashing my score. Is that right? surely it should have been a &amp;#039;1&amp;#039; it was in arrears for less than a week.
