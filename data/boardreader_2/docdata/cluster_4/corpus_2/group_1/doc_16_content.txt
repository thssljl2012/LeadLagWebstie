  Hello, i am planning on sending off to get a copy of all the fines and charges i have paid in order of getting some back    what i want to know is, i shall be requesting charges for 2 current accounts at barclays that are now closed but closed less then 2 years ago, and one barclaycard account.     Do i have to pay the 10 fee three times? or as all three are barclays accounts i just pay once?    thanks peeps
