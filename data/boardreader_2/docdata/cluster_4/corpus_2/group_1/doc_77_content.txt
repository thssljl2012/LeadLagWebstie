  I&amp;#039;ve just applied for the above online and Ive just noticed that it won&amp;#039;t allow transfers from other  cash ISA&amp;#039;s . I was hoping to transfer my NS&amp;amp;amp;I  Direct ISA,  so what is the difference between NS&amp;amp;amp;I&amp;#039;s  &amp;#039;cash ISA&amp;#039; and their   &amp;#039;Direct ISA&amp;#039;  and will I be allowed?     I&amp;#039;ve checked the NS&amp;amp;amp;I site and the only difference I can see between the direct and cash ISA are the amount needed to open the ISA, conditions of withdrawl etc.     Am I missing the point? Is the Barclays ISA referring to all other ISA&amp;#039;s full stop except those using stocks and shares?     Cheers
