  Our ISA &amp;amp;quot;advisor&amp;amp;quot; rang back today following our query about the interest being backdated.  He originally said it would be backdated to the day cheque was received.      He told us that Barclays &amp;amp;quot;moved the goal post&amp;amp;quot; after gave us the information and, after expressing our displeasure, he is arranging for a cheque to be sent to both OH and myself for 10 each which he says covers the interest on the 3,600 we each put in on 9th April up to the 14th day.      He confirmed that interest will be paid from the 14th day after initial application and that at present the ISA dept is currently working on the batch prior to ours and ours will be dealt with in a couple of weeks, making it at least 6 weeks from application.  This is after he assured us at our interview that Barclays &amp;amp;quot;learned from the mistakes of last year and have laid on extra staff this year and it will only take a couple of weeks to open&amp;amp;quot;.      At least we&amp;#039;ve got the interest out of them.  And we definitely wont be going through this fiasco next year!
