         Barclays on-line banking shows a debit to my account this morning for a cheque for 5,000. I haven&amp;#039;t issued it, and in fact the cheque number quoted is still within the cheque book, in my office safe. Unfortunately (and suspiciously) there are just enough funds in the account to cover the amount of the cheque.  I phoned Barclays Premier Banking to report my suspicions, and request that payment of the cheque be refused. Their response was that their procedures cannot allow this. Instead they have to retrieve a copy of the cheque, mail it to me, and then I have to go into my local branch and prove that I still have the unissued cheque!!!  I pointed out that this process will take the best part of a week or more, by which time Barclays will have a write-off on its hands. Also, it affects my availability of funds in the meantime, because I am 5,000 short. Seems that&amp;#039;s just my tough luck.  It seems strange that when I recently issued a large cheque (five figures), on the afternoon of the day it hit the account I received a phone call from Barclays to verify that I really did issue it. Once they were happy, they said &amp;amp;quot;Thanks, we shall authorise its payment.&amp;amp;quot; So why can&amp;#039;t they de-authorise the payment of today&amp;#039;s item?
