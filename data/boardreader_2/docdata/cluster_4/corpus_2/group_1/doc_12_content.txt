 Barclays do give you a debit card if you get your parent&amp;#039;s permission if you are under 16. I have a Barclays Visa Debit card atm. Also to the post above I can go overdrawn on my bank account.         Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Sunny,                         Debit card is your best chance.

Though my other account with Natwest gives you an Solo Debit Card which allows you to buy stuff anywhere and is useable on paypal.    Natwest  Loyds TSB  Halifax  HSBC  They all give you Debit cards useable online.     You have to get your parent to open the account for you though    Its worth it, i got verified on paypal within 3 days.
