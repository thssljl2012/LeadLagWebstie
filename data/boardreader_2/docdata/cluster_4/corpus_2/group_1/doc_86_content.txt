  Do all banks use this security now?? I have just tried to transfer some money urgently to my wifes account in a different bank and because it&amp;#039;s a new payment I cant do it      because ------I don&amp;#039;t have pin sentry      I tried to do it by phone but that takes 3 days to transfer---wot a larf- my cash and I can&amp;#039;t choose where it goes .  Time to look for another bank.   Barclays current account interest is rubbish anyway
