  You are at fault I&amp;#039;m afraid. Enough money being in your account is your responsibility. I thought it was common for deposits after 3.30pm to be processed the day after? (I guess you know this, that&amp;#039;s why you said 3.40pm)    But moving on from that, if you have been a barclays customer for a long time, just phone up and complain. This is what my Dad does every time: &amp;amp;quot;I was probably a Barclays customer before you were born&amp;amp;quot;. Say it&amp;#039;s totally unreasable for only 2.78 etc.I also advise you to ask for an arranged overdraft for next time.
