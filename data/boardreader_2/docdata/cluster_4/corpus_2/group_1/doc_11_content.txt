Most of the info I&amp;#039;ve seen is relating to bank charges from years ago on overdrafts etc which is rather confusing.     If so, what do we do now? Pay the 30 fine then send off the letters and wait?     Thanks                      This may sound like a dig so I apologise in advance.     I cannot see the problem with being charged 30 for going over any agreed overdraft limit. We are all aware of the rules and charges banks make so it the fault of your g/f for breaking the rules. The simple solution is not to go over your overdraft limit.     I have never gone overdrawn as I am aware of charges I will incur so it is frustrating to hear people winging about these charges.     It is about time I received something from the banks for being an A1 account holder etc.     If you know the cost of any default DO NOT default - simple really
