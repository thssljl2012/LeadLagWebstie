     What&amp;#039;s happened?          On Monday 18 August, Barclays radically changed the overdraft facilities it offers. It now has 3 levels:         1. Normal Overdraft     : Up to a limit e.g. 500 you&amp;amp;#8217;re simply charged interest at the agreed rate.        2. Personal Reserve.      Go beyond that and within a set limit e.g. 250 more, you pay 22 to go into the personal reserve for five days and regardless of any other transactions there&amp;amp;#8217;s no additional interest or fees.        3. Above that.  Go beyond that, and  each  transaction paid out costs 8.          Is it worth it - what&amp;#039;s you&amp;#039;re view     These new charges are cheaper than the old version for most people.   However compared to the year&amp;#039;s 0&amp;amp;#37; overdraft and 100 you can get if you move to the       Best Bank Account  its still not that good.     Better still, do a  budget  and  money makeover  to get back into the black so any charges are irrelevant anyway.
