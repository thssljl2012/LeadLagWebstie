  It&amp;#039;s a waste of time.  I went into Barclays and registered for on-line banking.  They sent me a PinSentry.   I went into Barclays and told them I wanted to close my account because they sent me a PinSentry.  I was told not to close my account as I could be registered for on-line banking without a PinSentry and that I should have been given this option when I registered for on-line banking.  They sent me a letter saying I couldn&amp;#039;t be registered for on-line banking without a PinSentry as I was registered for online banking with a PinSentry.  I cut up my paying in book, cheque book and debit card and sent it to Barclays along with  this .  They didn&amp;#039;t transfer my balance to my Halifax account as requested so I had to make a complaint after which they sent me a cheque.
