 We can&amp;#039;t give you financial advice because when you decide to take any action with your cash, you need to do it in the context of your total financial situation - for instance, if you had debts it would probably be a good idea to clear these first before making decisions about savings.      But assuming you are just wanting some help with finding a suitable savings account, David Black, head of banking at Defaqto, has this to say:      &amp;amp;quot;If you&amp;#039;re considering a savings account you could make use of your Cash ISA allowance.      Cash ISAs can&amp;amp;#8217;t be held in joint names and the maximum annual investment is 3,600 per individual so you would have to open two accounts (ie. one in each name).&amp;amp;quot;      The maximum deposit per tax year is 3,600 and once you&amp;amp;#8217;ve deposited this amount you can&amp;amp;#8217;t then replace any subsequently withdrawn funds in that tax year. (So if you deposited 3,600 and withdrew 2,000, you couldn&amp;#039;t top up the account again within the tax year. If you deposited 3,000 and withdrew 2,000 you COULD top up the account - as long as the individual bank or building society&amp;#039;s terms and conditions allowed further deposits- but only by 600, so that the total amount deposited - albeit on two separate occasions - would be no more than 3,600.      The highest instant/easy access Cash ISAs at the moment are offered by Barclays &amp;amp;amp; HSBC, who both pay 6.25% gross AER.      The Barclays Tax Haven ISA can be opened and operated at a branch but its 6.25% variable rate includes a 1% introductory bonus for a year so be prepared to move your money elsewhere after the introductory period  if it becomes uncompetitive.      The HSBC Cash e-ISA has to be opened via the internet if you can do this.        Black adds: &amp;amp;quot;If you don&amp;amp;#8217;t want an ISA, the highest easy access savings account is currently the Kaupthing Edge Savings Account which pays 6.55% gross for 100+ but its only available as an internet account ( www.kaupthing-edge.co.uk ).      Non-ISA savings accounts can be held in joint names.      If you&amp;amp;#8217;re not able (or happy) to use the internet for your savings it might be worth looking at the Anglo Irish Bank which has developed a reputation  of offering consistently competitive accounts.       Anglo Irish Bank currently offers two postal/telephone based accounts which may be of interest:                           Easy Access Account issue 2 paying 6.40% gross AER for 1+                           7 Day Notice Account issue 2 paying 6.55% gross AER for 1+      Anglo Irish Bank can be contacted on 0845 455 2222         Depending upon your tax status you may find that they can get paid gross interest (even on non-ISA accounts) on their savings by signing an R85 form when you open  an account and you should discuss this with the bank/building society that you choose. The bank/b soc will be able to supply the R85 form.&amp;amp;quot;
