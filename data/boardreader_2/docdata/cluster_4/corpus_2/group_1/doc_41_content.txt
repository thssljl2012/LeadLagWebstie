  I applied for the Barclays Tax Haven ISA at the beginning of April 2008.     I had to go in to the branch three times as they didn&amp;#039;t complete the application process correctly. The account was eventually opened but they didn&amp;#039;t pay in my cheque or backdate the interest.     I complained and after chasing every single week since the beginning of May 2008, I asked for a final response to be sent so that I could take it to the Financial Ombudsmen Service. This will cost Barclays 450 initial + around 150 investigation.      Advice to everyone - complain once and make sure you have written evidence of it. After seven weeks, ask for a final response (it doesn&amp;#039;t actually matter whether you receive this or not) then go straight to the Financial Ombudsmen Service  http://www.financial-ombudsmen.org.uk .      I don&amp;#039;t want to bore anyone with the details of my case, but it&amp;#039;s clear they have the cheque, as front facing staff can see it scanned in, but back office staff cannot. Supervisors tell me they have a backlog of &amp;#039;investigations&amp;#039;!     In my complaint to the Financial Ombudsmen Service, I have also noted the regulatory failings of Barclays Bank in terms of FSA guidelines, The Banking Code etc. Working for a rival bank actually pays off!
