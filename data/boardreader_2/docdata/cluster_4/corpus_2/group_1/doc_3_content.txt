  Sunderland  v  Man City         Steed Malbranque is unlikely to play in Sunderland&amp;#039;s Barclays Premier League game against Manchester City on Sunday after injuring his ankle in the Carling Cup at Nottingham Forest on Wednesday.        Anton Ferdinand will not be included after signing from West Ham this week, as he is not match fit.        Michael Chopra is suspended and Teemu Tainio remains on the injured list.        Kieran Richardson faces a late fitness check on a rib injury.        Phil Bardsley is ready to cap a good week by helping Sunderland beat Manchester City.        The 23-year-old defender scored his first goal in English football when he got the equaliser in the Black Cats&amp;#039; 2-1 Carling Cup win at Nottingham Forest on Wednesday.        Sunderland return to Barclays Premier League action against City at the Stadium of Light and, as a Manchester United fan and a former player at Old Trafford, Bardsley has an extra incentive for wanting three points.        City, though, have beaten Sunderland in their last six Premier League meetings and Bardsley admits he is looking forward to taking them on.        &amp;amp;quot;It would be nice to get one over City,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Bardsley. &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;ve had two good wins in the last week and it would be fantastic to make it three in a row.        &amp;amp;quot;I just want to do my best and help Sunderland get three points, regardless of who it&amp;#039;s against, but the City game is a good one for me.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;        Mark Hughes reported no new injury concerns after Manchester City&amp;#039;s UEFA Cup qualifier against FC Midtjylland as he quickly turns his attention to Sunday&amp;#039;s trip to Sunderland.        Hughes&amp;#039; men had to endure extra-time and penalties in Denmark to secure a place in the UEFA Cup first round last night.        Micah Richards came through the match without any problems having suffered concussion against West Ham last week, while Hughes will be able to recall Vincent Kompany, who was ineligible for the European qualifier, for the trip to Wearside.        Benjani Mwaruwari and Kelvin Etuhu did not travel to Denmark while Valeri Bojinov and Darius Vassell are long-term casualties.        Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart is convinced the Eastlands club are set for big things now Shaun Wright-Phillips has returned.        Wright-Phillips is expected to be included in Mark Hughes&amp;#039; squad for the trip to Sunderland after signing a four-year deal with City.        Pablo Zabaleta is also expected to agree terms over the weekend, further bolstering the Blues.        And Hart, the spot-kick hero in Thursday&amp;#039;s UEFA Cup win over Midtjylland, is confident of the future again.        &amp;amp;quot;Good things are happening at the moment and hopefully they will keep going,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Hart.        &amp;amp;quot;Shaun Wright-Phillips coming back is great for the fans and for the team.        &amp;amp;quot;He is a huge player and it is really exciting for everyone.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;        That Wright-Phillips agreed to rejoin City before they had booked a UEFA Cup first-round tie with Omonia Nicosia has offered a belief that maybe the situation at Eastlands is not quite as turbulent as some would believe.        Hughes certainly thinks so.        &amp;amp;quot;There is a well-documented issue surrounding the owner of the football club,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.        &amp;amp;quot;It is a situation people have an interest in worldwide.        &amp;amp;quot;But he has shown his commitment to the club by this investment in it and I am determined to take it to the next level.        &amp;amp;quot;We have been waiting a long time for people to start writing positive things.        &amp;amp;quot;We are attempting to make the club better.        &amp;amp;quot;The signings of people like Shaun, we hope, will make people change their view.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;        Courtesy: Soccernet            I can&amp;#039;t see Sunderland winning without Malbraque in the team. They are really weak to say the least. Man City will be boosted by the 3-0 win over West Ham last week.
