  This is on my account although I do not intend to use it.      But I may have this all wrong but this is what I gather.    I spend more than my overdraft and then I need a direct debit to be paid.      The old way was Barclays refused it and charged you. The company it was being paid to didn&amp;#039;t get paid and hit you with a late payment charge. ~or~ They paid it and charged you 35 for doing so. They could do this once a day upto 3 times a month. So charges could be 105 for the month.   This way, I see it that they will pay the direct debit and only charge you 22 for every 5 days you are in the reserve. Will work out at approx 132 for 6 lots of 5 in a month. So it is more expensive if you will constantly be over the overdraft limit.   But if your direct debits go out on Friday and your money doesn&amp;#039;t go in until Monday it will only cost you 22. A bit better than the original 35.      I personally think it&amp;#039;s swings and roundabouts. Very hard to compare but both equally as horrible.
