Halifax, Lloyds and barclays all offer their own basic accounts as well with visa electron as far as I can see from their websites.                      All the banks named (bar BoS/Halifax) have replaced Visa Electron with Visa Debit.  Co-op, BoS/Halifax, and in some instances, Abbey will issue Visa Electron cards.     The only way to get a Visa Electron from Barclays is to buy a gift card for 3.    UK Visa Electron cards usually start 4917 or 4508 if that helps.
