As the account was &amp;amp;quot;closed&amp;amp;quot; five years ago we now have no statements or any record of the   bank account   number or anything. we just wondered where we stood on this. thanks                      As galling as it might be I suspect that Natan&amp;#039;s right about it being best to pay up for now, to protect your credit rating, and try and get the money back later. Unless you&amp;#039;ve got something in writing confirming that the account was closed, which it sounds like you probably haven&amp;#039;t.  Maybe I just spent too long in the civil service, but I swear by getting important stuff like this confirmed in writing whenever possible. *shrug*    Hope you manage to get it all sorted swiftly and painlessly!
