                                                              Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Fishmeister                            I was told by a barclays manager that because I dipped into the &amp;#039;Reserve&amp;#039; I automatically recieved a &amp;#039;Reserve Fee&amp;#039; of 22 pounds. When I stated that this is a fancy way of saying &amp;#039;Bank Charge&amp;#039; she said that they are completely different. I fail to see the difference!. Is this Barclays new way of avoiding the Bank charge reclaim?.      I did not recieve the money back as the manager was adement that the bank would under no circumstances, refund it back to me. She said that letters were sent to everyone explaining the &amp;#039;Reserve Fee&amp;#039; but I recieved no letter and the first time I saw it was when I was on my Internet banking a few days previously.                         I would fight this charge as stated by  barclays FAQ        Q.    If my balance goes into my Reserve during the course of the day, but my balance is back within my overdraft limit (or back in credit, where I don&amp;amp;#8217;t have an overdraft) by the end of the day, will I be charged?             A  .  No .  You will not incur a Reserve Usage Fee if your balance (does not exceed your overdraft limit)  (or, where you don&amp;amp;#8217;t have an overdraft limit, your account is in credit)  at the end of the working day.            EDIT... READ THEIR REPLY CAREFULLY NO MENTION OF RESERVE                                                           Oh can you please     shut up    yes i am deaf but i can lip read                                                     Last edited by lifesuckssometimes : Yesterday at  12:39 PM .
