  Sorry, there is a provision with Barlcays for amounts up to &amp;#039;5&amp;#039; beyond your overdraft to no attract charges - but not &amp;#039;300&amp;#039; - so I think you will be charged.    Had Faster Payments worked Barclays would have had the money in the account as an &amp;#039;overnight&amp;#039; receipt that might have successfully offset the items due for payment and, from being bounced, overted any charges.    [See the other thread on this board about Lloyds and FP] Lloyds won&amp;#039;t process an instruction for a payment over the weekend anyway at present - so that customers can only make FPs - by direct request - during Monday to Friday. (And even then, that&amp;#039;s when it works. Lloyds wasn&amp;#039;t even connected to FP this morning and payments out were scheduled via BACS to leave Tuesday!)    Your best bet is to go in to Barclays today with your cash and apologise profusely over not being able to get it to them sooner. (Who know? banks charges aren&amp;#039;t exactly &amp;#039;legal&amp;#039; after all?)    Update: If you&amp;#039;d still had the cash in your Lloyds account today then it is possible to draw the available balance as cash &amp;#039;over-the-counter&amp;#039; of your branch using just theATM card with PIN (sufficient ID?) I was able to draw 1000 today - the amount I requested - that way. Useful to know as a fall back for future occasions...
