  Arsenal v Newcastle: Preview         Arsenal have no fresh injury worries ahead of the Barclays Premier League clash with Newcastle at Emirates Stadium.        Captain William Gallas and forward Theo Walcott (both knee) have recovered from minor knocks picked up in the midweek Champions League victory over FC Twente, while winger Samir Nasri has shaken off a virus.        Midfielder Cesc Fabregas came through unscathed following his return from a hamstring problem, but new signing Mikael Silvestre (thigh), Tomas Rosicky (hamstring), Abou Diaby (thigh), Amaury Bischoff (groin) and striker Eduardo (leg) remain in recovery.        Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan has promised the club&amp;#039;s fans an influx of top signings after sanctioning James Milner&amp;#039;s 10million switch to Aston Villa.        Keegan travels to Arsenal with a squad ravaged by injuries and summer departures, the most notable of them England Under-21 international Milner&amp;#039;s move to Villa.        With only three days to go before Monday&amp;#039;s transfer deadline, the Magpies&amp;#039; squad is desperately thin, a fact that was perhaps reflected by the swathes of empty seats at St James&amp;#039; Park for last Saturday&amp;#039;s 1-0 win over Bolton.        However, having held talks with club owner Mike Ashley and executive director (football) Dennis Wise on Wednesday, a surprisingly upbeat Keegan remains hopeful of recruiting up to four more new faces by the time the summer window closes.        He said: &amp;amp;quot;We had a great meeting. The owner is absolutely totally committed to the club, there is no doubt about that, and it is a case of us trying to get the quality we want in.        &amp;amp;quot;The secret is to pick the right ones, it&amp;#039;s to make sure if you are going to let a good player go, you replace him with another quality player who maybe can take you in a slightly different direction as a team.        &amp;amp;quot;That&amp;#039;s the challenge we have now and I look forward to that. I would think there is a very good chance of getting three or four players in.        &amp;amp;quot;Mike can only give us the ammunition that is the finance. We have got to go and find the players, and they have got to be the right players.        &amp;amp;quot;So far, we haven&amp;#039;t seen a massive influx of players into the club.        &amp;amp;quot;But I don&amp;#039;t think any Newcastle fan would argue that the ones we have fetched in they see as quality and see as the right sort of players for Newcastle United, players who care and players who are putting a shirt on and doing a good shift for the club.        &amp;amp;quot;That will continue to be the way we look for players and if, because we can&amp;#039;t get those sort of players, we don&amp;#039;t fetch the volume in and a fair number, so be it.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;        Joey Barton could make a surprise return to the Newcastle squad following Milner&amp;#039;s departure and the news that Geremi has a knee ligament injury.
