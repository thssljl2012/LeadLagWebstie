Barclays offered me a 10 check for phone calls etc and when that didnt arrive  a 30 one.  After a couple of weeks  I asked where the 30 was.    The idiots had simply added my 30 gesture to an already fully funded ISA taking it over the limit.  I have now had it sorted out and have a letter to show the IR if they ever complain.  Time taken to open an ISA?  Four and a half months!    Barclays?  Never again.    B
