  As a soon to be ex-customer of Barclays this &amp;amp;quot;improvement&amp;amp;quot; to my account is nothing more than another money trap for the unwary, but a honey pot for Barclays. Go overdrawn or overdraw your overdraft limit by 1 and get charged 22, even if only for a day! What is the apr for that I wonder. My calculator doesn&amp;#039;t have enough zeroes.
