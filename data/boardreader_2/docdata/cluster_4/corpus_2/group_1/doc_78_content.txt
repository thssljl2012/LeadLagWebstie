  I work for Barclays (Barclaycard precisely) and had no idea what to do once I received my letter explaining the new facilities and telling me how to opt out if I wished!!   As my personal account ( which my salary is paid into) is linked to our main account which is the Offset Mortgage package ( we got that when it was Woolwich and much preferred to deal with them!!) I was not expecting my account to be placed under the new rules, but hey ho!   As staff we have just had some info about new pension payments - my husband took mine to his work to get their account to give it the once over - it was written in such a way that I couldn&amp;#039;t make head or tail of that either.
