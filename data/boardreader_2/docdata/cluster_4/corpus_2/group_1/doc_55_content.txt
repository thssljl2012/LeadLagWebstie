  I have been charged 30 (+ 22 reserve= 52 for just 5.48overdrawn : THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS) by barclays yesterday for being over my limit of 180 by 5.48. This the 1st charge since maybe 2years now.     I sent my claim in 2months ago for an amount that round 1500 but they ve been sending me letter 1st asking about my hardship and then two different saying each my case as been reffered to an other department... these letter were more concern about how they could help me with my hardship ...  Im fuming cause im not getting nowhere at the moment
