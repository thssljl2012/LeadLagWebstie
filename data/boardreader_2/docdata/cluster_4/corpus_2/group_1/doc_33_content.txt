                                                         Thanks for all the replies, in response to some queries I will give you some more detail what happened.. I thought I had more in my account than there was (a direct debit had been taken out) I withdrew 20 pound 6pm on Wednesday 20th which put me into the Reserve. At midnight (6 hours later) I got paid, and I got the reserve fee.    This is nothing but another way for Barclays to issue a bank charge!. They can call it what they like but to take money out of someones account for going over a limit is a charge!.    Eydon - In response to your post, I spoke to some friends at work who are with Barclays and they all recieved letters. I have no idea why I didn&amp;#039;t and I open all letters they send to me. I use my internet banking about once a week but usually quickly go on to pay a bill or check my balance so I must have just not noticed the &amp;#039;Reserve&amp;#039; adverts. Given the choice I would not have opted out, but to issue a charge (oh, sorry.. fee!)  as soon as you enter the reserve is no better than what they were doing before. Maybe if you are in the reserve for a few days, then a (reasonable) fee would be more appropriate??
