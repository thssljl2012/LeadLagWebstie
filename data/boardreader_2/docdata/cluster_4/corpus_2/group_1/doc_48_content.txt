Phoned them and they do not have a reason why this happened and as such as complaint has now been registered.     They are bl...dy USELESS.                         UPDATE UPDATE.     Well I have now been advised that the Inland Revenue will not allow them to open the account.  However Barclays have credited my account with 220.00 as loss of interest and compensation for the error.
