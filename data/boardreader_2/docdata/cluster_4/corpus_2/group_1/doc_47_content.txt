  Barclays were the same with me - awkward!     About a week after going BR I recieved a letter from them saying they&amp;#039;d been notified and that due to this they were closing my accounts I had with them, righting what was owed to &amp;#039;bad debt&amp;#039; - quite obvious     Then recieved about a month later a letter demanding I get in contact with them as I hadnt sent them a token payment - for the account which was closed!!!     For once I actually called them up and said that I was declared BR on 9 May, that I&amp;#039;d been sent a letter from one office of Barclays closing my account, yet I then get a letter from &amp;#039;you&amp;#039; stating I should have paid something - I did tell them they they&amp;#039;re clearly not talking to one another (their offices) - that seemed to shut her up!
