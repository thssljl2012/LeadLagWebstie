        QUOTE (wwbtbl &amp;amp;#064; Jul 16 2008, 05&amp;amp;#58;52 AM)       Banks don&amp;#039;t really care what other banks are on consumers report, they look at the whole report. Juniper is not sub-prime. They are like every other mid-size card issuer and offer a wide variety of card products to attract customers, and all banks have some form of sub-prime credit card product even if they try to disguise what it is. For example Citi will issue cards from Associates National Bank sub-prime and the sneaky way where it looks like a Citi card but will be issued by and report from Citibank USA this is also a sub-prime product. You may not like their service NYRFANN, many don&amp;#039;t me included, but they are not sub-prime and other banks don&amp;#039;t care any way and most of their underwriters don&amp;#039;t even know what cards are or not sub-prime.     Absolutely true. Too many people think &amp;amp;quot;subprime&amp;amp;quot; means &amp;amp;quot;they weren&amp;#039;t nice to me.&amp;amp;quot; It means, for the most part,  predatory . &amp;amp;quot;High rates, high fees, low limits&amp;amp;quot; is the basic mantra of the subprime card (and in most cases, CARDS are subprime, not issuers, as pointed out in the above post). Barclays, like most issuers, offers everything from subprime to superprime cards. My Barclays cards are 6.9% fixed and 7.9% fixed, with high limits and no fees. Hardly &amp;amp;quot;subprime.&amp;amp;quot; (The 6.9% card is headed to BoA, but from all indications, my rate is grandfathered in.) AmEx has recently been CLD&amp;#039;ing people for no reason... are they also &amp;amp;quot;subprime&amp;amp;quot;? Even Capital One offers superprime cards. Their service may be SUBPAR, but that doesn&amp;#039;t make all their cards SUBPRIME.  Charging you a late fee when you were late doesn&amp;#039;t make an issuer or a card subprime. Rude or stupid CSRs don&amp;#039;t make an issuer or card subprime. Being pissed off at them doesn&amp;#039;t make an issuer or card subprime. The  terms of the account  make an issuer or card subprime. We need to stop misusing that term, because it&amp;#039;s confusing and misleading.
