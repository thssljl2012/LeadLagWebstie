 Barclays has just advised me of changes to my current account that will automatically take effect from 18/08/2008 unless I opt out. They are introducing a personal reserve, over and above any overdraft, which incurs a usage fee. I&amp;#039;d like to hear other people&amp;#039;s views on the personal reserve because I&amp;#039;m not entirely convinced it will work in favour of the account holder. Thanks.
