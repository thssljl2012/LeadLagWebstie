What a painful and stupid level of security. Not only can you not transfer, login with out this little gem and your card. But its going to take 7 days to arrive but then it has to go overseas! How many of us abroad have all these things with us all the time - let alone in the uk??!  Ridiculous.      If I could change bank in the UK now I would - problem is - i am here.                           Yes, I discovered this some weeks ago. I tried to transfer some money to my brother&amp;#039;s account, but couldn&amp;#039;t without the doofer. I ended up sanding him a cheque, as I had managed to conveniently bring my Sterling cheque books with me.         S
