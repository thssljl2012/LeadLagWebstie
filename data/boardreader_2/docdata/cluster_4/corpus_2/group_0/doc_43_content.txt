  In my case, Barclays are offering me a loan of at most  150 for up to a week, so interest of   22 is extortianate! The effective annual rate of interest would only make any sense in Zimbabwe (it&amp;#039;s about 120,000%).    jarviser comes off better. Because the interest is fixed at   22, the scheme becomes more competitive as the personal reserve offered gets larger.He was offered a loan of   1,000. In the best case scenario where jarviser uses the entire reserve on Monday and then only pays it back on the following Sunday, the APR is now 210%. Still eyewatering but no longer catastrophic.    For comparison, to achieve an APR as low as a particularly bad credit card, you&amp;#039;d have to be offered a reserve of   3390, for which the APR is 39.8%.  And for a competitive loan with an APR of 10%, you&amp;#039;d need a reserve of   12,000.   Remember that these APRs are far higher if you don&amp;#039;t use the whole reserve amount, or pay it back earlier than you have to.    So I&amp;#039;ll be opting out of the scheme until I&amp;#039;m offered a five figure reserve! My guess is that Barclays are trying to make the penalties that are being reclaimed become legally sound fees. You can watch their videos at  http://www.barclays.co.uk/personalreserve/  where Mr Average - drama teacher Sam Parker - faces everyday struggles but gets through the week with the help of his personal reserve. Cynics like me are left with a sore taste in our mouths.    My impression is that consumer banking is subsidised by those suffering the greatest financial difficulty - who don&amp;#039;t have strong enough credit ratings to take an ordinary loan, and are often on the edge of their overdraft limit. While this makes sense financially since banks are loathe to charge customers in credit who provide the bank with deposits to invest, and it even subsidises my own banking, it doesn&amp;#039;t seem particulary fair.    Other charging schemes include monthly accross the board rates, not paying interest on current accounts in credit (my rate is 0.1% so I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;d miss it), or charging for actual costs incurred e.g. a penny per cheque, a penny for cashback, perhaps even a pound for seeing a cashier.    Any of these might be far better ways of taking the stress out of Sam Parker&amp;#039;s week than the personal reserve.    Josh
