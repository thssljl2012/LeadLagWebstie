I have also had problems most of the day trying to get into Barclays.  Anyone know what the problem is with them today or is it just a computer problem!!!!!!  I got in once about 10 minutes ago but when i clicked on to my account it just gave an error message again - so couldn&amp;#039;t do what i wanted to do.
