  We got a letter and they will credit the ISA with 50 because they could not open the new ISA because they are too stupid to swap an old ISA into a new one. Because if one wants to take part in a new ISA one needs to stop the Direct Debit into the current ISA at least 6 weeks before the new ISA comes out. Otherwise their computers cannot cope as one cannot have two ISA&amp;#039;s at the same time.     I know the government wants to be nice and give us a little extra (very little it is though). But the banks need to get a grip and Barclays is just a joke when it comes to this.      I think they cannot cope and will fob off some with 50 of potentially lost interest or some other stupid rule, just to get all those complaints off their tables.     Well, I made a reminder to stop the DD in middle Feb and then manually pay in on March to ensure I can have the better ISA in April if there is one.
