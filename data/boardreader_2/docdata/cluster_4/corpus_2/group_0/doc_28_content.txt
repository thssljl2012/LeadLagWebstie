Yeah thanks tiggrae but really there would be no unfair rebate if the ppi thing and the extra 40 months were sorted out. I am on a personal mission here because its something that i REALLY believe in.      That loan and whoever sold it to us really messed up our lives. It was something that haunted me then and still haunts me now. We were in debt but pushed into more debt by adding this ppi on and really looking at what they gave to Firstplus about my husbands income it looks like it was frauded in the first place by whoever brokered the loan. Why would they have a false wage address there and also when we &amp;amp;quot;google earth&amp;amp;quot; that address its a terraced house. I don&amp;#039;t think we would of earned enought to get it in the first place. These things i need to find out.     I do feel strong about it and want my money back. I was quite ill when we took the loan out (i did send documented proof to FOS about both things and dated letters) and then developed something else at the time of settlement and i had to let our solicitor deal with it. My health came first but i did complain to FP so many times about having no &amp;amp;quot;documents&amp;amp;quot;. They said in phone calls that these were given to us by &amp;amp;quot;BRKWILM&amp;amp;quot; Freedom finance at the we applied.
