Congrats&amp;amp;#33;  ETA - got my card in the mail yesterday.    Thanks, cb_opus. You know, I&amp;#039;ve been VERY pleased with the Barclays people so far, maybe it&amp;#039;s a different bunch handling the L.L.Bean accounts. Bob P.S. Maybe YOU should call and ask for a bump [not the fist type].        heh&amp;amp;#33;  Think I&amp;#039;m gonna hold off - unlike you, oh great one   this is my largest CL to date - they really have no incentive to CLI me yet, and I don&amp;#039;t want to attract their attention yet, given everything I&amp;#039;ve heard.  ETA:  BofA LLBean was &amp;amp;#036;17.5k, and Juni gave me &amp;amp;#036;19k.  And I&amp;#039;m still sitting with &amp;amp;#036;1k from Cabelas.  feh.  They really need to auto cli me.
