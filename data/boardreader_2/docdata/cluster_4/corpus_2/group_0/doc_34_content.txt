Well, we ended up doing telephone banking to the UK each night for 5 nights to transfer money to the HiFx account in the UK so that they could transfer the money to our account here.      Not to mention trying to withdraw cash here on our connect cards to keep having it declined and saying &amp;#039;contact your bank&amp;#039; so another evening of telephoning Barclays in the UK to get them to reactivate our cards once we had assured them we weren&amp;#039;t fraudsters!!      I know they are trying to protect us from fraud but what a performance.                           we had the same kinda problems when we moved over last time,so while in barclays paying our bond on a property over in oz last week i thought i&amp;#039;d ask if there was anything we could do about it before we fly back out and it turns out they have a thing called &amp;#039;destination flagline&amp;#039; and you just ring and let them know that you&amp;#039;ll be in australia for X amount of time so they know the card and account will be being used over there. the number is 0844 5560083.   not rang them yet but the lady said thats all we need ro do.
