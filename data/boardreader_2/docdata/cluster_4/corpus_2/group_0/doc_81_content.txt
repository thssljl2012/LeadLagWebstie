      &amp;amp;quot;Personal Reserve is designed to act as a safety net for customers who exceed their agreed overdraft limit if they have one or go overdrawn if they dont.    This gives customers the peace of mind that payments will be met, putting the customer in control of their finances.   &amp;amp;quot;  Errr, doesn&amp;amp;#96;t this give BARCLAYS peace of mind that it is they who will be getting control of their customer&amp;amp;#96;s finances ?  My recent experiences with the major banks has not been good (see my post on the Natiowide halts ISA transfers thread). Now I read this. These banks are turning into a nasty bunch of b***ards (they probably were before, but now the credit crunch is biting they are showing their true colours).
