You are going to have to wait until Barclays verifies if the money has gone in by seeing if you where in the branch by looking the at the images from the CCTV cameras.    If they don&amp;#039;t come back to you shortly then I suggest you  contact  customer services in writing. I don&amp;#039;t know how long banks keep their CCTV tapes before recording over them.     In the mean time you need to contact Barclays and arrange an overdraft.     If the CCTV shows that you were in the branch then you can ask for the charges to be cancelled.     If the CCTV cameras show that you were not in the branch then unfortunately you have lost your money, and there is nothing you can do.
