  I have a Barclays Tax Haven ISA and have been told by Barclays it pays 6.06% interest.      I noticed that my interest payments have gone down the last three months so I questioned the amount. After a few minutes they came back and offered the amount that was short last month but I have escalated it and asked them to look into all interest payments.     Check yours now as I don&amp;#039;t understand how they can get it wrong if it is automatically calculated.      If mine is wrong so might yours be
