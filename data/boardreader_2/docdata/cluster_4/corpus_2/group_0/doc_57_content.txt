Am I right in thinking I could go to a HSBC cash machine in Perth and withdraw cash from my Uk account? or is that too easy?                        i still have my HSBC UK account.... not sure about the withdrawing cash Q though as we dont have a branch here, i only use it for internet banking and buying from Amazon!
