height=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;&amp;gt;        Coincidentally I&amp;#039;ve just received my Barclays Travel Money Card which they offer in GBP, USD or Euro versions.  This one is accepted at any VISA ATM or retailer who accepts VISA and the charges for use are the same as if you use a Debit Card.  Not entirely sure how useful it will be but thought it might give us the option of leaving all our other cards locked in the hotel safe and I can top it up easily with a quick phone call 24hrs a day.
