  Hi, i was wondering if anyone has had experience of this through barclays. It is a business account and i believe with the charges that these accounts incur you should get some kind of interaction with the business manager. However i have tried to contact our new one and her area manager but with no success. Maybe because the message left was regrading a complaint over my parents account.      Does anyone know who i have to esculate this to further above the area manager     thanks  will
