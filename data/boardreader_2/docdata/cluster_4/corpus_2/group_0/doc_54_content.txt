         Hello all,  I hope someone can point me in the right direction.  I have today rcvd a reply from Nationwide and Barclays Bank regarding my letter for claiming bank charges. Both have sent me statements going back 6 years, but both included a letter stating that the matter will not be considered until after the OFT&amp;#039;s claim is concluded.  Is there anything I can do to move forward with this? or have I hit a brick wall? I am only looking to claim as I have suffered severe financial pressure recently, losing my business and I had to goto court to fight for my home, I am now getting myself straight again, but during the very severe part of my financial difficulties I was overdrawn with both banks and both have charged me and I now have a default from both banks logged on my creditfile. Barclays defaulted me at ?250 and I paid this ?250 to clear balance and close account, going through Barclays statements I have over ?2000 in charges. Nationwide was the same, from a 0 balance and 1 missed DD I got upto ?700 overdrawn from charges, not including all the other charges, I now have debt collectors chasing me for this.  Any help or advise would be very much appreciated.  Best regards,  Wesley Millington
