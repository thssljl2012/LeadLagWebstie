        QUOTE (Shawnee &amp;amp;#064; Jun 30 2008, 03&amp;amp;#58;20 PM)       Sure, every bank has complaints but Juniper is just plain wacky. I had heard there was a strong possibility that LL Bean was going with US Bank. I&amp;#039;ve had my issues with them as well but their CS has always been great.     I can count on 1 hand the # of times I&amp;#039;ve had to call CS for any of my credit cards - i have like 48 active cards. I&amp;#039;ve talked to cap1 cs most often -the close the cards. I fully expect i&amp;#039;ll get acceptable CS from any issuer... my concern is the apparent wackiness of juny.    I was denied a biz card last summer - for sufficient credit with juny. I had 1 personal card for 9K. Both chase and boa gave me at least 3 cards each for at least 30K in CL (total per issuer).  It took junami for me to get another juny - approved for 20K (if i recall correctly) - but was cut down to 12K before the card arrived. It was a non-issue for me, as 12K is a sufficient limit to meet my needs, but others were CLD a heck of a lot more or closed outright during junami. A couple of months ago they finally allowed me a biz card - 9K. My initial Juny is about 2 yrs old and never had a CLI. My Boa Bean is just days younger and has seen small but regular autoCLI - its 4K higher at the end of 2 yrs.
