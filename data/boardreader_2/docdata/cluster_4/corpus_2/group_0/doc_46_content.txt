So I can&amp;#039;t check my Tax Haven ISA balance online?     Also, can I just make futher deposits just by doing an online transfer from my Bank of Scotland account to the sort code and account number of provided in the letter?                      Yes you need a Barclays current account as well, which I don&amp;#039;t either hm so at the moment I don&amp;#039;t know how much is in my ISA (I know how much I have deopsited though).    And no idea about further deposits. If you go in store they say you have to transfer from Barclays current account (ha so problem there?), but I was thinking about sending a cheque to the Glasgow office, not sure if it&amp;#039;ll work though. I plan to get into a branch and ask how I can deposit some money, when I have some.
