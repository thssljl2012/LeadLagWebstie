 Barclays Gift card is a Visa electron debit card, the travel money card is a pre-loaded standard visa card.I can see it now. People charging these to their BA Amex or their Tesco CC, and then getting the money back via an ATM or paying themselves back via Paypal (no charge on Paypal to receive a debit card payment)....       http://www.personal.barclays.co.uk/BRC1/jsp/brccontrol?site=pfs&amp;amp;amp;task=homefreegroup&amp;amp;amp;value=12413 Gift Card      http://www.personal.barclays.co.uk/BRC1/jsp/brccontrol?task=homefreegroup&amp;amp;amp;value=13264&amp;amp;amp;target=_  self&amp;amp;amp;site=pfs
