   on behalf of familly member..             Going to make it short..for now..     2 ISA&amp;#039;s were opened in branch in April - 1 was opened the other wasnt..     A few weeks later, we had a response saying that it was becuase of incorrect details, we then found out the manager had entered the wrong branch sort code. Again, it was nearly May now, and after many in branch visits and calls still not sorted. A complaint was then lodged, along comes May, saying it will be a further month.. More calls and visits, in this time we see a really helpful member of staff in branch and she ended up getting reported  by the other Barclays member of staff at the call centre!    Along came June, and a letter saying there not in any position to respond...  More calls ...  Along comes July... not even a date when they would be replying..and no more luck in branch or on the phone..        We have been a member of Barclays for over  30  years and have never had an problems....     So basically at the end of the day... money sitting in an account doing nothing.. and not even a glimmer of any backdated interest etc
