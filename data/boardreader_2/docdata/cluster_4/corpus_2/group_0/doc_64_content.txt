Further information about the status of your application will be mailed to you in 10-14 business days. You can also visit our website to check the status at: www.myapplicationstatus.com/barclays.     I probably shoulda waited for the invite from Bean.... shoulda had Bob do a poll - apply now or wait.        Keep in mind that even the most esteemed of the CW&amp;#039;s and CP&amp;#039;s got that notice when we had pulled the trigger on Ameriprise...     Yes, i recall. And i also got it on my usair, so i know there is hope. I&amp;#039;ve been checking for updates hourly - so far, nothing.   It may be a first day ramp-up problem too. ETA: waiting for the invite would probably eliminate the ramp-up problems - they won&amp;#039;t go out for a few more days.
