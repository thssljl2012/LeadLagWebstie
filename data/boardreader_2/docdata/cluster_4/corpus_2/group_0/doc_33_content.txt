 But there is a cost in loading the card. From Barclay&amp;#039;s FAQs:    If you use a Barclays debit card to pay for your order (i.e. when you put money on the card) you will not be charged a fee. The cash advance fee charged by credit card providers and other debit card providers will vary.    So for Amex or any other card the transaction will be a cash advance - thus rendering the plan an expensive way of shuffling your money around and not generating any miles or qualifying spend.
