  Hi,  I was wondering if any of you could give me some advice here. I opened a young persons account a month ago with Barclays, and told that within 5 working days I&amp;#039;d have both my card and PIN. But now, a month later, and after numerous telephone calls and 5 visits to the branch, my new card still hasn&amp;#039;t even been ordered.    When I go to the branch, the personal banker or supervisor always seems to be somewhere else, and I can&amp;#039;t make an appointment to talk to her. The cashiers always tell me that they&amp;#039;ll tell someone to order a card, but this still hasn&amp;#039;t happened.    Then last week, I went in and was told it had to be ordered over the phone. I&amp;#039;ve tried every Barclays phone number, and I&amp;#039;m either told to go back to the branch, or that my account cannot be accessed because I haven&amp;#039;t used my card yet (how can I use it?  )    Does anyone know who I can go to next?
