I seem to be able to stick my UK debit card in any cash machine in the US and have never had any problems.  Is that because it&amp;#039;s a Barclays Connect (Visa Delta) card?                        You can use any card but the exchange rate and transaction charges will vary.   I used my Wells Fargo card in a Wachovia ATM on Sunday and got stung for a $3 transaction charge and WF will charge me as well.   There&amp;#039;s always someone with their hand in your pocket here
