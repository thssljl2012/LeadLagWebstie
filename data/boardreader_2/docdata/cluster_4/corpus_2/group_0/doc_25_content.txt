  What is the best way to insure an iPhone if I bought it off e-bay? All the insurers I looked at say you can&amp;#039;t have bought it off an aucton. The only way I have found so far would be to upgrade my bank account to a Barclays Additions account and then pay 14 but that seems expensive.    Thanks!
