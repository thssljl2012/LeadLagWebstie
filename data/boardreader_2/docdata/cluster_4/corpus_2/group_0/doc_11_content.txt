I received the three obligatory &amp;#039;knock back&amp;#039; letters from the bank and in March 2008 sent the lot with their complaint form to the FSO.     The complaint refers to a loan of 10000 (rising to over 14000 with costs) and a 3300 payment for PPI.     As expected I had a number of letters from the FOS to say that hey were very busy and not in a posiion allocate an adjudicator. The last of these letters was on 30 May 2008. But surprisingly on 9 June, I had another letter from the FOS say that they had upheld the complaint and Barclays had agreed to pay redress plus the interest and recalculate the loan as had i not taken out the PPI in the first place.     So in about 10 days at the start of June the FOS had allocated an adjudicator, investigated the complaint, spoken to Barclays and written back to me. Amazing.     Last Thursday I had a call from Barclays to say that they were putting my loan repayments on hold. !?!     I rang the Barclays Customer Relations number i found on google to try and get an idea of timescales of when i would be recompensed. They couldn&amp;#039;t tell me because they said that they needed to work out how much to take off the loan. i asked that the money be sent direct to me and not charged to the loan account. I asked that they write to me to confirm that that is what they would be doing.     I wasn&amp;#039;t left feeling very confident though as the people in the Barclays call centre (Liverpool/Merseyside by their accents) did not seem at all sure of what they were talking about.     I read earlier that they have 28 days to refund monies, is that correct?     I am assuming i am within my rights to request that the lump sum is sent direct or at least deposited in my bank account.                         I spoke again to Barclays customer relations this afternoon. they insist that it is Barclays policy to repay monies owing direct to the loan account and not into a current account. I couldn&amp;#039;t quite follow the argument why this should happen. I didn&amp;#039;t have the letter from the FOS in front of me to push the point . Barclays could not give me any sort of timescale either on when this will happen. I have left a message on the call box of the adjudicator at the FOS to try and clarify this point and hopefully apply pressure to the bank.
