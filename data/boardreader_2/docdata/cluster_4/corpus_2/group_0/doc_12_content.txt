 Based upon the fact that you got Platinum cards with $3-4,000 credit limits, I offer the following.  You applied for the premium cards but did not qualify.  The terms and conditions of these cards, and most cards, is that if you don&amp;#039;t apply for the premium card, you will be considered for a lower level card.  This is probably what happened to you.  My guess is that your credit score did not warrant the premium card.  Do you know your FICO score?  My suggestion, keep the cards, and when you can qualify for the premium cards, apply and get the bonus from those cards (but you did not mention anything about bonus miles, did you get bonus miles?    Barclays application note is below:     In certain instances, we may be unable to open an account for you, or you may receive a Platinum card with a credit line of less than $5,000. World benefits vary from Platinum benefits. Please review the Terms &amp;amp;amp; Conditions and the materials provided with your Cardmember Agreement for details.     I found another note on the Barclays site:   For the $79 Annual Fee Premier World MasterCard: $79  For the $49 Annual Fee World MasterCard: $49  For the $0 Annual Fee World MasterCard or the Platinum MasterCard: $0     Since the World MasterCard gets 1 mile for every $2 spending, I think?? the Platinum card gets similar credit.   But call and check about the mileage accrual for spending.  But since spending is a lousy way to get miles from USairways, I suggest that you get the miles from USairways credit card applications/approval.  My two cents.
