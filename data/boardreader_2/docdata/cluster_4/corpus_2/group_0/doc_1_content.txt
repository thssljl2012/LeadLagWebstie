 If loading one of these cards wasn&amp;#039;t treated as a cash withdrawl by the credit card companies, it could turn ANY credit card into a 0&amp;amp;#37; APR card (pay off the balance of your card, then transfer it back out onto one of those cards and then back to your current account).           Quote:                         Unfortunately I note the FAQ says:      How do I put more money on my Travel Money Card?   Once you&amp;#039;ve received your card you can spend, top up, spend and top up again as often as you like while you&amp;amp;#8217;re away, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year from anywhere there&amp;amp;#8217;s a phone connection. All you&amp;amp;#8217;ll need to remember is your PIN, the phone number you registered with us and your date of birth (for security purposes). You&amp;#039;ll also need to have your UK debit card or credit card to pay for the top-up&amp;amp;#8224;.      &amp;amp;#8224; If you use a Barclays debit card to pay for your order you will not be charged a fee.  The cash advance fee charged by credit card providers and other debit card providers will vary.
