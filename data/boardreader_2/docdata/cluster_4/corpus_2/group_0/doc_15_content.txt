well ive just joined barclays last week and so far ive found them absolutly amazing! they have handled evrything so quickly and been really helpfull, i just came from royal bank of scotland... word of warning... do NOT go with them, they are a terrible bank, the charges are through the roof and the debit cards are not visa so its impossible to use your card at a load of places, can&amp;amp;#039;t you just change your account at barclays? it would be a lot easier, just go into your nearest branch and say i&amp;amp;#039;d like to just open a no  charge current account for my wages to get paid into.
