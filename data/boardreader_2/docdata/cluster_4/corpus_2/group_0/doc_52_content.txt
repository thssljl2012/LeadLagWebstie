Yes, thats how i did it and it should go through as a fast payment so no loss of interest waiting for a bacs payment to clear       This will work with all other banks, just use the pay a bill or someone facility in online banking and remember if you ask a member of barclays staff if this can be done they will say No as they can&amp;#039;t monitor if you have breached your annual limit but as i have proven it is 100% possible! - A nice way of escaping call charges or a visit to a barclays branch or the wait for a cheque to clear!
