I was told I could view it via internet banking when I opened it but an earlier post on this thread said that&amp;#039;s not possible unless you also have a current account.       I&amp;#039;m paying in monthly by standing order and so I&amp;#039;d like to know how fast the interest is accuring- the question is, how do I check my balance and access the money? What would I need to take the branch to do either of these things- a letter or bank statement? Can I access it by internet banking?                      We are in the same position as you - no other account with Barclays and it is not possible to view it on line.  Go into the branch, make sure you have your ISA account number and sort code, then ask branch staff to give you a print out.  We have done this a couple of times already.  You will get an &amp;amp;quot;Entries Report&amp;amp;quot; with details of receipts and a balance.
