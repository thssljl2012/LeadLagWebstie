  You mean that you can&amp;#039;t just use any debit card from a US-based bank account in ANY cash machines in the UK?        I seem to be able to stick my UK debit card in any cash machine in the US and have never had any problems.  Is that because it&amp;#039;s a Barclays Connect (Visa Delta) card?
