  Hello to everyone and thankyou in advance for your replies.     I paid 490 in cash into my local barclays branch on Monday, at 12.10pm.     I deposited it in the drop deposit box as the Q was massive.  I kept my tear off slip portion of the envelope and everything was filled out correctly, including the paying in slip.     Come 7pm the same eve i checked my online statement, and the money hadn&amp;#039;t gone in. I rang the 0845 number to speak to someone and they informend me that nothing was showing at all.     The next day my rent came out along with me tv licence (i dont have an overdraft).     After speaking to the branch i paid it into, they checked all the envelopes for one matching the serial number i have on my tear off slip, but couldnt find it, so told me it must be stuck in the machine somewhere and that i had to wait till friday (tomorrow) for an engineer to come out and look.     A moment ago i got a call from the assistant manager, informing me the engineer had been and that my envelope was not in the machine.  He then proceeded to ask me what i was wearing that day etc, i presume to check cctv.     As it stands, i have 490 missing in barclays somewhere (or as i think in a member of the staffs pocket) i am 450 overdrawn, without an overdraft limit.  I have had 2 30 charges put on (today and yesterday) due to going overdrawn.     I am so stuck and i dont know what to do!!  Can anyone help, does anyone know where i stand on this matter????
