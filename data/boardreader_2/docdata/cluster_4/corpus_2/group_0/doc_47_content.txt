Branch staff v unhelpful, my fault they can&amp;#039;t help as because I wrote and complained it&amp;#039;s now out of their hands - silly me!  When I mentioned that some branches had made compensation I got the same response.  Told them that was abdicating their responsibility and if they didn&amp;#039;t take responsibility I&amp;#039;d be outside every Sat a.m. handing out paper to say don&amp;#039;t invest in this ISA.  They said they&amp;#039;d call the police if I did, I pointed out I wouldn&amp;#039;t be obstructing anyone, pavement is public area, just the same as guys who hand out mobile phone leaflets.  They were so damm rude that as I was leaving I decided to do my best teaching voice and announced, to a packed bank of people waiting to go in to see advisors, that if anyone was thinking of opening a Tax Haven ISA they should check out this site, etc.  Total meltdown of staff, one ran out to get police, one practically died of embarrassment.  I on the other hand, had a whale of a time.  Best five mins of my involvement with Barclays!  Hey ho, Financial Ombudsman beckons .......                                           Wish I&amp;#039;d been there, would have loved to see it!
