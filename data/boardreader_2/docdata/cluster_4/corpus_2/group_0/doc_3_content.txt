However i have tried to contact our new one and her area manager but with no success. Maybe because the message left was regrading a complaint over my parents account.      Does anyone know who i have to esculate this to further above the area manager     thanks  will                      just call customer services ask them to log a complaint and get ref number.  no point calling area manager as they dont deal with customers - they manage teams of business managers.    if it is your parents acc. they should be logging a complaint not you.    i work for b/lays
