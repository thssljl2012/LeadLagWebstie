 Part of your score is determined by how much of your available credit you are using. This is called &amp;amp;quot;utilization&amp;amp;quot;.  Lower utilization is better for your score.       Let&amp;#039;s say your total credit card limits are $5,000. If you owe $500 when your credit card issuer reports your balance, your utilization is 10%.       It&amp;#039;s important to note that even if you pay your card in full every month, a balance could still be reported. Let&amp;#039;s say your payment is due on the 20th, and your issuer reports your balance on the 15th. If you pay your $500 balance in full on the 18th, a balance of $500 would have already been reported.       So my question is, is it possible you had more charges last month than you usually do, even if you always pay your balance in full?      Another thought is - did you shop other insurance companies before you switched to AIG? Those other companies might have put an inquiry on your record.
