                                                         This is a sneaky, underhand way for Barclays to still commit daylight robbery on their customers no matter what the High Court decides on charges.     This is gift-wrapped as a favour, but what it actually means is that Barclays will still be rolling in it even if the OFT rules that bank charges are excessive and illegal. This is because by introducing this personal reserve, they can argue that they gave all their customers the option to opt out of this &amp;#039;service&amp;#039; and that it&amp;#039;s a FEE for a service rather than a PENALTY.     As soon as the High Court rules bank charges are illegal, all people who have opted out of the Personal Reserve will be better off. People who have opted in will be just as badly off as they were before.      I strongly advise everyone to opt out, the personal reserve is a very clever way of them still imposing unauthorised overdraft fees, just under a different name.     As soon as I got my letter I wrote back, and emailed back, and rang them. They can easily claim they didn&amp;#039;t receive your slip in the post, so I would recommend this.     Barclays are absolute cowboys! If I didn&amp;#039;t owe them so much I would be leaving immediately.
