  Hi all,  I have just received my Barclays Credit Card with 14 months 0% balance transfer deal. I have checked with them and it&amp;#039;s confirmed that it is not possible to transfer the balance to current account   is there any work around for this? (Like transfering the balance to my Halifax credit card and withdraw cash?)    Thanks  B
