So, it&amp;#039;s YMMV - no set rules...    i don&amp;#039;t think ameriprise is counted - biz cards apparently aren&amp;#039;t either as she didn&amp;#039;t mention that acct, just the personal ones.  But i also think that its more than just a flat % - internal history and overall credit history should factor in. I have somewhat high utility (30K, 16%) - i know some of your guys who got high limits during junami had lower utility.      According to the csr(supervisor) it is counted. She told me that was why I was approved for the lower limit and I was able to reallocate from another Barclays card to ameriprise. This was before the &amp;amp;quot;transfer&amp;amp;quot; to the ameriprise service...        This post has been edited by  TrevorHere : Jul 1 2008, 06:55 PM
