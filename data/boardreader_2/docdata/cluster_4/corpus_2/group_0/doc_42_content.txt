  However responsible one maybe with one&amp;#039;s account, it is the error&amp;#039;s by the bank (and Barclays do error) that can cause the account to be overdrawn. Barclays are not good at correcting their errors and for this reason this scheme terrifies me. Before there was a cut off that stopped the account when thing went wrong. Now things will escalate and make matters worse. It took me 3 months to get Barclays to admit that they were paying someone else&amp;#039;s direct debit out of my account. If I go over my overdraft limit, I want the bank to stop payments, not continue and make matters worse.
