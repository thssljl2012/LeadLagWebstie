      Mother has a Barclays current account, simple one you know, no overdraft limit.   But, today they have sent a letter introducing a RESERVE service, for emergencies which allows you to get    150 in the red.   .   For this service they charge 22 for every five days you dip into it.    They say in the letter it is  not  an overdraft.      The opt-out letter is now in the post, thankyou Mr Barclays
