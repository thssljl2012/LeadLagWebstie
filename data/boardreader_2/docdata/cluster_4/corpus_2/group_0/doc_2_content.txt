  I&amp;#039;m not going to say Indian because it might not have been India, but I have just had some travel plans totally messed up by a guy in a Barclays call centre.    I need a Visa Electron card in order to avoid paying Ryanair card payment charges (see other threads on this). I knew I had an old Barclays account which used to have an Electron card with it. The card has long disappeared though so I called them up to ask for a new one. I asked the guy on the phone, &amp;amp;quot;will it definitely be the same as my old card, will it be a Visa Electron?&amp;amp;quot; and he assured me that it would.    Today the card arrives and it is a Visa Connect card, utterly useless to me. I call them up and get through to an English guy who tells me that my card had been &amp;amp;quot;upgraded for my benefit&amp;amp;quot; and that if I want to downgrade I will have to go to a branch. In the meantime the offer I was hoping to get with Ryanair is slipping from my grasp. You would think the people in the call centres would at least know the diference between one kind of card and another.    Rant over.
