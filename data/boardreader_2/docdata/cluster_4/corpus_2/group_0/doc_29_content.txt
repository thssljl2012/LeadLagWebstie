  If they haven&amp;#039;t satifactorily worked out the figures and / or you want the money repaid to you rather than off your loan, get back in touch with your adjudicator at the FOS - email should be fine - and get them to put pressure on Barclays    Hi Tiggrae,     I have not sent any paper work to F.O.S. was not too sure now to do that, still a bit of a newbie,     Do i just send all the paper work to them with a covering letter     Thanks   Hash
