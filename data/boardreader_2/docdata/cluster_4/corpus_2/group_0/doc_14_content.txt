Barclays could not give me any sort of timescale either on when this will happen. I have left a message on the call box of the adjudicator at the FOS to try and clarify this point and hopefully apply pressure to the bank.                      If you&amp;#039;ve been unlawfully deprived of monies, the monies should be paid back to you in the amount + interest of what you&amp;#039;ve paid and the remainder of the ppi payments removed from the loan- Re-read what the FOS said in their letter to you, did you stipulate on your complaint form to them how you wanted them to put things right - what exactly did you sign for on the FOS acceptance form
