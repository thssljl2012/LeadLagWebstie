I did contemplate it but didn&amp;#039;t bother in the end.  Seems I should have done, at least I could have got a kick-start.  I&amp;#039;ll probably be over there in 4-6 weeks, so too late now.      I plan to do the secured credit card thing, whilst leaving some dosh in my Barclays account here to draw on when I am close to 50% on the card.      My UK card issuer says I will need to close the account when I leave for good as they don&amp;#039;t like you living abroad with a UK CC account.  So I&amp;#039;m just not gonna tell them for a few months after I move and just keep paying the bills by online banking.  I&amp;#039;m sure they will figure it out when I have been buying stuff over here for a few months anyway, I suppose they might even block the card.      One thing fatbrit says which worries me: If it&amp;#039;s best not to use your card for online purchases, what else do you use to buy stuff on the interweb?  I don&amp;#039;t want to be restricted to Best Buy and Circuit City for my technology purchases!                        Are you not transferring the money over? Why would you need to draw on your Barclays account?      A lot of credit card companies don&amp;#039;t like you leaving the UK. I just never told them and left my address as my parents house. I only use them when I go back to the UK. If you use it a lot in the US they will probably eventually realise you are not in the UK anymore.      I think he is talking about the secured credit card. Basically as he said don&amp;#039;t see it as a credit card - its just something you have to do to get credit. I wouldn&amp;#039;t even go above 30% on it, but to be honest it probably won&amp;#039;t make a big difference to your score you get after about 6 months.      Actually just read it again - he seems to mention it to relation to a subscription. Personally if its something you want to subscribe to for the forseeable future this isn&amp;#039;t a bad thing - a lot of people who are building credit do this as a way of using the credit card monthly without having the temptation of spending big money on it - they just put the card in a drawer and let the subscription do its work. Although these are probably people who have had credit card issues in the past.
