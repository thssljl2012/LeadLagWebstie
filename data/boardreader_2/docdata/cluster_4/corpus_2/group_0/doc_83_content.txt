        QUOTE (council dweller &amp;amp;#064; Jul 7 2008, 01&amp;amp;#58;59 PM)       22 quid for 5 days &amp;#039;interest&amp;#039; on a 150 quid loan .....the kind of business done by those men who break things if you can&amp;#039;t pay. Usually fingers. Says a lot about Barclays and the state of the economy.     22 on 150 is 14.7% and this is for 5 days  To find the annualised rate we need to take the Percentage rate of 14.7 divide by 100 and then plus 1 = 1.147  As there are 73 five day periods in a year we then need to take 1.147 and take it to the 73 power  1.147^ 73 = 22,291  Take 22,291 less 1 and X 100 = 2,229,000% APR  Nasty
