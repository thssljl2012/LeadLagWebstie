  My PPI claim with Barclays went in a while back.     Since then, I&amp;#039;ve had two follow up letters saying they would get back to me by certain dates - Now I&amp;#039;ve had a letter saying that they can&amp;#039;t give me a full response at the moment, but are still looking into it.     Does it usually take this long?
