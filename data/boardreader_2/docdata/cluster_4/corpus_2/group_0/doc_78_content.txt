        QUOTE (Ologhai Jones &amp;amp;#064; Jul 8 2008, 08&amp;amp;#58;33 AM)       I can see why some may be irked with Barclays in principle for this, but surely there&amp;#039;s no need for the financially literate (and careful) to actually opt out, is there?     Did anyone have an answer to this question?
