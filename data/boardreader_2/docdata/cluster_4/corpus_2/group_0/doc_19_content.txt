 My darling husband has a juniper card. We will pay it off and cancel it. They are just too much drama and grief.      We have used bill-me-later for 3 purchases.  They give you 90 days to pay in full and avoid interest. If you cannot pay in full, they act like &amp;#039;layaway&amp;#039; and you pay month-to-month with interest applied.      We are happy with bill-me-later.  Very very disgusted with juniper[barclays]
