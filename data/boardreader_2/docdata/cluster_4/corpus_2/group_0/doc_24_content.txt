This means you have to supply a password when using a card online aswell, the idea of this is to make it safer, but in reality its switching the owness/ liability from the banks back to the cardholder. From seeing how some of these so called massive banking institutes have implemented this IT wise, i certainly wont be banking with some of them.                      And Chip &amp;amp;amp; Pin fraud is on the increase as well. Chip &amp;amp;amp; Pin readers in most stores can be hacked quite easily - it&amp;#039;s been proven to be possible with nothing more sophisticated than a pin/piece of wire and a laptop to record the transactions which are communicated in the clear inside the Chip &amp;amp;amp; Pin device. Yep, the banks were too cheap to implement encrypted transactions which would have protected the consumer but they made sure their cryptographic keys were well protected inside the device. The onus is now on the consumer to prove they had their card cloned by a Chip &amp;amp;amp; Pin device, something the banks will typically claim is impossible (it&amp;#039;s soooo not). :(      I suspect the only real solution to online -and even in-store - fraud might be the use of SecurID/RSA hardware type-tokens which would authenticate the card holder beyond all reasonable doubt. These aren&amp;#039;t cheap, but they would make it nigh on impossible for fraudulent transactions to take place online. If all the major banks implemented such technology the price would drop through the floor. A single token could even be made to work for multiple cards, or why not have the &amp;amp;quot;security token&amp;amp;quot; application downloaded to your mobile phone where it could be configured with an SMS code from your bank etc... Wasn&amp;#039;t one of the banks looking into providing security tokens to it&amp;#039;s customers for online transactions... was it Barclays? It all costs of course - but then real security always does.
