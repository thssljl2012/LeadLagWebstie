The DD provider represents the DD so that could be another 40 in less than a week.   The DD provider also makes an additional charge for the payment being returned(the unknown factor).    IF i had the option and I do not bank at Barclays, I would be wary of OPTING OUT unless I was 100% or as good as that I would NEVER have this issue of returned payments.        We will have this scenario come August/September on the boards from people who have vociferously stated it was a scam and they opted out.                      Most people, I think, do have some sort of agreed overdraft on their accounts.  That is the buffer I use if I go a little over in any one month.  I don&amp;#039;t believe I have referred to this reserve as a &amp;#039;scam&amp;#039; merely that I - and others - object to having to opt out rather than in.  And I do believe that this is an attempt by Barclays to make more revenue in charges from the unwary.
