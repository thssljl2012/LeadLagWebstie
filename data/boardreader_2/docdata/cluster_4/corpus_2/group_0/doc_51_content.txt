  Crumbs, I was on the verge of apply for one of these, but after reading this I&amp;#039;ll look at other options. As a Barclays current a/c customer (though not for much longer!) I&amp;#039;ve had consistently appalling customer service from them, so this doesn&amp;#039;t surprise me at all.    I would encourage people to go ahead and complain to the ombudsman, but the one time I had to do that (not Barclays-related!) the ombudsman still hadn&amp;#039;t got to my complaint after six months, by which time the issue had finally been resolved.
