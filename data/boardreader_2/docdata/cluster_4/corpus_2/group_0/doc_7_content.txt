Don&amp;#039;t worry it all takes time to sort out and problems always come in multiples         Anyway the wording on my printouts I am confused about and not sure if its something I can or can&amp;#039;t claim are:     Firstly there is a pile of paperwork for each account that has &amp;amp;quot;View Statement Entries&amp;amp;quot; as a title and wording as follows on it:     CHG - O/Draft Interest  Sheet No 10     You cannot claim this       CHG - O/Draft Excess Fee  Sheet No 14     you CAN claim this      CHG - Unpaid D/D  Sheet No 14     you CAN claim this      CHG - O/Draft Interest  Sheet no 16     You cannot claim this         After that there follows another lot of paper for each account with what I think is a simplified statement it&amp;#039;s headings read as follows:     Date Activity Paid out Paid in Balance     Next there are what appears to be photocopied bank statements:     Date Particulars Payments Receipts Balance Ref  DEB  DEP  PAY  CHQ                 These following ones apply to a business bank account with Lloyds TSB.     CHG - Charges 10apr to 9may  dr  CHG - Serrvice Charge     cannot claim      CHG - FEE-  unpaid items     CAN claim      CHG - Bus Focus Fee VAT paid 1jun to 30jun     not sure about this one      Account Charge     cannot claim                Buisness claims are still progressing as they are not covered by the test case so cliam for everything that isn&amp;#039;t a monthy charge for running the account such as Account Charge and overdraft interest ie; claim for unpaid DD fees, Unpaid SO fees, Paid item fees, and overdraft excess fees.              same charges are applicable for personal accounts reclaiming!         Just to put you in the picture although a couple of pages are like ordinary bank statements the majority of them (and as I am claiming for 4 accounts backdated 6 years thats quite a lot of paper) are printouts headed &amp;amp;quot;CUSTOMER NOTES&amp;amp;quot; in collumns on blank sheets of paper. Basically each new item has a date and the info jargon next to it with some numbers. I am assuming this lot is a load of internal account info about activity of the account and so I can ignore it, none of it actually has any amounts on it.        Sorry if I seem stupid and maybe the answers are glaringly obvious but I cannot grasp what I am doing. I dont want to end up asking them to pay back more or less than what I am owed as either they will chase me for debt if overpaid or they will not admit they underpaid if I am correct??         Don&amp;#039;t worry about asking questions everyone of us started with questions and received answers that have helped us NO question is stupid if you don&amp;#039;t know the answer         Finally is there anything else I can claim for that wont be written on the statements?     I assume I then add it all up (once I get to grips with it) and send it in with letter number 2 - sit back and wait?         Once you have sifted through all the paper work put all the figures into one of the spread sheets available on the site ( I used Mindazi&amp;#039;s ( think it was from MSE) ) and see what it adds up to and then make a decision as to weather you are going to claim CCI or not.          Theres lots of info on here and on CAG so have a good read before yoiu decide.          What ever you decide make sure you use the templates and stick to YOUR timetable and not theirs.            Many thanks, sorry to ramble.     H                           Hope the answers above are helpful and if you have any other questions don&amp;#039;t hesitate to ask.              Please remember the advice I give is not financial or legal but just from personal experience and what I have learnt from the reclaiming forums so if anyone see any mistake in my advice please let me know
