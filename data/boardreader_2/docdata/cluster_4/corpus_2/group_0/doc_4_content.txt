He had called his cc company to put a stop on the card and had called the police who said that they don&amp;#039;t investigate these things (he had the theifs address etc) because the cc companys fraud department would, which they did not.  Anyway, we didn&amp;#039;t send the order and everything worked out ok for us, payment was recalled, no goods lost.       So today we have another payment in excess of 300.00 with a similar postcode (different billing, shipping and card holder addresses) and the same email address but commiting fraud with a different name and a different card, a barclay card...called barclays right away so that we could ask thm to inform their customer that someone is using their card to commit fraud...spent 3 hours on the phone being passed from person to person, department to department and not a single person knew what to do or how to help...what?!!!  What if it was me, my card and someone was trying to help and stop fraud?  Oh dear Barclays!       Barclays didn&amp;#039;t care, Visa didn&amp;#039;t care, Police didn&amp;#039;t care, our payment processor Protx didn&amp;#039;t care (actually said that our customer who is experiencing the fraud needs to contact their card issuer, how are they supposed to do that when they don&amp;#039;t know)  Who do I call or speak to?  Who cares about fraud apart from the consumer?  Anyone?  Anyone at all?                        That&amp;#039;s shocking they don&amp;#039;t want to help, especially Barclays, wont their fraud dept get on the case? Ask to speak to them directly.    They really ought to pool this information between them, it does sound like one person trying their luck with many different cards. There doesn&amp;#039;t seem to be much come back to robbing 1000&amp;#039;s of pounds from companies in other peoples names.    Good on you for trying to do something about it!  I don&amp;#039;t know if its worth trying to contact CIFAS or Experian  or the like?
