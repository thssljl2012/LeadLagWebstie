  The terms and conditions do not say what will be charged if you opt-out and then overdraw, or draw a transaction over your overdraft limit. I assume you will simply not be allowed to overdraw.  It does say you will be charged 8 per transaction (so if you have a busy account 3 or more transactions will cost more than 22. I have  never  overdrawn since the 1970&amp;#039;s when  one  cheque went astray, I went less than 100 over, but the Barclays bank manager had me in his office for a lecture! (Those were the days) So why have they offered me 1000 reserve if I never use it?   I will not use it so it&amp;#039;s irrelevant whether to opt-out or not, but I am surprised  Martin  has not advised one way or the other. It&amp;#039;s his favourite subject after all!
