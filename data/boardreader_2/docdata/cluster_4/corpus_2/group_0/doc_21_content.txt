        QUOTE (cocomad &amp;amp;#064; Jun 30 2008, 01&amp;amp;#58;36 PM)         DH&amp;#039;s LL Beans was with BofA&amp;amp;#33; Shame they had to change banks and go to Barclay&amp;#039;s&amp;amp;#33;      I don&amp;#039;t mind the changing, its who they changed to. I think i would get decent limits at most banks... but Juny has pulled the sufficient credit BS too often. I wonder how long they will put up with complaints from customers for declined for sufficient credit or for low limit cards? Or their infamous CLD/closures after issuing the cards?   I also wonder if current cardholders will get preapproved invites...
