The FOS don&amp;#039;t make themselves crystal clear on this issue and i didn&amp;#039;t specify how i wanted monies repaid on the original FOS complaints form.     This is what the FOS wrote:       Having carefully considered the merits of your complaint, we contacted the business explaining that in out view the complaint should be upheld. We recommend that the business should pay redress with the intention of putting you closely as is practical in the position you would have been in had the PPI policy not been sold. In order to do this we recommend that the business should:         1. re-arrange your loan by writing off all amounts outstanding in respect of the borrowing for the PPI premium, including any interests and charges, so that in future the number and level of outstanding repayments against the loan are the same as would now have applied had you taken the loan sum without the PPI cover;         2. calculate the amount you paid up to the time of settlement in respect of the additional borrowing for the PPI premium, including interest charged, add interest on each of the additional payments made for this at the rate of 8&amp;amp;#37; per anum simple from the date of each payment was made to the date of cancellation is paid less any premium refund actually paid to you on cancellation of the policy;         3. pay you the amount calculated in 2. along with a note showing how the amount concerned was calculated.         I am pleased to confirm that the business has accepted our view on your case and accordingly, it has offered to calculate redress in line with the method set out above.         I trust you will be prepared to to accept the offer made by the business........       The settlement form was very simple, it asked me to confirm my acceptance of the offer by Barclays in full and final settlement of my complaint. Unfortunately at the time of signing in mid June it wasn&amp;#039;t clear as ro how redress would be paid.                      I think it&amp;#039;s fairly clear in point 3 when it says &amp;#039;pay YOU the amount calculated in 2 - inequivical - go back and tell Barclays they&amp;#039;re in breach of the agreement you signed with the FOS - email your adjudicator and tell him / her you signed on the understanding the money would be paid back to you - it&amp;#039;s NOT for Barclays to decide !!!!
