  I&amp;#039;m still undecided about this - I only use my Barclays current account to pay a couple of bills, but keep it as I&amp;#039;ve had it for 20 years or so (useful when applying for other accounts).    Mods/Admins - Any chance of Martin giving us his opinion on this ?  Time is running out to &amp;#039;opt out&amp;#039; !
