They beat my BofA by 1.5k   Now, question is, will they let me keep it?     ETA:  will update creditpulls when I see who they pulled tomorrow - already did my pulls for the day.     Did they pull TU? What&amp;#039;s your score on TU?      Don&amp;#039;t know yet who they pulled (I applied after I did my daily updates) - probably TU,  FICO 771, PFICO 712.  One TU inq showing.  18% overall util.  Maybe using the evite helped, if they give brownie points for longevity (almost 10 years with the former Bean card), but probably not.  Still waiting to see if they let me keep it.     (I avoided Junami; this is my first Barclays card.)
