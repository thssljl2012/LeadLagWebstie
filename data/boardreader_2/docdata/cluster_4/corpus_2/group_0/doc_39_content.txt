        QUOTE (notanewmember &amp;amp;#064; Jul 7 2008, 01&amp;amp;#58;48 PM)       Mother has a Barclays current account, simple one you know, no overdraft limit.   But, today they have sent a letter introducing a RESERVE service, for emergencies which allows you to get    150 in the red.   .   For this service they charge 22 for every five days you dip into it.    They say in the letter it is  not  an overdraft.      The opt-out letter is now in the post, thankyou Mr Barclays        22 quid for 5 days &amp;#039;interest&amp;#039; on a 150 quid loan .....the kind of business done by those men who break things if you can&amp;#039;t pay. Usually fingers. Says a lot about Barclays and the state of the economy.
