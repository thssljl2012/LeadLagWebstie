If they don&amp;#039;t reverse it for you, though, chalk it up to being a lesson learned: pay the bill   before   the date that it is due. Trying to pay 2 hours before the cut-off time seems a little close....     It absolutely was close and totally my fault, but most prime banks will remove one late fee a year, I believe.    Thus the point I am always screaming....Barclays/Juniper is Sub-prime.     Completely agree, I so regret having that card on my report.     I like high limits and cashback and airport lounge access.     and a sub-prime card
