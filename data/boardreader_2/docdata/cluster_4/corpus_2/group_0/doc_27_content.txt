They were of no help to me really, in fact they shunned the idea. They say in their letter that there is confusion to who actually sold the policy. I wanted them to find out for sure but they can&amp;#039;t.     I cannot be bothered to do all this again to be told by them &amp;amp;quot;sorry cannot help&amp;amp;quot;. I am literally exhausted with all this. I have lost weight (sat at the computer), neglected my family and my nerves are in tatters.                      send it all to me then, I&amp;#039;ll do it for you !!
