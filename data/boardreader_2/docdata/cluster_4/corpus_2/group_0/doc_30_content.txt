There is also the wage thing that i feel is something that maybe illegal by them. I will be back later as i have to go out now but thanks for the offer and i will take it up after hearing from Freedom.                      I only thing I could do is redo your complaint on the early redemption, I&amp;#039;d make it against Barclays t/a Firstplus and from the 2003 date- as for the mis selling - leave that one for you as you&amp;#039;re on a personal mission !!!
