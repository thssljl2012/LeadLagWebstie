If so, I would have thought that if (hypothetically) I owed Barclays 10k and HSBC 10k and was giving them both 30 each per month on a DMP and I came across 7k which Barclays were prepared to accept as an F&amp;amp;amp;F, what would happen if HSBC found out about this, as in the (large) Barclays debt disappeared from the IE sheet? My assumption is that it would be very difficult to get HSBC to accept a token payment and they would probably take action to get the lot back.   I&amp;#039;m not sure how CCCS do it, but yes - when you do a review of a DMP, you review and resubmit the whole thing: you re-calculate all the I&amp;amp;amp;E figures, and re-calculate the offers based on the remaining outstanding balances.  I must say that in six years of doing reviews, I&amp;#039;ve never had the creditors query any obvious &amp;amp;quot;discrepancies&amp;amp;quot;.  Although I enclose a covering letter highlighting the main reason(s) for any significant increase or decrease in the level of offers, all they really seem bothered about is getting regular payments.
