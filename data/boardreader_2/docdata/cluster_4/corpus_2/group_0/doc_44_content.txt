As a Barclays current a/c customer (though not for much longer!) I&amp;#039;ve had consistently appalling customer service from them, so this doesn&amp;#039;t surprise me at all.     I would encourage people to go ahead and complain to the ombudsman, but the one time I had to do that (not Barclays-related!) the ombudsman still hadn&amp;#039;t got to my complaint after six months, by which time the issue had finally been resolved.                      To be fair, I have opened an account recently, and it was all set up well within 2 weeks.      I just called to confirm that my deposits via online transfer from my BoS current account have gone through alright. Seems like it&amp;#039;s capable of receiving Fast Payments as well.      A tip for people needing to call the Barclays Savings and ISA Helpline on 0845 6030845, you can use one of the followings: 024 76842100 or the freephone number 0800 0854551.
