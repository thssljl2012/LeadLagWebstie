  I&amp;#039;ve been with barclays insurance for about 3 years and now on cancelling my policy they charge 26 as as cancellation fee. This is due if you cancel anytime after the 14 day cooling off period. Even though its a 12 month contract you still pay the fee beyond this if you cancel.      They told me on the phone the policy is automatically renewed by them every 12 months. In theory you would escape the fee if you cancelled on 1 day a year. Any other day and you pay the fee.     What a rip off.
