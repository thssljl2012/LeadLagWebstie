No, i made the complaint against Firstplus and then when i asked about the barclays thing they said i had to resubmit another complaint and then they said it would have to be after the first was dealt with. They were of no help to me really, in fact they shunned the idea. They say in their letter that there is confusion to who actually sold the policy. I wanted them to find out for sure but they can&amp;#039;t.     I cannot be bothered to do all this again to be told by them &amp;amp;quot;sorry cannot help&amp;amp;quot;. I am literally exhausted with all this. I have lost weight (sat at the computer), neglected my family and my nerves are in tatters.     I will now wait for Freedom to get back with their reply and then i am going to take this to court but not myself as like i say its exhausting me. Going to go to our local help centre on these kinds of things. I just feel annoyed that none of the authorities will help.
