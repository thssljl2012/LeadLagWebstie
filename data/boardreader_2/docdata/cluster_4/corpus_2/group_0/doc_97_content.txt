  There is some missing information in the original posting. Firstly the instructions do not explicitly say what you will be charged if you opt out and then go overdrawn, or exceed your overdraft limit. One has to assume that all your payments will be cancelled at 8 per transaction so it depends on how many transactions are likely to go over. More than 3 and it&amp;#039;s more than the 22, so a &amp;amp;quot;busy&amp;amp;quot; account may benefit from the reserve.  Secondly the Personal reserve is just what it says - Personal.  Mine is 1000, the original poster&amp;#039;s is 150, so presumably they look at your typical balance and transaction size before offering the reserve amount.  It&amp;#039;s a pity that we do not trust banks any more, but I don&amp;#039;t, and I have been with Barclays for almost 40 years. They take longer to clear cheques now than they did when I joined and they had bank messengers with little leather satchels and typed up your account by hand. I shall  opting out simply because I will never use it and as we have been given such short notice, it must presumably be in our favour to opt-out . What a sad state Banks have got into.
