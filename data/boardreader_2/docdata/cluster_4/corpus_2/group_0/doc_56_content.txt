      Ah I see it was introduced in May. Guess the computer trawled through the accounts and gave my mother a  yes          http://www.newsroom.barclays.co.uk/content...mp;NewsAreaID=2    New overdraft service   Personal Reserve is designed to act as a safety net for customers who exceed their agreed overdraft limit if they have one or go overdrawn if they dont . This gives customers the peace of mind that payments will be met, putting the customer in control of their finances.  The launch of Personal Reserve on August 18th will radically change Barclays approach to overdrafts and will differentiate the bank from the rest of the industry by replacing the unauthorised overdraft with a completely new structure. Personal Reserve significantly reduces charges and gives customers certainty about when their payments will be met and when they will be bounced.      For a single flat fee of 22 any customer who uses their Personal Reserve will have access to it for five working days.  During this time a customer can use their Personal Reserve as many times as they wish and provided that they do not go beyond their Personal Reserve amount payments will be honoured.  Individual Personal Reserve amounts will be communicated to eligible customers between June and July. The average Personal Reserve amount will be 250. Customers will only pay for their Personal Reserve if they use it and all existing customers will be given an opportunity to opt out of having a Personal Reserve on their account if they do not want one.
