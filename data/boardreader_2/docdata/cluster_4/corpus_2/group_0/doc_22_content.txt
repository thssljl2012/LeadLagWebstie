I dont want Lloyds, barclays or HSBC due to working for one in the past and having bad experiences with the others!      Over to you to &amp;amp;quot;Spec me a bank&amp;amp;quot;!                      Rubbish.   Maestro is as widely accepted in the US as Visa - I&amp;#039;ve just come back from a business trip and used my Maestro card for more or less everything.   I will agree that in middle-Eastern countries acceptance is lower.   However for main locations around the world Maestro (owned by MasterCard) is every bit as accepted.
