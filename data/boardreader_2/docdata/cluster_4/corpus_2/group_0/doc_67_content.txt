 I know, it&amp;#039;s my own fault for having a crap current account with uncompetitive interest rates. But the least Barclays could do is make up for that by offering good customer service. Instead what I get is...     ...failing to register change of address  twice,  even after I&amp;#039;ve been into the branch... sending my statements and my telephone banking code to complete strangers at my old address... having no access to my bank account for  weeks  because they&amp;#039;ve sent my PIN reader to the wrong address...trying to charge me for a new PIN reader when mine breaks... local branches not open on Saturday mornings... failing to acknowledge my formal complaint (acknowledgement probably got sent to my old address)... trying to sell me mortgage protection insurance when I call to make a formal complaint(!)...     ...all that just within the past 12 months. And I&amp;#039;m not even one of the unfortunate souls who&amp;#039;s applied for an ISA with them.     On the positive side, it&amp;#039;s finally motivated me to go and open a decent account with competitive interest rates and close the accounts I&amp;#039;ve had with Barclays for 17 years. Good riddance to a dreadful bank.
