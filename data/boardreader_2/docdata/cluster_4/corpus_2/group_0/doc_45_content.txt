With my Tax Haven ISA last year i would always ring the expensive savings and investments phone line, however this year i transfer money from my Barclays current account to HSBC (Using fast payments) and then immediately transfer the money into my ISA - I&amp;#039;m a student so can&amp;#039;t afford to pay the full 3600 in at once! So transfers can be made into the ISA from other banks, if you ask Barclays staff they will tell you that this is not possible, however i can confirm from personal experience that this does work!    Hope this helps  Rob                      How did you do it? Just using Pay a family, friend option when in HSBC bit?
