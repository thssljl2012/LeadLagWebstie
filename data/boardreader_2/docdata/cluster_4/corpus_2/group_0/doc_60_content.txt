I seem to be able to stick my UK debit card in any cash machine in the US and have never had any problems.  Is that because it&amp;#039;s a Barclays Connect (Visa Delta) card?                        Of course you can Visa, Mastercard etc are all international, so you can use any UK/US card in either country, however in many cases the financial insitution who owns the cash machine will charge you a transaction fee.  With Barclay&amp;#039;s you can use a Bank Of America Debit card in any Barclay&amp;#039;s cash machine and vice versa without any transaction fee.
