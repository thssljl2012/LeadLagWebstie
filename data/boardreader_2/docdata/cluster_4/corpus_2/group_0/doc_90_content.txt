  hi, i created an account with barclays at the weekend for their monthly savings account. i stupidly didnt ask the lady this question: is there a time of the month when i cant pay in? i seem to remember I had a regular savings account in the past and i could only set up a standing order to pay within a certain time each month. Ild like to set up a standing order on the 16th of each month.
