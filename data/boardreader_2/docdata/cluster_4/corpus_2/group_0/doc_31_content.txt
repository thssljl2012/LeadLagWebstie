                                           Churning Barclays US Mastercard?                                                                                                           document.write(&amp;#039;  &amp;#039;);                                                                                          I noticed that the Barclays Mastercard has  increased their initial payout to 35,000 miles  (with balance transfer). I already have a US Air Barclays card, but it usually sits dormant (one charge every 2/3 months).       Has anybody ever had experience getting a second card, and if so, did they give you the full bonus the second time?      Thanks.
