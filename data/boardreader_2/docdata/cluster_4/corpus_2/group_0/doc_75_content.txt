  We used Martin&amp;#039;s template letters, after having a loan for 12000 with Barclays, payable over 7 years, which included PPI.  We paid the loan off in full after 4 years.       They rejected the first and second requests, sending information about complaining to the Ombudsman, which we duly did.     It took several months for the Ombudsman to process our claim, which was because they were awaiting the result of the test case.       We are delighted to say that we received a letter from the Ombudsman last week, stating that Barlcays had agreed that the PPI payment had been mis-sold and agreed to repay the PPI payments in full, including interest.     Today we received a payment directly into our bank from Barclays for 3300!!!  Brilliant.  Thanks Martin.  You&amp;#039;re welcome for a drink any time!     Jack and Jill
