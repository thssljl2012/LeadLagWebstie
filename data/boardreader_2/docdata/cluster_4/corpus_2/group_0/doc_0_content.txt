Alan, it&amp;#039;s no biggy.. ya just get yaself off to barclays start an account with debit function...done.. NO CREDIT etc.. and it&amp;#039;s the same with pay pal... I bet they have to pay commission to them if they use it.. someone else already asked this..      something I bought, 4 MORE because of using pay pal.      leave say 5 more in the account, than the purchase... and just top it up when u need to buy something..      you don&amp;#039;t need a credit card , as long as the account supports VISA , no problem..      even a Luddite like me can buy things online , before it was just a case of getting someone else to and paying them the money.      the point is you don&amp;#039;t need a credit card... just a debit card with visa functionality.. job dun..                 &amp;amp;lt; Message edited by  Fog  --  6/30/2008 5:22:43 PM   &amp;amp;gt;                                   (in reply to  asimmd )
