          After Making Commercial With Gretzky About Hockey Traditions, Golfer Goes For ItAugust 22, 2008 The Canadian PressMike Weir boasts new facial growth for the start of the PGA Tour's playoffs.Mike Weir decided to take some of Wayne Gretzky's playoff advice to heart.The two men are currently featured in a PGA Tour commercial where Gretzky advises the Canadian lefty to grow a beard for the FedEx Cup playoffs just as hockey players do for the Stanley Cup playoffs.Lo and behold, Weir arrived for The Barclays tournament this week in New Jersey sporting some facial hair. "Yeah, it's definitely psychology," Weir said Friday after shooting a 4-under 67 at Ridgewood Country Club. "I was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow. [When I] got back I thought, 'hey, it's playoff time, maybe I'll just keep it.'It's a hockey thing. In hockey, guys grow the beards, so thought I would give it a shot and see if it works."That 67, combined with Weir's first round 72, left him in a seven-way tie at 139, seven back of leader Steve Stricker. Hunter Mahan is three back of Stricker in second place.Weir, from Bright's Grove, Ontario entered the FedEx Cup playoffs ranked 43rd.The top 120 players after The Barclays will be eligible for the Deutsche Bank Championship next week in Norton, Mass. The field will then be cut to 70 for the BMW Championship in St. Louis and to 30 for the Tour Championship in Atlanta.Oshawa's Jon Mills and Calgary's Stephen Ames missed the cut.
