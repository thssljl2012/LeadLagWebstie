today i went to make a payment on my target visa card online like i always do, and for some reason, the "soonest it can be delivered" is the 26th. yeah, that's fucking awesome considering it's due in two days, which is when it should be delivered&amp;nbsp;according to the fact that&amp;nbsp;it said, "next day delivery"&amp;nbsp;when i was scheduling the payment, and it's been delivered the next day every time i've made other payments the exact same way for the past TWO FUCKING YEARS!! but no, bank of america fucks me again. SUCK MY DICK YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES. "thank you for choosing bank of america." thanks for ruining my credit, you fucking cocksuckers.
