 Capital One and Chase are PISSED that I'm not using their online banking services to pay my credit cards.&amp;nbsp; Capital One keeps telling me&amp;nbsp; how EASY it is and Chase is all COME BACK. COME BACK TO JESUS.&amp;nbsp; Now that I have Bank of America, though, I can pay ALL MY BILLS AT ONCE AT THE CLICK OF A BUTTON, HOOKER.Capital One is the most butt hurt, though.&amp;nbsp; See, I asked them over and over again to lower my interest rate and they refused. It lowered my self-esteem, people.&amp;nbsp; So guess what?&amp;nbsp; I packed up shop and moved to Bank of America.&amp;nbsp; And now they're all, OK YOUR INTEREST RATE IS LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IT WAS (which is still too high).&amp;nbsp; And I still won't use them.&amp;nbsp; Now they're sending me notices in the mail saying "someone" is trying to close my account.&amp;nbsp; Nice try, Capital One.Okay, this morning I saw 209 pounds on my scale and I am more impatient than ever to get back into the 190s.&amp;nbsp; Pray for my metabolism, people!&amp;nbsp; Last year around this time I was 230 pounds, and a few weeks ago I was 217.&amp;nbsp; Oh man, and I'm getting much stronger.&amp;nbsp; Next week I get to increase my sets!!!!!!I have to go because I'm going to be late.&amp;nbsp; SEE THIS IS WHY I NEVER GET A CHANCE TO COMMENT, LJ.
