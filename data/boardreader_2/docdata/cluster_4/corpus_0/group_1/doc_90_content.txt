 soooooooooa couple days ago i deposited a check for 1000 dollars,  its my money but it was in another account and i wanted it in my texas account.  now i know it will take a couple days to post, cos its a delaware bank yada yada and im in texas now, which is fine.so i go to check my statement to see if it had posted.  it hadnt fine, i get that, BUT Bank of Assholes had deducted a 900 dollar debit/hold from my account.This is my completely cleared, already posted 900 dollars.  Not, oh here is the 1000 minus 900. no no.  no 1000, and minus 900.  that minus 900 is almost half what i have in the account.of course, i dont know this, until a representative that i finally find thru online help services tells me so, but since they cant comment on pending transactions makes it seem as tho the 1000 and the 900 wont be available until sept 2nd.this sets me off completely, cos i have bills to pay and i am fiscally responsible lady.the 900 will be back in a day or two, but where in the fucking fuck, do they get the right to debit my account, my money like that?  not post the 1000, i get.  but then debit 900??? what in the utter fucking wrongness.that 900 is mine, posted.  now i almost paid my cc today.  and i would have paid 2000 bucks today.  had i done this, i would have discovered that my account was overdrawn.this isnt some fee i signed up for!  this is not something made explicit when signing up for the account.  and i know yada yada fine print.  but what the hell?  so if i tried to deposit a check and had say 50 dollars in my account, would i then have been -850?!  for depositing a check!hell no.   this will not stand!  that is not how a bank manages an account!  you do not hold half their worth like that.  no way.im so pissed off.
