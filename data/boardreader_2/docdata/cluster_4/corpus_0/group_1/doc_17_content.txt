Count Steve Stricker among those that love the FedExCup. Hearkening back to his performance of last year, Stricker fired a nifty 64 to overtake 1st round leader Hunter Mahan at The Barclays. Stricker punched out after his day's work at -10, while Mahan slipped precipitously with a 2nd round 73 that left him three in arrears at -7. A hole out eagle on the 3rd hole, coupled with a birdie on the 2nd jump started Stricker's day. Four more birdies and nary a bogey finished his clean card. Five bogeys today prevented Mahan from hanging on to the advantage he'd earned with his 1st round 62. "Sybil golf", just like my game.Behind the two leaders saw a knot for 3rd featuring Angel Cabrera, 67, Dudley "Dooright" Hart, 69, and Kenny Perry, 67, doing his best Hume Croyn impression that we've seen all year. Hey Kenny! You've already made Azinger's squad. A quad at -5 included Paul Casey, 71, Sergio, 67, Anthony Kim, 67, and Kevin Streelman, 70, who is highly regarding in my rookie of the year debate. Barclays sign wearer, Phil Mickelson, paired rounds of 70,70, to end up tied for 21st.Bombers and Crashers.....Players missing the cut at +1, with the Americans in the group failing to impress captain Azinger include, Woody, Baddeley, Els, O'Hair, Villegas, Harrington, Ogilvy, Zach Johnson, Goosen, Couples, DiMarco, and Pat Perez.Most players are commenting on the superb conditions at Ridegewood Country Club. It favors positioning and placement. The greens are immaculate and no one seems to miss Westchester. Moves are made tomorrow. Tune in.Til, next,Remember, stinging wit required. Like what you see?
