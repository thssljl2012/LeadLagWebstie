I&amp;#8217;ve read that Arnold Palmer changed putters (and other clubs) more often than greenskeepers changed pin placements. Well, almost. As the defending champion of The Barclays, Steve Stricker was being quizzed today on a number of subjects in the media center, including the putter. So is Stricker a one-putter guy?

Well, almost. As the defending champion of The Barclays, Steve Stricker was being quizzed today on a number of subjects in the media center, including the putter. So is Stricker a one-putter guy? I am, Stricks told the scribblers. I&amp;#8217;ve had the same type of putter my entire career. And what is the name of his lifelong putter sweetheart?

And how long has this relationship lasted? I&amp;#8217;ve putted with the same one for probably the last four or five years, Steve said. I may change the grip on there every once in awhile, but that&amp;#8217;s about as bizarre as I get. Whoa. Dont get too wild, Stricks. The first leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, The Barclays gets underway tomorrow at Ridgewood Country Club in Paramus, New Jersey.
