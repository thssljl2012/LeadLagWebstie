 A little over a month ago and referring to the $20 million Governor Goodhair giveaway of taxpayer money to the criminal Countrywide Financial, ONF said, Look for Bank of America and Goodhair to spin this in a manner that allows this heist job to stand.Well, it has come to pass. According to comments by a Bank of America spokesperson in a DMN article, "Bank of America has adopted the agreement. We're committed to meeting the terms of that agreement."It don't take no Einstein to see through this one.Yeah, Bank of America will create the promised 7,500 jobs in TEXAS, while laying off a whole bunch of other folks - say 7,500 - elsewhere in the US. Bank of America did NOT buy Countrywide Financial with any intention other than consolidating and integrating the Countrywide Financial workforce into its own workforce.This is kind of like borrowing $7,500 from a loan company, depositing it into your checking account and telling your wife you got a big bonus at work!It's a shell game and the Texas taxpayer is the mark!You're doing a heck of a job, Goodhair.til next time....OLDnFEEBLE
