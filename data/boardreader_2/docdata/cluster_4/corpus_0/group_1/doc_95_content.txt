 I got an email this morning asking me to confirm my Bank of America (US) account details and pin...Now, obviously, one should NEVER respond to emails like this. Financial institutions will never ask you for your pin number over the internet. However, as I do not have, never have had, and never will have an account with Bank of America, I figured responding to this one would not do any real harm, provided my anti-virus and anti-spyware software is up to date.So, I clicked the link and arrived at an official looking web site which asked me to input my debit card number and pin number, and confirm which state I lived in. I told them I lived in Alaska and typed in some random crap for both numbers.Now, if you ever need to check the authenticity of a website that is asking you for a card number, there are three pretty good checks. First, is the page secure? This is not a really good test as anyone can create a secure web page, but if it isn't, don't use it! Second, does the page ask for your PIN? If so don't use it. It should instead ask for the three digit security code. Finally, and the best check of all, if you enter some random digits in the card number, any genuine web page will reject it. The reason being that a genuine card entry web page will have a direct link to a card services database where your credit or debit card will be instantly validated. A spoof website will not have such a link, because it costs money!So, I would love to see the expression on the face of the idiot who spammed me with that one when they try using that random card number....
