Turns out she was buying more than that. After finishing the transaction, she discovered she had also signed up for a $10.95 insurance policy. How did that happen? A small box at the bottom of the booking screen was pre-checked, indicating she also wanted to buy the policy. It was up to her to uncheck it. Unfortunately, this box is very hard to even notice this until after the purchase is made and you receive an email providing the travel insurance information. It should not be a default setting to purchase travel insurance. She&amp;#8217;s right. Other travel companies have done this in the past, and it just infuriates customers. What&amp;#8217;s more, it&amp;#8217;s not a generally accepted practice in the electronic commerce world. You ask customers to opt-in to a newsletter or product &amp;#8212; even when you&amp;#8217;re bankrupt. Gross received an email a few minutes later. From: Policies [mailto:policies@travelguard.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 13, 2008 8:33 PM To: Gross, Angela Subject: Travel Guard Policy #905033614 ANGELA  GROSS, Thank you for purchasing a travel insurance plan from AIG Travel Guard. ******************************************************* *Your policy number is: 905033614 ******************************************************* *We invite you to view/print your travel insurance documents *If you have any questions please contact our 24-hour World Service Center at: Enjoy your travel and thank you for choosing AIG Travel Guard for your upcoming trip! She contacted Frontier, but it said it couldn&amp;#8217;t help her because her policy was underwritten by AIG. I emailed both the airline and insurance company on her behalf. AIG spokesman Dan McGinnity said Gross should be able to get a full refund for her policy. We are a third-party provider of a value added service that Frontier offers it clients. Many airlines and travel suppliers now offer travel insurance and feel it is an important component of the overall travel purchase. We do offer a full refund for clients who decide they do not want the travel insurance protection, as long as they contact us prior to their trip. Less than 1/2 of 1 percent of those who purchase our travel insurance from the Frontier Airlines Web site have requested a refund. For its part, Frontier has promised to &amp;#8220;track down what happened&amp;#8221; and report back to me. Here&amp;#8217;s what spokesman Steve Snyder had to say about the case: I know Angela shouldn&amp;#8217;t have been told we can&amp;#8217;t do anything for her. She should be given a full refund. I&amp;#8217;ll get back to you shortly with a thorough explanation of all this. Sorry Angela had to go through all this. Gross remains indignant, and rightfully so. &amp;#8220;I cant even imagine how much money these guys are making off of innocent mistakes,&amp;#8221; she told me. Neither do I. But I think they should stop. Update: Here&amp;#8217;s Snyder&amp;#8217;s follow-up response: Ms. Gross should not have been told that Frontier cant help her. When we have questions about the travel insurance, we reimburse the customer immediately, with no questions asked. Im not sure why that didnt happen in her case, but we will contact her and fix that. As to the larger question of whether we are trying to sneak something by our customers, we dont believe we are. When we first started the opt out option instead of the opt in, we received a number of questions from people who felt the information was not displayed prominently enough. Perhaps thats when Ms. Gross had the issue. We made some changes to try to make it as obvious as possible. The questions have dropped significantly since, and we now know that 75 percent of the people booking on our web site are unchecking the box. I would encourage you to go through the process of booking a ticket and see for yourself.  We think its quite prominent. And that brings us to the other 25 percent. Those are the people who are buying the insurance, and those are the people we were not reaching when we had the opt out option. Our typical web site consumer is buying tickets about 45 days out. Those who are buying the insurance are typically buying more than 60 days out. We believe those people are buying the insurance for the extra piece of mind. That falls in line with why we offer the flight insurance. Quite frankly, we are selling a product that we believe in. Currently our change fee is $150 plus difference in fare. The travel insurance covers the items that typically cause people to change their flights, and we think $10.99 insurance is a better deal than a $150 change fee plus fare difference. However, we realize some people dont agree, and we have made it very obvious how to uncheck the box. Even if our customers miss that, they can always call to get a refund immediately, no questions asked, and they can do it up until the time of their flight. We certainly apologize that Ms. Gross didnt receive better customer service when she tried to get this issue resolved, and we will be contacting her to resolve the matter.
