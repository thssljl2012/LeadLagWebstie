Ian Poulter withdrew Monday from the Johnnie Walker Championship in Scotland, pretty much thumbing his nose at any chances for making the European Ryder Cup team.  Instead, Poulter chose to stay in the PGA Tour playoffs and its giant payoff.  &amp;#8220;It has been an extremely difficult decision to make given my burning desire to represent Europe again in defending the Ryder Cup in the United States,&amp;#8221; Poulter told the International Herald Tribune.  Poulter is about $105,000 short of the 10th and final spot for the Euro team, and could have made it by finishing top-5 at the Johnnie Walker.  Poulter dropped 26 spots to No. 89 in the FedEx Cup standings after missing the cut in last week&amp;#8217;s Barclays. He&amp;#8217;ll play in this week&amp;#8217;s Deutsche Bank Championship, the second round of the playoffs.  Poulter told the Herald Tribune he talked to Euro captain Nick Faldo and said he hopes to be a captain&amp;#8217;s pick.  Who&amp;#8217;s he trying to kid? Poulter&amp;#8217;s had two top-10 finishes this year, second at the British Open and a tie for ninth in Abu Dhabi.  Remember, this is the guy who said recently it would soon by only him and Tiger at the top.
