Now a growing number of institutions are charging customers such fees even before the transaction overdraws their account. Bank of America and TD Banknorth started doing it earlier this year. SunTrust, among other banks, has been doing it for a few years. Here&amp;apos;s how it works: If you pay with your debit card, some banks will now charge you a fee  $35 or more  if you don&amp;apos;t have funds in your account at the time you sign for the purchase. Previously, you didn&amp;apos;t get charged this fee unless you were short of cash when the signature debit transaction cleared a few days later. That meant that, while the signature debit transaction was pending, consumers could often deposit money to cover any potential overdraft. (By contrast, PIN transactions typically clear immediately.) Leslie Parrish, senior researcher at the Center for Responsible Lending, argues that this is &amp;quot;another way (for banks) to manipulate account holders&amp;apos; balances to spur more overdraft fees.&amp;quot; Banks defend the practice, saying it provides customers with accurate information about account balances. Purchases can trigger overdraft fees even before they clear - USATODAY.com.
