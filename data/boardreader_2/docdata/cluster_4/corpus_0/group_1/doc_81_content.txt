 (Disclaimer: Chase Bank are NOT stupidheads. I tagged this blog as such so everyone could follow my banking exploits in an orderly fashion)Dear Chase Bank -Tomorrow, I'm coming in to your East Lakeview branch to open a checking and savings account with you.Then, as soon as Bank of America gets their thumbs (and my lost check) out of their asses, I'm going to take everything I have there and bring it over to you, along with my heart.Because, while I'm fairly sure that - deep down - you're just as evil as Bank of America, you can't POSSIBLY do a worse job of managing my money and providing Customer Service than Bank of America has. (I could probably hand my money to a bum on the sidewalk and have an easier time of it.)So, Chase - This is me saying Hello.I look forward to meeting you in person tomorrow.Love,JamieP.S.
