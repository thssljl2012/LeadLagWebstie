He shot a 2 over 73 to finish at 3 over, missing the cut by two strokes.  My FedEx Cup dark horse picks, Anthony Kim (tied for 6th at -5) and Phil Mickelson (tied for 21st at -2), both made the cut.  Of the top 12 in the FedEx Cup standings, Geoff Ogilvy and Ryuji Imada, missed the cut as well. Eliminated from the playoffs by virtue of missing the cut and being outside of the top 120 are Tom Lehman, Jason Gore, Jon Mills, David Toms, James Driscoll, Chris DiMarco, and Joe Durant.
