     The dust has settled finally.&amp;nbsp; Last month was astounding.&amp;nbsp; Red, red, red numbers.&amp;nbsp; The last time this happened it was at the same bank and I swore that if it happened again I would switch to Wells Fargo.&amp;nbsp; I was going to do that - I had every intention of closing my accounts and moving them.&amp;nbsp; Until - one Saturday I was checking the account my initial page looked different.&amp;nbsp; Since I only make a screen shot when things get odd looking I had nothing to compare it to but it did look off.&amp;nbsp; It was a weekend and I almost didn't access it.&amp;nbsp; I did and afterwards I looked at the source  code (accessible under the view source link).&amp;nbsp;  Obviously there have been some new recent trends in banking that I have been unaware of.&amp;nbsp; My bank is just one of the octopus' arms.&amp;nbsp; The policies of all of these banks are the same.&amp;nbsp; If I change my banking location it will be simply because it is closer.&amp;nbsp;  The bummer to me is that my birthday is next Thursday and my birthday money was what got gobbled up with all the extra charges.&amp;nbsp; This would have been the first money in seven years that I had to spend on me and still take care of the responsibilities.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I have read the news and know that many, many people have it much, much worse.&amp;nbsp; But you know what, There is not a damn thing in the world wrong with being very disappointed about this.&amp;nbsp; Period. &amp;nbsp; Technorati Tags: Compass, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, banking fees, overdraft charges
