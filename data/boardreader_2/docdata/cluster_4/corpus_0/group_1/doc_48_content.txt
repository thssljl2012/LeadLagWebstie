The man in fourth is the defending champion this week, Phil Mickelson.Last year's win was a big one for Mickelson, not just because it improved his standings in the FedEx Cup Playoffs. Mickelson shot a final-round 66 to win the event by two, but there was more to it.Mickelson won for the first time playing alongside Tiger Woods in a final round. A big step to be sure, Mickelson eventually finished third in last year's FedEx Cup Playoffs behind Woods and Steve Stricker.The current leader doesn't figure to lose much ground this week. Singh has a win at this event, a second and a fourth. He has two wins in August (WGC- Bridgestone Invitational and The Barclays).Week two of the Playoffs isn't the only major theme looming this week.
