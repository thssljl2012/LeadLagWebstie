 I briefly considered driving to Niagara Falls (New York) today, to close down the Bank of America account that I left open when I moved back from California.  I left about $300 in there, in case there were any unexpected bills to be paid after I left - or in case I wound up getting a tax rebate cheque.  Neither was the case, so there the money sits.  However, I called up BofA, and was told that because California Bank of America is on a separate computer network from the rest of the company, it'd be easier if I closed down the account out there.  So...one more excuse to go back for a visit.  Hopefully Labour Day.  I should really look into booking a flight soon if I want to make that happen.  But I may actually keep the account open into next year, in case I wind up with an IRS refund for 2008.One thing I *did* do was go out for lunch at Boston Pizza with spender and dvarty, who were on their way to visit Dave's sister up here in Brampton.  They're good peeps, and I'm happy for them as they prepare to move into their new home.  I look forward to visits!Aside from getting groceries, I don't anticipate much more productivity today.  I may even take a nap.  Later on, we'll be charring some meat on the BBQ.
