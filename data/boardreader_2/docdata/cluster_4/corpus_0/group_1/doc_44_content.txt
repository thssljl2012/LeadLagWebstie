                 We were in New Jersey last week for the 1st of this year's Fedex Cup Playoffs. The Barclays Classic at Ridgewood Country Club was a good event for both KJ Choi who finished 12th and moved to 11th on the rankings and Stuart Appleby finished 19th and moved to 13th. Both, if they have a win or 2 top 5 finishes the next 2 events will go to the Tour Championship in Atlanta in 4 weeks with a chance to win the 10 million dollar Fedex Cup bonus. In the picture KJ is working on his pitching. If you look closely you will see a glove under his right arm. We work on this to keep his arm swing linked to his body turn. This creates far more consistency with contact, spin and distance control. KJ's full swing is very good now and I think he can find a shot or two a tournament with improved pitching. He shot 68, 69 and 68 the last 3 rounds at Ridgewood to move from making the cut on the number to 12th and had sevral tap in birdies after great pitch shots.
