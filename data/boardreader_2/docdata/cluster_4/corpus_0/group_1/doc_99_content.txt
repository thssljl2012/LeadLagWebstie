 Okay so being new to town I have to tell you that I have a Bank of America account and there are not ANY branches here.So today when I got my expense check I took it to the bank that it was drawn on and that is were my company banks.&amp;nbsp; I was told that because I didn't have a account that I would be charged $7.50 to cash my check that was drawn on the same back my company banks at.&amp;nbsp; I was pissed and was told that if I wanted too I could open a account and they wouldn't charge me.&amp;nbsp; Well I didn't want to open a account with my old address and have my debit card and all my stuff to go there when I am no there.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to wait till I got my permanent address here in MN before I got a account locally.&amp;nbsp; I can tell you this that it WILL NOT be Wells Fargo....Cause Wells Fargo can SUCK IT!!!!
