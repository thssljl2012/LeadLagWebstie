 A couple of years ago, I was tired of paying ATM fees, for example, if I was in a city where there was no ATM for my bank. My ingenious plan was to get a checking account at every bank! That way I could just search in my wallet for the card for the bank with the nearest ATM. As part of that effort, I signed up for Citibank checking &amp; savings. Citibank is interesting because they are very global and have ATM's in many different countries (probably only HSBC is more ubiquitous).Anyways that plan backfired; it was too complicated and I had at one point 4 checking accounts and 2 savings accounts. I found a more effective way to avoid ATM fees is just to avoid ATM's (use debit card instead of cash), and if I really need one and there is no branch of my bank nearby, use an account which doesn't charge fees. The first casualty is Citibank. This account is truly worthless. At one point they were actually paying a respectable interest rate, but it long ago stopped serving any purpose in my financial arsenal.I lodged a call to Bangalore this evening to close down my account, and my request was promptly answered by a young financial assistant, who really shouldn't have even eaten breakfast yet. I feel that Citibank must be doing something right if they are trimming costs by sending their call centers to India, which makes me rethink whether this was the right account to close. I forgot to ask my assistant if she had a sister, or at least a lead on a cheap apartment in Bangalore.The next account to go will be Bank of America, although it will be more complicated since it is much more entrenched in my financial life. Whenever I call them, the phone is answered in America, and that is probably the reason their interest rates are so low, because they spend all of their money funding the Supersized American lifestyle which their call center staff enjoys.
