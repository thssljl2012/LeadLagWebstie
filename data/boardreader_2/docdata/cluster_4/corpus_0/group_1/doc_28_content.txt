Quick and dirty Deutsche Bank Championship predictions this week, folks. Ill be away from my desk for a while and wont have another chance. So excuse the brevity this week; Ill return to my usual rambling soon This weeks 10 players to watch at the Deutsche Bank Championship: Robert Allenby: Has made 21 cuts in a row. 8th here in 07, T4 06, T15 05, T19 03. Ben Curtis: Three top-10s in last 4 events, including last weeks T4 at the Barclays. Lucas Glover: T14 at Deutsche in 07, T12 06. Anthony Kim: T12 at last weeks Barclays. The breakout year continues. Adam Scott: Hes been stinking it up, especially with his 82 on Friday last week. Im hoping pride kicks in and he plays up to his potential. T17 here in 07, T2 04, winner 03. Vijay Singh: I usually avoid picking last weeks winner, since back-to-back victories are rare, but Singh has a great track record here: 2nd 06, winner 04, 4th 03. Kevin Streelman: Red-hot right now and should be full of confidence. T6, T4 last two events. Steve Stricker: Struggled much of this year, and ruined a great showing at the Barclays with a 77 on Saturday. But his game is coming around just at the right time, and dont forget how he rose to the occasion for the Playoffs last year. Bubba Watson: I liked how he played last week, with a very controlled, focused T12. Some success here, with a T12 in 06. Mike Weir: Two top-10s in last three events, including last weeks T7. Lefty Watch: Six lefties in the field this week: Eric Axley, Steve Flesch, Phil Mickelson, Nick OHern, Bubba Watson, Mike Weir. Hope this helps, sorry for the lack of detail this week, and good luck with your picks!
