Now that the US government owns 80% of insurance giant AIG, does that mean that the Manchester United Football Club is now also owned by the USA? Will we see the "AIG" on the front of those uniforms replaced by "USA?"Why not?  Abu Dhabi owns Manchester City F.C., and since the British government took over Newcastle-based bank Northern Rock, it now owns Newcastle United F.C., right?
