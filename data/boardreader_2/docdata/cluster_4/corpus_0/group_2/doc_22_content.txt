 Watch goals by Salomon Kalou and Park Ji-Sung during Chelsea 1-1 Man Utd from the Barclays English Premier League at Stamford Bridge. A thrilling game  obviously  that started without Deco out injured during practice. An Evra move that resulted in a Berbatov shot saved by Petr Cech was snapped up by Park to give Man U the lead. Kalou headed in the equaliser but it came after a complete domination of the 2nd half and the latter 1st half by Chelsea. If not for the Kalou goal, Anelka would have gone back the most rueful having missed a fantastic Joe Cole cross. Didier Drogba and Cristiano Ronaldo who were expected to start didnt and Drogba was the first one on at the start of the 2nd half  well, a little after the start cos of some confusion regarding a friendship band he was wearing. The band was discarded and Drogba was soon on but didnt really stamp himself until right at the gong of the final whistle, which itself was a confusing moment with not many around sure if the whistle had been blown or not  just one of several in a controversial outing for referee Mike Riley.Similar posts:  league soccer
