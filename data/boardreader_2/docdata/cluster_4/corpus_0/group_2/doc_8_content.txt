I hope that he will make a quick recovery and that he will not be out for long."The challenge came in the 66th minute of the third-round match at Old Trafford and left the 19-year-old requiring six minutes of treatment before he was carried off.He was taken to hospital and Manchester United confirmed on Wednesday that the Brazilian, who was making his first start for United, had not broken his leg.A statement on United's website read: "We can confirm that Rodrigo did not suffer a break to his right leg."He was kept in hospital overnight for observation and to assess whether there was any ligament damage to his knee."The incident was condemned by an angry Ferguson, who was unhappy with the reaction of Pogatetz to the red card."It was an absolutely terrible tackle," he said. "What gets me about challenges like that is that the opponent always claims he has done nothing wrong.Ferguson also expressed his disappointment at the reaction of some Middlesbrough officials, who visibly complained as Pogatetz received a straight red card for the foul."You get their bench screaming that it wasn't a sending off and there is nothing wrong with our player," added Ferguson."At least Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate was very good about it. He apologised and understood the gravity."Southgate conceded Pogatetz deserved to be sent off."We can have no complaints about the decision," he confirmed."It is difficult to know why it happened. It was an unusual aberration for him because his discipline has improved in the last two years."A couple of lads on our bench did not have the same view as I did but that is dealt with now. We can only hope the lad recovers."Pogatetz will miss Middlesbrough's next three matches, while Southgate could take additional disciplinary action.
