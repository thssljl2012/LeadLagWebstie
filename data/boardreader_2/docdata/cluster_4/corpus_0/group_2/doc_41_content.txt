Well, in the end, only three names really mattered in the Playoffs - Vijay Singh, Camilo Villegas, and Sergio Garcia.&amp;nbsp; Sure, some others showed up here and there.&amp;nbsp; Ken Duke had a nice run.&amp;nbsp; So did others.&amp;nbsp; But, when it comes right down to it, it was this big three that made the Playoffs interesting and intriguing. Last year, we had one man dominate the Playoffs - Tiger Woods.&amp;nbsp; Sure, Steve Stricker was big after the Barclays.&amp;nbsp; Phil had a heck of an event in Boston.&amp;nbsp; But, for the whole four weeks, it boiled down to Tiger. Despite Vijay having won this thing entering the Tour Championship, is the fact that Villegas won twice and Sergio got into two playoffs helpful in the perception of the excitement behind these four weeks? And, are we getting what we want from the FedEx Cup?&amp;nbsp; (Great golf in September.)
