  Oh yeah, I said it.I HATE HATE HATE Bank of America with a passion.  We have had our accounts with them for over a year and a half and we have had nothing but problems.  They like to change their policies-both formal and informal-whenever they feel like it without notifying customers.Today was the final straw.  We received $240 in overdraft fees for things that are NOT our fault.  In the past we've been dorks and gotten fees and we pay them when they are our fault.  I use internet banking religiously and use that for keeping track of my checkbook.  I'm a nazi about it.  I write everything down consistently and balance things at least once a day.  Apparently BofA decided that they changed not only the way that their online banking showed transactions but how they were processed.  In the end I fork out a shit load of money for fees that are not my fault.  And I have to pay them or my rent check will not clear.I fucking hate them.  This is not the first time either.  I would say we've paid well over $750 in fees due to their stupidity.  Every time they change something we adapt and they go and fuck it up again.Messing with my money is something that will send me over the edge in a heartbeat.  Especially when it's more than a week before payday and I now have NO money for food, gas, or anything else that might come up.  I thought we had a nice cushion until they start posting shit and backdating it for no apparent reason.Bastards.
