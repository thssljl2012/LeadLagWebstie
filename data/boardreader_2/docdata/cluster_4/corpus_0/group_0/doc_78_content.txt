 Publix just started charging ATM fees... HARD. As in... they apparently just charged me ATM fees for every time I used one of their ATMs since March, RETROACTIVELY. I never agreed to that $1.50 fee for each transaction, so I'm going to complain quite bitterly.There is a sign at the ATM that says you MAY be charged a terminal usage fee AS INDICATED. If none was indicated --- I didn't agree to pay it. Simple as that.Publix apparently partners with Bank of America to operate their ATMs, so if you're a Bank of America customer, there's no problem... but, apparently, they're doing it with the credit union's network (unknown?) and SunTrust; presumably, it affects every other bank's accounts.This is annoying, as the rapid string of ATM fees also killed the overdraft courtesy feature on my account, which would have just automatically replenished from my savings account. The thing was supposed to be good for only three cycles of that in a year. I'll talk to the branch manager and see if I can get them to reinstate that, for that was just irrationally obnoxious!As always, though, the credit union's own ATMs don't charge a fee... and I guess they're the last place that doesn't! fgsfds...Well then... it's really convenient that Elyse gave me this referral card for Bank of America. I shall use it soon, so there will be more than like three ATMs in existence that I can use without FEE RAPE. Besides, I get a $25 credit for opening the account.Geez. How did ATM fees even get started? I kinda remember it being like, someone discovered one day that it was LEGAL to do it, so every bank in existence was on it by THE NEXT DAY. How long before it becomes illegal again, I wonder....?
