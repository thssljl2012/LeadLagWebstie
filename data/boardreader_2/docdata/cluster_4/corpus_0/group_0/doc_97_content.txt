 so today is 13 days.it's starting to feel like it might actually happen.and also.next month i finally get to close my terrible bank of america account.so get this.i went to get my bank statements...only to find out i was 42 cents overdrawn with bank of america.this was thursday the 11th, mind you, and I hadnt used the account since the 4th...i had $29 in it and the next thing posting is a $25 charge to christian children's fund...on the 17th....so.i talk to the lady.do some figuring.this is what happened.the last time i used the card was july 4th, at this place called desert moon...a shitty shitty shitty mexican place at the holyoke mall. i spent $17i knew this would bring me below $25 once everything cleared, so i transferred $20 from my sovereign account. that would leave me with like...$39, but i figure why not...just in case i forgot about something i charged.so...apparently that charge went through on monday.the day i made that transfer.tuesday, the money came OUT of my sovereign account...so i'm like "ok, i'm good"apparently wednesday, 9 things....NINE THINGS...cleared AFTER the LAST thing i charged.but whatever, i should have enough to cover it.nope.i had 42 cents too little...because apparently that transfer STILL hadnt posted on wednesday.so they transfer the $13 or so from my keep the change, which is more than enough to cover the difference...but it's only like $9...which 9, plus the 20 i just transferred would be enough to cover the christian childrens fund payment...but then they charge me $10 for the automatic transfer of 13 (seems a sensible policy), bringing me to 42 cents negative.this is on wednesday.THURSDAY, 3 days after the fact, 4 days if you count the fact that my initial transfer was made pretty early on monday...the transfer finally posts.this brings my balance to 19.52...just UNDER (because of the fee) what i need to cover the ccf payment.soooo.....now that payment is pending, overdrawing me by $5.something.Which it shouldn't be, because there should have been no automatic transfer fee, because i made a manual transfer before it happened.GAH!so i just called and got that $10 refunded...but they say that even though it was refunded, that overdraft fee is going to be assessed to the account (even though i now have $6 more than i need...) so i have to call on tuesday and talk about that.needless to say...i am closing this account next month.why next month? why not now...or 6 months ago?because i have about $100 in matching money from keep the change being deposited from them in august...no way im going through all this shit and NOT getting that money from them.anyway.13 days.im starting to really think what i want to do with the house...even though im trying to stop myself from thinking of it...because if i lose it somehow...the shits really gotta hit the fan.
