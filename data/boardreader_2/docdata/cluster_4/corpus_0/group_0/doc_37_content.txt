            For those who prefer to open a CD at a branch, Bank of America has a 4.00% APY 7-month CD. This rate is just a little lower than what you can get if you apply online. This brick-and-mortar rate doesn't seem to be listed at Bank of America's website. It has been advertised in several newspapers. Here are online ads from Dallas and San Francisco. The minimum deposit may vary by state. In the San Francisco ad, the minimum deposit is $5,000. In Dallas, it's $10,000. Some details from the ad's small print include: funds must be new to BofA and the maximum deposit limit is $2.5 million per household.If you open this 7-month special CD, just be sure that you don't let it automatically roll over into their standard CDs. Their current rate for CDs with terms of 6 to 11 months is under 2%.For more details about Bank of America's 4.11% 7-month Online CD, please refer to this Friday post.To review other CD promotions from other major banks, please refer to my latest weekly summary.Thanks to the readers who emailed me this info.Labels: Bank of America, banks, certificates of deposit, large deposits, nationally available
