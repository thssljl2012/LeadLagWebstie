 So I've fallen off the radar.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This month has been pretty hectic.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My dad hasn't been feeling well lately.&amp;nbsp; As many of you know, he has Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), and his feet were getting cold.&amp;nbsp; He went to a specialist to have it looked at , and the bloodflow to his feet was lacking because his arteries&amp;nbsp;were clogged.&amp;nbsp; Well, on the 2nd, he had a femoral-to-femoral crossover (bypass), as well as another bypass down his left leg.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;nbsp;also has an aneurysm in his descending abdominal aorta (the big artery carrying blood to the body), but they're going to&amp;nbsp;just watch that one for now since it is relatively minor.&amp;nbsp; His surgery went really well, and he&amp;nbsp;was asking&amp;nbsp;the nurses for a steak dinner as soon as he woke up. Most of my energy lately has been devoted to helping him feel better, as well as to my two jobs and the dental conference that took place last Friday.&amp;nbsp; He's feeling a lot better now, and he and my&amp;nbsp;mom set off for Oregon today to visit my aunt and uncle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And today....I went to the ATM at the Bank of America near Southcenter Mall to withdraw some cash for this week.&amp;nbsp; However, my mind was in a different place and I&amp;nbsp;left without&amp;nbsp;completing my session and retrieving my card.&amp;nbsp; I then went to the Thai place I frequent to get&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;fresh spring rolls to go.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was there that I realized I didn't have my ATM card.&amp;nbsp; I immediately turned around and went back to the bank to cancel it.&amp;nbsp; They closed at 1 pm, and I was the last person in the door.&amp;nbsp; The ATM had not "sucked up" my card, which means someone had taken it.&amp;nbsp; I talked to a bank representative to have the card canceled, and asked to confirm the last transaction that had been made.&amp;nbsp; It should have been the $50 cash that I withdrew.&amp;nbsp; Well, it wasn't.&amp;nbsp; Someone had gotten hold of my card, pressed the "yes" button to make another transaction, and proceeded to withdraw almost $300 from my account.&amp;nbsp; Evidently, he had tried to withdraw more, but my account has a cap of how much money can be withdrawn from it in one day (thank goodness).&amp;nbsp; On a friend's advice, I immediately filed a police report and a case with the bank.&amp;nbsp; The ATM surveillance tapes will be reviewed, and I'll get my money back.&amp;nbsp; And I hope the creep gets caught.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, I hope he's enjoying his $260 shopping spree on Bank of America's dime.&amp;nbsp;
