 I've been paying off my credit cards in full for the last three months, maintaining a zero balance.  This month I finished paying off my "Line of Credit" for business checking, which is the last of the debt.I got my B of A card statement today.  There in fine print is: "Please note: Your due date has changed...."Sure enough, and strangely enough, I owe 5 days earlier.  Gosh, I wonder why the date didn't change to 5 days later?And...there was no envelope for the bill to send back.Nice.  So I use a blank envelope and lose it in the works?  I make a trip down to the bank and pay in person?  I sign up for their online presence and give them all the info?I don't want to do any of these things.  Nor should I have to.So....if I was of a suspicious nature, I'd think they were trying to screw me.I'm sure it was all innocent.@%#$@$%@  Credit Cards!(Edited:  Actually they moved the date up a full week.  At least they included a notice, in nice small fine print.....)To continue the saga.  I call them.  They say the bill was sent on the 18th, which means it took 7 days to get here.  Almost nowhere does it take seven days, five days is the norm.Let that pass.  So I ask, "If I send to the payment address, will it get there?""Oh, no.  You need a special code and address."But you see, I knew that because it happened to me several years ago.So, assuming a 7 days mailing time to be safe:  I have 4 days to pay the bill upon arrival.4 days.Which if I had done the logical thing and addressed my envelope to:  "Mail payments to;Bank of America, P.O. Box xxxx, Baltimore, Md 21297-1220," It ALMOST CERTAINLY wouldn't have gotten there!Yes, sir.  Good thing I don't have suspicious nature.I'm sure there was no intention of trapping the unwary.That would be cheap trick.Surely Bank of America wouldn't resort to cheap tricks?Hey, Congress!  WAKE THE FUCK UP!
