  Recently, I've been shopping around for a new bank because my current one is closing its branch near my work. While looking, I checked my Bank of America account and noticed that they were offering two deals.(1) They were offering me $75 to open an account, if I funded it with $25 because I hold a credit card but have no other accounts with them.(2) They were offering me money to refer a friend, and if they signed up, both of us would get $25.Both are easy ways to make some quick money. Check them out.Notice: Bank of America is not providing me any consideration for this post. This is purely to provide information.
