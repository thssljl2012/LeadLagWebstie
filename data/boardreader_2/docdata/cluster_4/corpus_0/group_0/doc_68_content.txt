Not a huge fan of Bank of America, and here&amp;#8217;s another compelling reason not to be.  Bank of America Advert The above image made me chuckle quite a bit. So the answer for me getting out of debt, is to BORROW MORE MONEY!!! Oh my gosh!!! So freakin&amp;#8217; amazing!!! I don&amp;#8217;t know what I&amp;#8217;d be able to do without Band of America and all their financial advice. I would have never thought that the very thing that got me in debt would be the thing to get me out of it. Fight fire with fire I guess. Anyway, I&amp;#8217;m off to borrow more money. How about you?
