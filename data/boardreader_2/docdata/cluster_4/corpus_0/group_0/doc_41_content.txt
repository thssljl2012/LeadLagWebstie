Okay, so some of you already know the issues I've been having with Bank of America over my payroll check.  Well, because the bank told me that they would be releasing my money (and then didn't!) I incurred a $35 overdraft charge.  A guy I spoke to last week told me that once they released my money to call back and they would take the charge off of my account.Well, I just called and the stupid bitch I spoke to said, "I'm sorry but I can't refund any of that money because it is a legitimate charge."  I ask her, even though the manager at my local bank told me my money would be available to me and then forgot to release it, I'm having to pay for her fucking mistake?  YES, BASICALLY THAT IS IT.I cannot wait to switch my fucking account from Bank of America.  This is one of the worst banks I've ever banked with.  Just a heads up.  So if you're thinking of switching to them, DON'T.  They're so fucking ridiculous.AAAGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
