 I decided today in order to avoid getting semi shafted by depositing my check directly into my bank account, since it might take from 5 days to a few weeks to clear.&amp;nbsp; (I dunno specifically, but WaMu was kinda... I dunno last time.&amp;nbsp; Only thing against them.)&amp;nbsp; Anyway, I decide to cash my paycheck first, and head to the local Bank of America, since I can do that and the checks are backed by that bank.&amp;nbsp; I cash the check, and then walk out, getting a little niggling feeling.&amp;nbsp; I check the cash, and then check it against the check.&amp;nbsp; The teller gave me $100 over what my check is actually worth.&amp;nbsp; I'm not... sure what to do with the extra money.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp; mean... my luck seems to be turning, but I'm not sure whether this is good or bad luck.&amp;nbsp; I did win $10 on a scratch ticket I played on a whim...&amp;nbsp; But what is this?&amp;nbsp; I do need the money.. but possibly at the expense of somebody 's job?&amp;nbsp; Should I give it back, or keep it?
