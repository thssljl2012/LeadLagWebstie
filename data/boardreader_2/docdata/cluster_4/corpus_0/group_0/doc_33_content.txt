Reading the comments on that post is also frightening, as so many Bank of America customers report the same security breaches happening all over the country.  Please, if you do bank with BofA, at least freeze your credit if you aren&amp;#8217;t willing to cancel your account with this rogue bunch. That will prevent any identity thief from taking out credit in your name. Luckily, being THE most vigilant person I have ever known when it comes to her identity (she gets nothing delivered at home except magazines in her dog&amp;#8217;s name, never writes checks or uses a debit card, shreds everything, etc) Amy had already done this. It&amp;#8217;s a good thing she did, too: Every day, she gets more and more &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re sorry, but we cannot issue you a credit card&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; letters from stores and financial institutions with whom the ID thief tried to open lines of credit in her name. I vowed never to patronize Bank of America after reading multiple friends&amp;#8217; accounts of getting treated like crap by them, but this takes my disgust for these goons to a whole new level. I saw Amy in LA back in June and to say that she was distressed by this would be an understatement. She&amp;#8217;s trying to deliver a manuscript of her book to McGraw-Hill and has been completely sidelined by conducting the investigation that BofA refused to undertake. Not to mention the visible emotional anguish she has suffered upon finding her bank account depleted with the cheerful assistance of the bank she&amp;#8217;s given her business for twenty years. Yes, twenty years of patronage and THEY are firing HER as a customer because they can&amp;#8217;t be bothered to fix all of their security issues. I feel sick for her, and sick at the thought of anyone else being subjected to the same nightmare.
