     Ok. Like I was saying yesterday. Its time to grow up and deal with real life things. I have always told myself that its not about the money. Its still true to me. Its not about the money. Money can be earned and if I wanted more money, I can work harder.   I am beginning to read up on how to keep your finance in check. There are heaps out there and to tell you the truth, its getting overwhelming. One, I do not know where to start and two, how am I going to apply what's right for me?&amp;nbsp; Its all too difficult but I am determine not to quit.I did a finance check to see how much I earn and how much I spend, utilities, insurance and etc not including eating out and entertainment and I AM SHOCKED to see how much all these add up. Grrr.... I used ANZ Bank's Planning your budget tool to calculate this.  So now I am looking for ways to reduce my bills how to earn and save more. I have an external savings account, where you do not have an ATM card, and make payments to it from my pay every week. So every week $10 goes into that account. $10 is not much but its what I can afford at the moment. It used to be $5 but when I got my pay rise I added more to the weekly savings too. At least its something right?   Ok, now back to reading.
