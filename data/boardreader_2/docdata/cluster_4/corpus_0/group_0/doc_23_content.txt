 So, I got the call back from bank's E-commerce department today with the info on their fees for setting up payments though my website.To say it's not as economical as continuing to use paypal would be an understatement.For ePDQ-CPI with Barclays;150 initial setup fee25+VAT per month, plus an additional charge of 2% of all transactionsPlus a per-transaction charge of 3.94% for payments made from personal credit cards, 4.67% from business credit or debit cards, and a flat 44.3p on any transaction made from debit cards.UK payments only.There MUST be services out there that charge less, even if it would mean a second bank account. Probably a dedicated web payments service for independent websites.
