Found by rk1, Ryanair Deals   Sorry, not sure if this is posted in the right section or if something similar has been posted before.  Basically; basically for those of us that do not have an electron card the fees for booking a Ryanair flight are huge!   However there is a way round this. Barclays issue Electron gift cards (that can be ordered online) for a flat fee of 3. You can top up to 300 on it and use at any retailer that accepts electron, inluding online. Therefore if you are a regular Ryanair passenger simply purchase one of these cards and then use it to book flights - works out a lot cheaper!
