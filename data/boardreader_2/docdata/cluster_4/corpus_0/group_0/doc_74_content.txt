I still don't have my $3200 (see post below). Hold time to speak with a PayPal representative exceeds 15 min. I'm going down to Bank of America in a minute to sign an affadavit. I'm becoming more and more convinced... I still don't have my $3200 (see post below).Hold time to speak with a PayPal representative exceeds 15 min.I'm going down to Bank of America in a minute to sign an affadavit.I'm becoming more and more convinced that PayPal is running some sort of scam. Bank of America told me that PayPal could have stopped the transaction while it was pending. I informed them some 18 hours before the transaction became final but they refused to stop the transfer of funds. That was on the 10th. It is now the 15th and the money has still not been returned. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but it seems to me that it would be in PayPal's best interest to return the stolen money in a timely manner. They have absolutely no interest in doing that.So now I'll have to leave it to Bank of America to fight with them. This makes me feel like a very small minnow swimming aimlessly in a mean, mean ocean.So, after I sign the affadavit I'm taking Parker to buy some new athletic shoes.At least that way my ocean will be well-outfitted.P.S. I'm not near as bitter as I sound...it's my writing persona.
