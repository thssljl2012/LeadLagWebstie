 So, I'm generally wary of banks. After going through hell with Chevy Chase Bank in DC (picked because it was the one on campus, and while I was there, it was the most accessible), and then having a generally positive experience on Suntrust after people recommended it as a good alternative, I'm all about asking people about their experiences regarding customer service.I'm getting paid on Thursday (OMG CAN I HAVE AN AYYYYYYYY-MEN?) and I want to open a bank account in the East Bay. I was originally going to do Bank of America, but I've heard some semi-disturbing things about them as of late, and the last thing I need is a repeat of battling the evil demons of bank-kind. I've heard good things about WaMu, but I'd like as many opinions as possible. Thus far I'm looking at:Bank of America (but only kinda)Washington MutualWells FargoUnion Bank of CaliforniaDoes anyone have any opinions (either way) about any of these? Good/bad experiences? Advice on picking a bank?
