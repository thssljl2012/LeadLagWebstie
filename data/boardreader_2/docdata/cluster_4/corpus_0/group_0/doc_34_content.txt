So, I decided to go get lunch shortly after 2pm, and when I get downstairs there&amp;#8217;s a bunch of police cars parked outside the Bank of America next to my work. A friend of mine walked by and told me they had been robbed. I was on my way to get money from the ATM anyways, so I went over and listened to a couple of the bank employees talking outside. Seems someone went into the bank to rob them not long before I went downstairs for lunch. They didn&amp;#8217;t go into detail about the how he robbed the bank though. I guess he ran out the front door and down the steps to lower Michigan Ave/Illinois St. The police didn&amp;#8217;t make it in time to catch him. From what I gathered, no one was hurt, and I doubt he got very much considering how quickly it was done. They had the doors closed and locked when I got down there, but I still got to the ATMs after someone came out of the bank (which are accessible with your ATM card after hours). A friend of mine, Liam Ford,who worksat the Tribune (across the street) was out there interviewing the policeetc. I didn&amp;#8217;t stop to say hi lol. Glad I wasn&amp;#8217;t getting money out of the ATM when whoever it was decided to rob the bank LOL.
