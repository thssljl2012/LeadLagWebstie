I know stuff like this goes on all the time, but I just wanted to remind everyone of the Evil assholes that are out there trying to get your banking information.&amp;nbsp; Never, ever, ever, EVER click on a link in an email that states you need to change your information, verify it or unlock your account.&amp;nbsp; Anything like that.&amp;nbsp; If you are ever unsure about emails like this, please contact your bank by opening a new browser and typing in the banks web address on your own or contacting them by phone.&amp;nbsp; It's too easy for us to just click on links these days.&amp;nbsp; I just got this email and it looks very convincing to the uninformed.The links in this email point to madrid10. worldbone. de/bankofamerica.comNotice the country is Germany (.de).&amp;nbsp; While websites from Germany are not bad in general, why would you be asked to go to a Bank of America website in Germany?&amp;nbsp; Notice how the graphics look authentic as well as the equal housing lender "link" at the bottom that goes no where.&amp;nbsp; It's just and underlined font and not a real web link.&amp;nbsp; Also notice that the email address that the notice was sent to is not my valid email address.&amp;nbsp; That means I was blind carbon copied (bcc'd) along with a large group of users on yahoo mail.&amp;nbsp; One more thing I just noticed.&amp;nbsp; The copyright is for 2007 instead of 2008.&amp;nbsp; It's a subtle thing, but BofA would not leave something like that at last years date, especially this far into 2008.Your bank will never, ever send you a request like this via email.&amp;nbsp; You will be contacted by mail or phone.&amp;nbsp; I recommend not using any method listed in any correspondence and don't trust callers on the phone.&amp;nbsp; This is how identity theft happens, people!&amp;nbsp; You initiate the contact through known channels to verify any issues that you might have.&amp;nbsp; Be very cautious of emails like this.&amp;nbsp; The bad guys are out there and the more informed you are about how they are trying to take advantage of us, the better off you will be.&amp;nbsp; I wonder how many people actually clicked on the link and went to the site, entered their information and are now dealing with the consequences?&amp;nbsp; It's scary to think about.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for reading my public service announcement.&amp;nbsp; Now back to your regularly scheduled chaos.
