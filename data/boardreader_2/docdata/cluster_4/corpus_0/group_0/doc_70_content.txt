 Yesterday started off just as lame as any other day, with work. I bank with Bank of America and had plans to drive about 20 minutes away to Lancaster where the closest Branch is. I've only recently moved to this town but cannot comprehend why the hell there is no Bank of America here, (there's every bank but Bank of AMERICA). So I leave for the closest branch right after work after getting off a little late and knowing the bank closes at 4. Sure enough I ran into traffic and didn't make it in time. This is a HUGE bummer to me simply cause the outrageous gas prices and the fact I drive a gas gusler.My uncle and family went out of town yesterday morning so I'm staying at their house to watch Bubba. I'm actually really stoked about it. The dog is great. He always comes off as a mad barker and way too hyper when you first meet him. But he's not always like that. Five minutes into my stay he settled down. He's an awesome dog!You may have noticed I'm a day late on the weight-loss blog! I didn't have access to wireless last night and was unable to post. Yesterday I weighed in at 252lbs. My goal for the week was 254lbs putting me well over my goal. Again, another week of good progress! Next weeks goal will be 249lbs and it'll feel great to progress back into the 240's. I have lost a total of 10lbs and I'm not stopping anytime soon! I'm still just excited as I was when I first started, if not more. Get excited with me!
