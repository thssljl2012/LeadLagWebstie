But 19 dollars, for over a week?&amp;nbsp; Its easy to see how poor people stay poor!   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If youre smug, congratulations on the advice you want to give me so bad  Just have more money in the bank!&amp;nbsp; Plan your spending earlier!&amp;nbsp; Yes yes, good, good for you.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, I will be over here, stressing out over where my next meal is coming from, all because their math, executing in the same milliseconds, processed my deposit LAST instead of FIRST.&amp;nbsp; A second semester Computer Science moron can (and does) write better software!
