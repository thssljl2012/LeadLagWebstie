Well, folks. This one is for all the marbles and a beautiful lucky golden shit statue, suitable for display in the corporate headquarters of either Comcast or Countrywide (now Bank of America). It's been a long, difficult, and sometimes controversial road. In order to get to the final, Comcast defeated Menu Foods, The American Arbitration Association, Ticketmaster, Exxon, and Diebold. Countrywide took down Dish Network, Clear Channel, United Healthcare, Bank of America, and Walmart. Now, the choice is yours: Which company is the Worst Company in America? Here's what a few of you had to say about these two companies: Comcast: "THANK GOD WE'RE A MONOPOLY!" "Comcast is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad company." "Comcast deserves not just worst company but most evil." "Comcast, since I have no choice but to do business with Comcast, if I want cable." "Considering Comcast actually rigged a public hearing with paid schmo's to prevent their opposition from being heard... COMCAST. " Countrywide Home Loans: "The evil they wrought on the economy will be felt for years to come." "Countrywide aggressively sought to cause evil..." "Not only did Countrywide wreck the mortgage industry, they wrecked securities and investments market, thereby forcing investors to the commodities market and driving gas up to $4+ a gallon, thereby driving the costs of food and other products through the roof." "Countrywide has destroyed the housing market...well...country-wide." "Countrywide lent me 7750K on an undocumented, no income, no asset loan, while WalMart demanded an ID for a credit card purchase of $13.71, then wanted the receipt on the way out."
