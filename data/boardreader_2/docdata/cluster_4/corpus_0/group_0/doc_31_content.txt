So on Wednesday Tommy, Jameson, and I took a road trip to Kansas City. I was a member of Bank of America for many years. This is the first debit card I ever got because that is the bank my parents use in Arizona. In Ohio there were no Bank of Americas either and so I had a get a different bank there was well. Here in Omaha they don't have any Bank of Americas either so I just decided to drive to Kansas City withdraw my money and drive back to Omaha. We all got to go on a road trip. Yeah!!! Road trips are fun. We stopped in Westin to go to an irish pub that Easter Rising once played at. It was a nice lunch. I am glad I am no longer a member of Bank of America and now I only have one card. Yippeee!!!
