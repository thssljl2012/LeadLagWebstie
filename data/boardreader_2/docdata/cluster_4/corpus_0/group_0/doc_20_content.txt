 I went to the bank at lunchtime and spoke to a very nice man about the fact that my account is gebrochen. He made a phone call. Some UTTER FUCKWIT WITH NO LIFE has cloned my card. And tried to spend in America on it. Fortunately, Barclays had noticed that there were transax on my card in the States on the same day as transax in the UK, cancelled all the fraudulent ones and stopped my card. Except they failed to tell me this... *eyeroll* So the Nice Man In The Bank chopped up my old debit card and told me that there is a nice new shiny one on its way to me and I can still withdraw money from the account if I go into the bank myself. That though, let us face it is a right faff and hassle. Less of a faff and a hassle is borrowing off Maria til my new card appears *nod* But still. Why? Why do people feel the need to do this? No, really. Rah fuckers.
