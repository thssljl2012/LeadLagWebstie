Ulises Garcia said he was withdrawing cash from a Wachovia Bank and depositing it into a Bank of America so he could pay his bills online. However, the Bank of America teller noticed something funny about 10 of the 36 $100 bills Garcia said he received from Wachovia Bank &amp;#8212; they were counterfeit, a local news story in Florida reported. If that weren&amp;#8217;t enough, it&amp;#8217;s the second fake money claim to hit Wachovia in recent weeks; the bank was forced to refund $40 to another person who received counterfeit bills during a transaction. One hopes the origin of the fake bills is a mischievous customer and not the bank itself. With all its other headaches, that&amp;#8217;s one scandal Wachovia simply does not need.
