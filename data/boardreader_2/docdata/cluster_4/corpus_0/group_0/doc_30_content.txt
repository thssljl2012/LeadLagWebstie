If you don't want to hear a barage of cussing and negativity...then click the fuck out of this blog.&amp;nbsp;  On the 1st of July, I put a deposit of $375 CASH into my bank account.&amp;nbsp; CASH.&amp;nbsp; Not a check.&amp;nbsp; CASH.&amp;nbsp; Did you catch this...CASH.&amp;nbsp; This was at 4:15 in the afternoon.&amp;nbsp; Then I proceeded to pay my cell phone bill, I went to the grocery, I put gas in my car and I went to Target to buy a tube of damn lipstick because I was LITERALLY scraping out the lipstick that was down inside the tube because I was THAT out of makeup.&amp;nbsp; I digress... I called the moment that I put in that money, because Bank of America has a history of having a much different balance than what I have in my ledger.&amp;nbsp; The balance stated that it was $389.11.&amp;nbsp; So I went forward with all of my bill paying.&amp;nbsp; I got home, logged on to my bank account online, and my bills had taken me down to $144.&amp;nbsp; Boo ya.&amp;nbsp; I have positive money.&amp;nbsp; So then I get the kids together, go to Gibson's game and then come home to check my email and find that Bank of America has sent me a low balance notification.&amp;nbsp; WHAT THE FUCK?&amp;nbsp; I had not spent a dime from the time I left this house to go to Gibson's game and then home again.&amp;nbsp;  I logged on to my account again, I am now -$30.43.&amp;nbsp; NEGATIVE.&amp;nbsp; And to make things worse, my CASH transaction was still fucking pending eighteen damn hours later.&amp;nbsp; My CASH deposit was still pending 18 hours after I deposited it.&amp;nbsp; I thought for sure that this had to be a bank error, as they also had given me FIVE fucking overdrafts when my account was never in the negative.&amp;nbsp; Never.&amp;nbsp; Not even for a second.&amp;nbsp;  So I called the bank.&amp;nbsp; They were unapologetic and stated that it was "their policy" to hold cash when it was deposited after business hours.&amp;nbsp; Be that as it may....I deposited that money at 4:15pm on Tuesday and by 10:00pm on Wedensday my CASH still hadn't "cleared".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So there was nothing that could be done over the phone.&amp;nbsp;  I had a mini nervous breakdown, I'm sure of it.&amp;nbsp; It was so bad I had to call Chip at 10:30 to come over because I was inconsolable.&amp;nbsp; He was wonderful.&amp;nbsp; He held me and kissed me and made me feel like I wasn't alone.&amp;nbsp;  So this morning I got up, printed out my bank records and went down to the bank.&amp;nbsp; In no way shape or form did I anticipate what was coming.&amp;nbsp; The man that I talked to was so nice to me and stated that he understood why I was so upset and that it was unfair to draft overdrafts for transactions that incurred AFTER a deposit.&amp;nbsp; The manager that I spoke to was a raging bitch and told me that not only are they going to assess those five, but that SIX FUCKING MORE were coming because the overdrafts that were on the account at that moment were from previous items.&amp;nbsp; I showed her my statement and asked her to point it out to me where my acount had gone in the negative, because every single number that I saw was positive.&amp;nbsp; She then got flustered and said "You just don't understand.&amp;nbsp; Your account will be assessed eleven overdrafts and there is nothing that I can do about it."&amp;nbsp; So I looked right at her and said, "Then give me my money, because this is the last day that I am going to bank with you."&amp;nbsp;  She smiled this sickly sweet smile and said, "That's just fine...you are a small level account and we will not suffer without your business."&amp;nbsp; I'm not fucking kidding you.&amp;nbsp; I almost choked.&amp;nbsp; I just looked at her and said, "I'd like my money and to be walking out that door in five minutes." I was so proud of myself.&amp;nbsp; I didn't lose my cool.&amp;nbsp; I actually didn't even cry.&amp;nbsp; I pled my case and got the ultimate FUCK YOU in the amount of $385.&amp;nbsp;  I took the money that I withdrew and I went straight to Great Southern.&amp;nbsp; I don't know if I can control that account any better than I can the one at Bank of America, but I had very specific questions about how they process their deposits and how quickly funds are available after deposit.&amp;nbsp; Fuck Bank of America.&amp;nbsp; They have plenty enough of MY damn money. I don't know how I am going to regroup from this.&amp;nbsp; All I know is that for tonight, I am going to go out with my friend Heather.&amp;nbsp; We are going to go have a girls night.&amp;nbsp; We are going out to dinner.&amp;nbsp; We are going to laugh and joke and we are going to enjoy being there for each other.&amp;nbsp; I am going to spend the weekend with the most amazing man that I know and I am going to love him every single second that I can.&amp;nbsp; I am going to enjoy my most favorite holiday of the entire year and I am going to say with great authority...FUCK BANK OF AMERICA.&amp;nbsp;
