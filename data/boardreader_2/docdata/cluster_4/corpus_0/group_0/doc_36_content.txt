 Im beginning to think so. And this guy has already determined that they do. (check out his site.)     I recently established a Bank of America checking account. (by recently I mean in the past eight months) Anyway, for years and years, I had maintained an account at a fairly small bank. They are  established, but not growing like a weed.  I moved, and circumstances led me to BOA.       I had been previously warned,  by a few people, that Bank of America had screwed them in some way or another, but I didnt heed their warnings.       Now, this week, I have spent numerous hours on the phone with them dealing with less than friendly customer service representatives trying to get unwarranted fines taken off my account.      I think the problem is finally solved, but my experience with them has been horrendous.  Its like they get the rudest people with the biggest chips on their shoulders, and hire them to represent the company.      While scouring the web I found many stories of people in similar, or worse situations with Bank Of America.      Tell me, have you ever had an issue with BOA?   And are you happy with your current banks policies, and customer service?
