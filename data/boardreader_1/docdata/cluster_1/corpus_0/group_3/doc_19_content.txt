Please take the time to sign this letter. Let Washington know we are fed up and we are not stupid!Dear Friend,Two weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Paulson bailed out American Insurance Group (AIG) with $85 billion dollars in taxpayer money.With this money, AIG executives headed out on a taxpayer funded junket to the St. Regis resort in California. While there, they had a blast at our expense. Join me in sending this message to Secretary Paulson:"The Director who authorized this junket should be fired and every penny spent on this lavish retreat must be returned to the Treasury." http://act.truemajorityaction.org/p/7002/campaign?campaign_KEY=1553
