 Just days&amp;#8212;days&amp;#8212;after the US government bailed out AIG to the tune of US$85 billion and the US citizenry collectively entered the insurance business, AIG executives headed to the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, CA. While there, the company&amp;#8217;s executives ran up a US$440,000 bill&amp;#8212;US$200,000 for rooms, US$150,000 for meals, and US$23,000 for the spa. The royal we wonder where the remaining US$67,000 went, but that&amp;#8217;s what imaginations are for.   Representative Henry Waxman (D-California) totaled up the figures in today&amp;#8217;s House of Representatives committee hearing about AIG&amp;#8217;s close call with the financial reaper. &amp;#8220;Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation,&amp;#8221; Waxman said.   Sadly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, AIG executives continue to draw multimillion-dollar paychecks. In fact, documents provided by AIG to Waxman&amp;#8217;s committee indicate that &amp;#8220;as the company&amp;#8217;s risky investments began to implode, the company altered its generous executive pay plan to pay out regardless of such losses,&amp;#8221; according to Peter Whoriskey&amp;#8217;s Washington Post account. In March, after having lost more than US$5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007, AIG chief executive Martin Sullivan urged the company&amp;#8217;s compensation committee to &amp;#8220;ignore those losses&amp;#8221; and award bonuses. Which, of course, it did, awarding Sullivan a cash bonus in excess of US$5 million and a golden parachute of US$15 million.   Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.   Update: Thursday, 09 October 2008 05:37AM CDT: On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve announced that it would lend AIG an additional US$37.8 billion. Sigh.
