     Have any of you read what has come out of the AIG Congressional hearings?&amp;nbsp; Well if you haven't, the basic jist of it is that a week after AIG received $85 BILLION from you, me, and the rest of the citizenry of this country, the executives decided to treat themselves to a vacation.&amp;nbsp; A vacation that cost $400,000+.&amp;nbsp; From Speaker.gov, here's Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) on the AIG manicure, etc., expenditures:  Have you heard of anything more outrageous - a week after taxpayers commit $85 billion dollars to rescue AIG, the company's leading insurance executives spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at one of the most exclusive reports in the nation...Let me describe for some of you the charges that the shareholders, taxpayers, had to pay. AIG spent $200,000 dollars for hotel rooms. Almost $150,000 for catered banquets. AIG spent $23,000 at the hotel spa and another $1,400 at the salon. They were getting manicures, facials, pedicures and massages while American people were footing the bill. And they spent another $10,000 dollars for I don't know what this is, leisure dining. Bars?As far as I'm concerned, these people have embezzeled money and should be punished.&amp;nbsp; They should be stripped of all their wealth and that wealth should be redistributed to the people.&amp;nbsp; The deserve to lose everything they have and live the remainder of their lives penniless, jobless, and reviled.&amp;nbsp;   You know, the French had this problem once, and a particular innovation during the enlightenment in humane termination of life helped them solve this kind of bullshit.&amp;nbsp;
