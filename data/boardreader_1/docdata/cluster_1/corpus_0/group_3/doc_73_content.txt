Committee Holds Hearing on the Causes and Effects of the AIG Bailout Chairman Waxman's Opening Statement  Today we are holding our second day of hearings on the financial crisis on Wall Street.  Yesterday, we examined the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Our focus today is AIG.  There are obvious differences between Lehman and AIG. Lehman is an investment bank; AIG is an insurance company. Lehman fell because it placed highly leveraged bets in the subprime and real estate markets; AIGs problems originate in complex derivatives called credit default swaps.  But their stories are fundamentally the same. In each case, the companies and their executives grew rich by taking on excessive risk. In each case, the companies collapsed when these risks turned bad. And in each case, their executives are walking away with millions of dollars while taxpayers are stuck with billions of dollars in costs.  The AIG CEOs are like the Lehman CEO in one other key respect: in each case, they refuse to accept any blame for what happened to their companies. http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=2214  *  *  *  *  *  *  AIG Spa Trip Fuels Fury on Hill Pressing Executives to Concede Mistakes, Lawmakers Blast Them About Bonuses  For some people at AIG, the insurance giant rescued last month with an $85 billion federal bailout, the good times keep rolling.  Joseph Cassano, the financial products manager whose complex investments led to American International Group's near collapse, is receiving $1 million a month in consulting fees.  Former chief executive Martin J. Sullivan, whose three-year tenure coincided with much of the company's ill-fated risk-taking, is receiving a $5 million performance bonus.  And just last week, about 70 of the company's top performers were rewarded with a week-long stay at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., where they ran up a tab of $440,000.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100702604.html?sid=ST2styleshhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100702604.html?sid=ST2styleshhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/20         posted in    ! * POLITICS * !    - 2 replies
