Two weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Paulson bailed out American Insurance Group (AIG) with $85 billion dollars in taxpayer money - and now they are back for more. He said they needed it to stay afloat. Now, we know what they did with our money. AIG executives headed out on a taxpayer funded junket to the St. Regis resort in California. While there, they had a blast at our expense. They helped themselves to:   $201,047.42 for hotel rooms and $147,301.71 for catered banquets  $23,380 for the hotel spa and another $1,488 for the salon.  Golf for $6,939.09 and $5,016.32 spent at the Tavern.  Now they are back at the trough. This is outrageous. Tell Treasury Secretary Paulson: The Director who authorized this junket should be fired and every penny spent on this lavish retreat must be returned to the Treasury. GO HERE: Send a message to Secretary Paulson right now Our government needs to be involved in restoring the economy. We need an economic recovery package for Main Street instead of more giveaways to Secretary Paulson's buddies on Wall Street. These bailouts are the last money grab by the Bush Administration on their way out of office. It's on us to provide oversight and make sure taxpayer money isn't wasted.
