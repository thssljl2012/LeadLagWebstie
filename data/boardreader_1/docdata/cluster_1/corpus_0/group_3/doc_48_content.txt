Elijah Cummings (D-MD).  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;This unbridled greed,&amp;quot; said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), &amp;quot;it's an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars.&amp;quot;  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Appearing before the committee, Martin Sullivan, the AIG CEO until June, said the company was overwhelmed by a &amp;quot;financial global tsunami,&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;no simple or single cause&amp;quot; was to blame.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;I am heartbroken at what has happened,&amp;quot; Sullivan said.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Robert Willumstad, the CEO from June to September, 2008, maintained AIG was a victim of a &amp;quot;crisis in confidence&amp;quot; and an &amp;quot;unprecedented global catastrophe.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Through the first week of September we were confident AIG could weather the crisis,&amp;quot; Willumstad testified. He said the federal government offered its $85 million bail out on the afternoon it prepared for bankruptcy. Willumstad said the Federal Reserve demanded he resign, and will turn down his AIG retirement package of several million dollars.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;But Congressional investigators raised question of &amp;quot;mismanagement&amp;quot; and whether AIG executives sought to &amp;quot;cook the books&amp;quot; and hide negative information from outside auditors.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;On Dec. 5, 2007, Waxman said, CEO Sullivan told investors, &amp;quot;We are confident in our marks and the reasonableness of our valuation methods.&amp;quot;  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Documents obtained by the committee show that one week earlier, auditors Pricewaterhouse Cooper had &amp;quot;raise their concerns with Mr. Sullivan&amp;amp;informing him that PWC believed that AIG could have a material weakness relating to the risk management of these areas.&amp;quot;  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;In March, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision wrote AIG, &amp;quot;We are concerned that the corporate oversight of AIG Financial Products&amp;amp;lacks critical elements of independence, transparency, and granularity.&amp;quot;  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Asked about the letter by the committee, the SEC's former chief accountant, Lynn Turner, said the letter reflects &amp;quot;a serious problem from the top down of management, that can bring an organization down.&amp;quot;  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Former AIG CEO Sullivan said accounting rules required AIG to mark down the value of its holdings, even though it had no plans to sell them, the &amp;quot;mark to market&amp;quot; provision.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;AIG had to sell at &amp;quot;fire sale prices,&amp;quot; he told skeptical members of Congress. &amp;quot;Suddenly a company with a trillion dollars in assets&amp;quot; was in trouble, said Sullivan.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Waxman questioned both former CEOs about a former AIG auditor who claimed he had been blocked from reviewing the books of a London-based division that has since been blamed for a large share of the company's downfall.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Former CEO Willumstad, chairman of the AIG board at the time, said &amp;quot;I honestly don't remember&amp;quot; the concerns raised by the former auditor.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;I find that very disturbing,&amp;quot; said Congressman Waxman.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Waxman also said there is evidence the two men changed the bonus schedule once the company began to post losses, so that executives under the &amp;quot;Senior Partners Plan&amp;quot; would continue to make multi-million dollar salaries.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;Mr. Sullivan and the other top executives should have had their bonuses slashed due to poor performance,&amp;quot; said Waxman.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Sullivan said it was &amp;quot;substantially reduced&amp;quot; by the board in 2007 due to poor performance.  &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Sullivan was given a $15 million &amp;quot;golden parachute&amp;quot; payment after being replaced as CEO in June. &amp;#0160; This photo accurately reflects my sentiments...
