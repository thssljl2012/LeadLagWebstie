Is it any wonder after all the trauma that AIG has been suffering that their executives need to get away from it all? Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today. &amp;#8220;Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night,&amp;#8221; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs. AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#8217;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges. &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;#8221; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD). &amp;#8220;This unbridled greed,&amp;#8221; said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars.&amp;#8221; After all, why worry about the cost when Uncle Sam is picking up the tab? This reminds me of this, metaphorically speaking. Nice Work If You Can Get It    Post from: Democracy for Vancouver Our Tax Dollars At Work
