Prudential pulls out of AIA auction - LONDON (LONDON) British insurer Prudential has pulled out of the auction for the Asian business of troubled American insurer AIG, The Sunday Times newspaper reported. The paper said Prudential chief executive Mark Tucker believes the asking price of pounds;7 billion (S$15.24 billion) for American International Assurance Co (AIA) was too high. AIA has said that it remains &#8216;financially strong&#8217; even after an economic slowdown in the region weakened demand for insurance products. The AIA group had a combined solvency ratio of more than 200 per cent of the regulatory requirement as at Nov 30, the company said yesterday. Total assets are currently more than US$60 billion, it said, without providing earlier figures. AIG agreed to place AIA and American Life Insurance Co into trusts to pay down its federal credit line. The insurer last month put together all its AIA units in the Asia-Pacific region to form the AIA group. The AIA group hired more than 52,000 new agents last year, according to the statement. It has 20 million customers in Asia. AIG, which received another bailout from American taxpayers last week, has put its Asian arm up for sale to raise up to US$20 billion.  AIG&#8217;s valuation of the business was based on a Watson Wyatt report published last summer, before the full extent of the global recession was apparent, the paper said. &#8212; Reuters  Source : Business Times - 9 Mar 2009 Singapore Property - Buy, Sell, Rent, Invest Mindy Yong (+65)91002985 mindy@mindyyong.com
