               One AIG headline in each of New York City's two quality newspapers.The WSJ: "AIG's Rivals Blame Bailout For Tilting Insurance Game"The New York Times: "At A.I.G., the Brand Is Tarnished"Which I guess means they cancel each other out, only you still shouldn't be seen in public with any AIG merch (can I keep my AIG Highstar discount mini-Maglite?).
