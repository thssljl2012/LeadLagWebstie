 Authors: Nishith Srivastava &amp; Akash RakyanThailand is the 2nd largest economy in Southeast Asia, after Indonesia. It ranks midway in the wealth spread in South East Asia and is the 4th richest nation per capita, after Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia. The Thai economy in 2008 is forecasted to grow at 5.6% (in the forecasted range of 5.0-6.0%). This figure is an improvement on 4.8% growth in the previous year according to Fiscal Policy Office (FPO), Ministry of Finance. In 2008 accelerated public sector spending led to recovery in domestic demand which is expected to be far more balanced economic expansion. Government policy would then be forced to stimulate the domestic economy. This happens when external demand is likely to be softened from possible global economic slowdown. External stability in 2008 will remain strong with current account surplus estimated to be 0.5% of GDP (in the range of 0.3-0.8% of GDP). In contrast, internal stability in 2008 may have some risk with increasing headline inflation at 4.5% (in a range of 4.3-4.8%). This is mainly due to rising energy and food prices in the world markets. According to The Economist, real GDP growth will slow down by 1.15% p.a over the next 4 years (2008-12), as compared to 5.3% p.a in past 3 years since 2007. This sluggishness of GDP can be attributed to various negative factors, such as political uncertainty, instability of foreign exchange rates, and continuous high petroleum prices in 2006. The Thai insurance industry, along with the wider Thai economy, has now however recovered from the depths of the Asian financial crisis and is experiencing noteworthy growth. The trend is expected to continue as public awareness of the need for insurance increases.Market Performance and ForecastWithin a span of 7 years (2000-2007), Thai Insurance Sector has experienced a growth of 191% currently valuated at $9,434.72 million.
