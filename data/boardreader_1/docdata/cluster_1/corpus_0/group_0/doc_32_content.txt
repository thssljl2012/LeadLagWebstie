            AmTrustDirect just increased the rates on many of its online CDs. The 12-month CD yield increased from 4.15% to 4.30% APY. The yield for all the longer terms is now 4.35% APY (up from 4.25%). It was just last week when AmTrustDirect raised its 12-month CD yield to 4.15% APY.Perhaps the CD promotions from major banks like Bank of America, Wachovia and WaMu are having an effect on smaller banks like AmTrust. The competition is helping to push rates higher.One thing that annoyed me with AmTrustDirect is their recent e-Savings Account promotion. At first look of their e-Savings Account page, it appears the rate is 3.50% APY for everyone. However, if you read the small print, you'll find that this only applies to new accounts for the first 90 days. For those with existing e-Savings account, you'll only earn the standard rate of 2.50% APY. When I called on Monday for more information, I was told existing e-Savings customers may be able to get this rate if they call and ask for a retention offer.In my opinion, this e-Savings page is a little deceptive. A good example of how to specify a promo rate is EverBank's home page. It clearly presents both the intro rate and the ongoing rate.Please see my June review of AmTrustDirect CDs for more details about the CDs and AmTrustDirect's financial health. AmTrust has been hit hard by the mortgage crisis. As I recommend with any bank, make sure you stay below the FDIC insurance limits (AmTrust FDIC Certificate # 29776).Thanks to the reader who mentioned this new one-year CD rate in the Finding the Best Deals post.Labels: AmTrustDirect, banks, certificates of deposit, large deposits, nationally available
