            Quick Link for Rates, Recap of this week's postsCD rates continued to increase this week. On my list I now have 10 banks with yields at 5% or higher for 5-year CDs and 11 banks with yields at 4% or higher for 12-month CDs. Wachovia still has the best short and long CD term rates. Indymac Bank had a busy week with many CD rate changes. They ended the week with some high CD rates including a 4.40% APY 13-month CD. Two small banks that aren't covered much have some short term CDs that are close to what Wachovia is offering. One is Century Bank Direct which is offering a 4.02% APY 10-month CD and a 4.11% APY 15-month CD. For simplicity, I've included this 15-month CD in my 12-month CD list. The other small bank is Crestmark which is offering excellent short term rates on its CDs. It leads my 3-month rate list with a 3.95% APY CD. Its 6 and 9-month CDs are at 4.00% APY, and its 12-month CD is at 4.20% APY.Unfortunately, savings account rates are not moving up like CD rates. The last non-promo 4% savings account ended this week when Alliant Credit Union lowered its savings account rate from 4.00% to 3.75% APY.On the positive side, EverBank made a big increase on its 3-month intro rate for its checking and money market account. The 3-month yield is now 4.76% APY (up from 4.01%). This applies to the first $100K of the checking account or the first $50K of the money market account. You have to be a new customer. EverBank also raised the ongoing rates of these accounts. The ongoing rate of the money market account is now a very competitive 3.51% APY.For reward checking accounts, I posted on a new one that's available nationwide. It's at West Bank, the same bank that holds deposits for SmartyPig. The reward checking yield is only 5.00% APY, but the cap is a nice $50,000. Reward checking accounts with a high cap and a high yield are becoming rare.For my full list of reward checking accounts, please refer to my High Yield Checking website.Recap for the Week - Links to This Week's PostsBanking NewsBank of America Completes Acquisition of CountrywideSavings and Money Market Deals - NationalE*TRADE Bank Raises Yield on Complete Savings AccountChecking Account Changes at Bank of Internet USAEverBank Raises Checking and Money Market Account RatesIt's Official - Alliant Credit Union Cuts Savings Account Rate to 3.75%CD Deals - National4.00% 12-Month / 3.60% 8-Month Online CDs at WaMuNew Rates Again at Indymac Bank - 4.40% 13-Month CD5.15% 60-Month / 4.20% 18-Month CD at OnBank - Nationally Available4.20% 12-Month / 4.00% 6-Month CD at Crestmark Bank - Nationally AvailableDiscover Bank Raises CD Rates, 5.17% 60-Month / 4.02% 12-Month CDUmbrellaBank Raises CD RatesIndymac Bank's CD Rate Increase and Latest News4.00% 7-Month CD at Premier America Credit Union - Easy Membership4.45% 24-Month Online CD at Huntington BankChecking/Savings Account BonusesiPod nano Checking Account Promotion at KeyBankReward Checking Accounts5.00% Reward Checking Account at an Iowa Bank - Available Nationwide (West Bank)5.01% Reward Checking Account at a New Jersey Credit Union (Pinnacle)5.01% Reward Checking Account at a Louisiana Bank (St. Martin Bank &amp;amp; Trust Company)4.25% Reward Checking Account at a Hawaii CU (Hawaii USA)CD and Money Market Deals - Local5.00% 60-Month CD at a Multi-State Bank (First Republic)4.10% 10-Month CD at a California Bank (Canyon National)4.00% 8-Month / 4.25% 18-Month CD at an OR/WA Credit Union (NW Priority)4.70% 12-Month CD at a Utah Bank (Cache Valley)5.12% 60-Month / 4.08% 12-Month CD at a Florida Bank (Peninsula)4.35% 11-Month / 4.35% 23-Month CD at a Florida Bank (Peoples First Community)5.00% 60-Month CD at TD Commerce Bank4.00% 4-Month CD at AL/GA/FL/TX/NV Bank (Colonial)4.00% 9-Month CD at a Florida Bank (BankFIRST)4.01% 7-Month CD at an Oregon CU (Northwest Community)5.00% 60-Month / 4.00% 14-Month CD at MI/WI/OH Bank (Citizens)4.00% 12-Month CD at a Chicago Bank (Builders)4.00% 9-Month CD at a Michigan CU (Lenco)4.25% 19-Month CD at a Georgia Bank (Savannah)5.25% 48-Month / 4.55% 23-Month CD at KeyBank5.15% 60-Month / 4.40% 24-Month CD at a Virginia CU (Northwest) EXPIRED4.25% 10-Month / 4.25% 13-Month CD at an Illinois Bank (Western Springs National Bank &amp;amp; Trust)4.25% 17-Month / 4.00% 11-Month CD at a Pennsylvania Bank (Lafayette Ambassador)The rates listed below are based on Annual Percentage Yield (APY). No minimum balances are required unless noted. MMA next to the rates indicate a money market account. Most MMAs have check writing and ATM cards. Online savings accounts usually lack both of these.
