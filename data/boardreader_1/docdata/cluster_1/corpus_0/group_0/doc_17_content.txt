            Quick Link for Rates, Recap of this week's postsIn the last couple of days a few major banks have started some nice CD specials. Bank of America started offering a 4.11% APY for a 7-month Online High Yield CD (see post) and Countrywide Bank (which is now part of BofA) started a similar 7-month CD special with a 4.10% APY (see post). I just reported today on WaMu's new Online CD special: 4.25% APY for 8 and 12-month terms (see post). There was also some good news regarding Wachovia. Its high yield Featured CDs have been extended. So you also have the option of several competitive rates at Wachovia with yields ranging from 4% APY for a 7-month term to 5.25% APY for a 60-month term (see post).These high yield CDs from the major banks should put pressure on all the other banks and credit unions to make similar rate hikes. We saw some of that this week with CD rate increases at AmTrustDirect, Imperial Capital, Greystone and ISN Bank. All of these banks have some very competitive short-term CD rates. I would expect seeing more CD deals from banks like these next week.Why are we seeing the higher CD rates? There continues to be expectations of higher rates in the future to combat inflation. With the shaky financial markets and the potential for a serious recession, there is some speculation that the Fed may delay hiking rates until next year. However, as this Bloomberg article reported, the Fed may place more importance on keeping inflation in check. So we may start to see Fed rate hikes by the end of the year. Another reason for the higher CD rates may be the need for capital. As this BestCashCow article described, the credit crisis has ruined securitization, and thus, this is forcing banks to bring in more deposits.Savings Account RatesUnfortunately, we're not seeing the banks raise their savings account rates like they have been with their CD rates. Several banks lowered their savings and money market account rates this week. Here's a summary of the rate cuts:OneUnited: 3.60% to 3.26%1st Constitution Direct 3mo promo: 4% to 3.90%Corus Bank: 3.62% to 3.56%Amegy Bank: 3.55% to 3.50%Zions Bank: 3.53% to 3.45%AARP Financial Savings Center: 3.50% to 3.45%E*TRADE MaxRate Checking: 3.25% to 3.01%UFB Direct: 3.01% to 2.96%There were a couple of banks that increased their savings account rates. However, the new rates just put them in the upper end of the middle of the pack:AmTrustDirect: 2.50% to 3.50%Nationwide: 3.35% to 3.50%Note, the rate increase was on AmTrustDirect's e-Savings and not its e-Money Market Account which continues to have very low rates.Savings Accounts with Rate GuaranteesThe downside to savings accounts is that they typically don't guarantee the rate will last. There continues to be a few promotions that do provide a short guarantee. The best national one continues to be EverBank with its 4.76% APY 3-month guarantee for new checking and money market accounts (see post).I came across an even better one this week, but it's only a local deal. It's at the Bank of the Carolinas, and the bank is guaranteeing a yield of 4% APY on balances over $10K on its money market account until 6/30/09 (see post).Highest Yield Reward Checking Account Available NationwideFor those who want liquidity and a high yield bank account, at least there's the reward checking account. This week I added another reward checking account to my nationally available list. The one unique thing about this reward checking account is the yield: 7.01% APY for all balances up to $25,000. It's from the MidAmerica West Federal Credit Union. I first posted on this 7% reward checking account in February 2008. At that time eligibility to join the credit union seemed to be limited, but a reader recently found an association that anyone can join to qualify for credit union membership (see post). As is typical, there is no guarantee this rate will last (although it has lasted for most of this year).For my full list of reward checking accounts, please refer to my High Yield Checking website.Recap for the Week - Links to This Week's PostsBanking NewsFDIC's Website to Assist Indymac Depositors on Insurance CoverageLists of America's Most Troubled BanksFDIC-Insured Deposits over $100K and Other Ways to be InsuredReview of the Latest News on Indymac's ClosureFeds Try to Calm Worries with Sunday AnnouncementsSavings and Money Market Deals - NationalHigher Yield and New-Account Bonus for Nationwide's Money Market AccountNew Online Savings Account at Union Federal Savings BankCapital One Savings Account and CD Review for Costco MembersCD Deals - National4.25% 8-Month and 12-Month Online CDs at WaMuWachovia's High Yield Featured CDs Have Been ExtendedCountrywide Bank's 4.10% 7-Month CD Special4.11% 7-Month High Yield CD at Bank of AmericaHigher CD Rates at GMAC Bank Plus News on the FDIC WaiverImperial Capital Bank's 4% 9-Month CD and iChecking Accounts4.45% 24-Month CD at Charles Schwab EXPIRED4.15% 12-Month / 3.80% 6-Month CD at Greystone Bank - Nationally Available4.10% 6-Month CD at ISN Bank - Nationally AvailableAmTrustDirect Raises CD Rates, 12-Month CD Yield is Now 4.15%Update on Wachovia CD and Money Market Account PromotionsHigh CD Rates Are Not Over at IndymacChecking/Savings Account BonusesiPod nano Checking Account Bonus at a California CU (Valley)$50 Checking Account Bonus at FirstBankiPod nano Checking Account Promotion at KeyBankReward Checking AccountsUpdate on MidWest America FCU's 7.01% Reward Checking Account5.00% Reward Checking Account at a Missouri Bank - with bonuses (Liberty)4.50% Reward Checking Account at Bank of the Carolinas5.50% Reward Checking Account at a Texas Credit Union (Beacon)CD and Money Market Deals - Local3.50% Savings Account Guaranteed Through 2008 at a MA Bank (Hyde Park Savings)4.30% 12-Month / 4.15% 6-Month CD at a California Bank (Community Banks of Northern California)5.00% 60-Month CD at a Georgia Credit Union (Georgia Heritage)4.08% 6-Month CD at a California Bank (Gateway Business)5.01% 48-Month CD at a Washington State Credit Union (Gesa)4.00% Money Market Account Guaranteed to 6/30/09 at Bank of the Carolinas4.25% 7-Month CD at a Colorado Credit Union (Ent)Capital One CD and Money Market Promotions in Texas4.18% 6-Month / 4.18% 24-Month CD at a Florida CU (South Florida)4.00% 6-Month / 4.50 18-Month CD at a Nevada Bank - and Reward Checking (Community Bank of Nevada)4.00% 7-Month / 5.00% 60-Month CD at a Florida Bank (Sunshine State Community)4.25% 12-Month CD at a Maryland Bank (Hopkins Federal Savings) EXPIRED4.00% 9-Month CD at a Pennsylvania Credit Union (Police and Fire)4.00% 6-Month / 4.50 18-Month CD at an Arizona Bank (Community Bank of Arizona)4.00% 11-Month / 4.75% 36-Month CD at a Chicago Bank (Cole Taylor)4.25% 13-Month / 4.00% 7-Month CD at a Texas Bank (Franklin)5.15% 36-Month / 5.15% 60-Month CD at a Connecticut Bank (Naugatuck Valley Savings and Loan)4.10% 12-Month CD at a California Bank (Universal)5.05% 43-Month CD at National City Bank4.15% 6-Month CD at a Colorado Bank (Vectra)4.00% 9-Month CD at a California Bank (Downey Savings) EXPIRED4.25% 6-Month / 4.35% 12-Month CD at a New Jersey Bank (RomAsia)The rates listed below are based on Annual Percentage Yield (APY).
