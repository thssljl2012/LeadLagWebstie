&amp;#8230;If the insurance business was heavily involved in OSS covert operations during World War II, it is most definitely NOT a leap of logic to suspect that the world&amp;#8217;s biggest insurer today (AIG) is also heavily involved in them. This is particularly the case when you consider that, as the L.A. Times article explained, the man who ran the OSS&amp;#8217;s insurance intel unit is the same man who established AIG. What exactly the insurance related covert operations currently involve I (obviously) don&amp;#8217;t know. It stands to reason, however, that whatever they do involve, a bankruptcy of the world&amp;#8217;s biggest insurer would likely be very disruptive to them. In other words, the federal government was probably *extremely* motivated to save AIG for reasons that aren&amp;#8217;t going to be acknowledged in the mainstream or alternative press. Hopefully this puts the bailout of AIG in a bit more perspective. Full: http://aconstantineblacklist.blogspot.com/2008/11/bailout-of-aig-cia-covert-operations.html
