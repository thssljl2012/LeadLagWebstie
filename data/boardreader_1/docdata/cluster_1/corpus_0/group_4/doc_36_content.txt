The Metropolitan Transit Authority joined 10 other transit agencies across the nation on Tuesday as they urged Congress for help with financing deals imperiled by the credit crisis.The move is the latest attempt by Metro and the other agencies to avoid millions in default payments triggered by the collapse of insurance giant American International Group.AIG provided payment guarantees on lease agreements between Metro and several banks. Those deals required payment guarantees from insurers, such as AIG, with high credit ratings. The deals guaranteed by AIG now are in technical default as a result of the insurance giant's slashed credit rating.Metro could be on the hook for about $14 million, roughly the amount in revenue it earned from the deals, officials have said.AIG insured most of the deals and Bank of America has agreed to allow Metro until Dec. 1 to find another insurer.full article
