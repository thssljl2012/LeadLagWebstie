                Even as well documented, outrageous expenses have come to light, the Feds still see no problem with continuing to dump taxpayer's money into insurance giant AIG.WASHINGTON   The government on Monday provided new financial assistance to troubled insurance giant American International Group, including pouring $40 billion into the company in return for partial ownership.The action, announced jointly by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, was taken as it became increasingly clear that an original financial lifeline thrown to AIG in September would not be sufficient to stabilize the teetering company. All told, the moves boost aid to the company to around $150 billion.The $40 billion infusion comes from the recently enacted $700 billion financial bailout package. The government is buying preferred shares of AIG stock, giving taxpayers an ownership stake in the company.This comes on top of a report this morning of the Feds refusing to identify recipients of nearly $2 trillion of taxpayer's money.
