RBI has taken certain measurespost Lehman bankruptcy. Lehman Brothers has 2 outfits in India -   Lehman Brothers Capital Pvt. Ltd. (NBFC)   Lehman Brothers Fixed Income Securities Pvt. Ltd. (a primary dealer)   RBI has asked Lehman Brothers Capital Pvt. Ltd. to take permission from RBI before taking any direct/indirect liability from any institution in India or making any forex remittance. It has asked Lehman Brothers Fixed Income Securities Pvt. Ltd not to undertake any transactions in G-sec market. As I posteda while back, Barclays has only brought North American operations. The other worldwide businesses are still in Lehman. So, till Lehman findsa buyer for its worldwide businesses as well, we might expect these measures in other economies as well.
