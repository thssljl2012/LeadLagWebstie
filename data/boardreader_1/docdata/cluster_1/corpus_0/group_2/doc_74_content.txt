Because the cost of health insurance is on the increase nationwide, residents of Alabama are also in a desperate search for low cost health insurance. However, it is wise to bear in mind the fact that not everything out there qualifies as health insurance. I'll show you what they are and their true uses and what amounts to real Alabama health insurance. Finally, I will show you how you can make the most savings.Discount health care plans are great. However they should never be looked at as an alternative to health insurance -- They are only supplemental in nature. Here are a few reasons...1) You are still responsible for all medical bills you incur. They, however, provide medical discount services.2) The Alabama Department of Insurance does not regulate these plans. This means that you're on your own if you have a dispute with an Alabama discount health provider. But if you get a real health insurance plan, you can rest assured that you'll have recourse from the Alabama Department of Insurance.Do these mean that Alabama discount services are worthless? Far from that. I'm just trying to put things in proper perspective. You can't get a discount health plan and wave good buy to an insurance health plan. If you can afford it, get both. Here's how you can save enough to get both without changing your budget...Hopefully you have other insurance policies: Auto, home, etc. Now, take out about 30 minutes to visit at least three insurance quotes sites and make sure you input the same information in all three. You'll get quotes from up to 5 A rated insurance companies if you use the right quotes sites.Do this for each policy: Auto, home, health and any other you already have. Compare your results. You'll see companies that offer comparable plans for less. Make sure you understand what is truly covered (You don't want to be shortchanged). Some lucky folks have been able to shave off a few thousand dollars from their insurance costs this way.Here are my favorite pages for health insurance quotes...InsureMe Health Insurance QuotesHealth Insurance QuotesPublishers can get unique versions of my articles by following any of the links above.
