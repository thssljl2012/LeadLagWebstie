Here is a link to the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations' web site: www.nolhga.com. There you can find information on subjects such as what happens when a Life or Health Insurance Company becomes insolvent, and how NOLHGA and State Insurance Guaranty Associatons protect Policyholders. And here is a link to the web site of the National Conference of Insurance Guaranty Funds: www.ncigf.org. They offer similar information involving Property and Casualty Insurance Companies.

See, e.g.,Ron LIeber and Tara Siegel Bernard, &amp;quot;Wall Street and You: Sorting Out the Changes in the Financial World&amp;quot; p. C6, col. 1 (New York Times Nat'l Ed., Tuesday, September 16, 2008) and Jeff Plungis, &amp;quot;AIG Bankruptcy May Put Consumers Under States' Care (Update 1)&amp;quot; (Bloomberg.com, Tuesday, September 16, 2008).
