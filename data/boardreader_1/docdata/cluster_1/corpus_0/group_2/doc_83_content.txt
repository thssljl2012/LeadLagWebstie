            Insurance regulator, IRDA   has asked the two Tata AIG insurance arms for some details pertaining to trouble at AIG globally.   The next 48 hours are extremely crucial in deciding the fate of Tata AIG life   and general insurance business. The Insurance Regulatory &amp; Development   Authority of India, or IRDA, has asked Tata AIG to provide an operational   status on both the life and general insurance operations, which is expected   in a day or two.           IRDA said there is not   much to worry about as of now, but their main concern is regarding the   solvency margins of insurance companies. As of now, they are quite comfortable in   that respect. IRDA sources said, they are keeping a close tab on developments   at Tata AIG.       As per the current FDI limit, AIG holds 26% in the joint venture.
