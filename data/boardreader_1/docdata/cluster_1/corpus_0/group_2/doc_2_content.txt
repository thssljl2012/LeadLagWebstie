I asked Glenn Cooke, who writes the Term Life Insurance Canada blog for his comment on what happens to life insurance policies sold by AIG in Canada, in the event of the parent company declaring bankruptcy (this was before the US government provided an $85 billion bridge loan in return for a 79.9% equity stake in the company). He pointed to a press release put out by AIG Life of Canada that policies held by its Canadian customers are safe and secure because the company is a separate legal entity with no exposure to assets that caused the credit crisis. Mr. Cooke also points out in that even if AIG Life of Canada fails, consumers are likely to be mostly protected. Another subsidiary of AIG provides mortgage insurance in Canada and it is unclear what, if any, effect the crisis will have on it. While AIG&amp;#8217;s fall might have little serious impact on consumers, it will be of great interest to investors. There is plenty of media coverage of but I found these two quite interesting: (1) The Globe and Mail explains how credit default swaps brought down the insurance giant. (2) Money magazine on the five common questions surrounding AIG.
