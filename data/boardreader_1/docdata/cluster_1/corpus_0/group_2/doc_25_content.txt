AIG is looking to sell assets, raise capital, and get a loan from the Fed after a deal to sell some businesses to private equity firms was voted down by the board this weekend (WSJ).  The company is facing a ratings downgrade which could increase its financing costs significantly.  The problem here is that AIG is so large, it needs a huge amount of capital to meet its needs.The company has said it is looking to sell its automotive and annuities businesses.  All in, the company is looking to raise $40-50 bln of new capital not counting the $20 bln it has already raised.  AIG's aircraft leasing arm, ILFC, and its stake in Blackstone could bring significant capital to the firm.  ILFC owns 900 aircraft worth $50 bln.  It is the largest single customer for Boeing and Airbus.  The company had operating income of $352 mln in Q2.  AIG's Blackstone stake is worth $700 mln and it has $1 bln invested in Blackstone funds.AIG may shift assets from its regulated insurance company to the holding company to ensure it has adequate cash to meet counterparty demands.  This is typically not easy to do as regulators want to ensure the insurance company is well capitalized. In addition to its financial problems, AIG could face significant claims from hurricane Ike.
