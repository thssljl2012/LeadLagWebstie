     ... AIG Run Into Ground by Pursuit of Greed, Deliberately Hidden Complexities. The headlines this morning tell the morning tale: Hugh Son and Erik Holm, &amp;quot;Fed Takes Control of AIG With $85 Billion Bailout (Update 1)&amp;quot; (Bloomberg.com, Wed., September 17, 2008); and Edmund L. Andrews, Michael J. de la Merced and Mary Williams Walsh, &amp;quot;Fed's $85 Billion Loan Rescues Insurer&amp;quot; (New York Times Online, Wed., September 17, 2008). It appears that AIG's woes were not caused by its Insurance operations. There is general agreement that AIG's Insurance subsidiaries are completely solvent. AIG is the world's largest Insurance organization. It achieved that status by making perhaps more money than any other Insurance Company had ever made in the history of the world. The problems of AIG were caused instead by the needs of its operators to make evenmore money. They may not have invented the deliberately complex financial instruments to hide the risk they were taking on, such as credit default swaps and collaterallized debt obligations, but the AIG &amp;quot;management&amp;quot; used them often. Too often. AIG is the famous Insurance Company that wanted to be a bank. The Federal bailout, by whatever name, reportedly has these features: --An $85 Billion loan to AIG for a two-year term; --79.9% of AIG's stock will be transferred to the Federal Government; and --&amp;quot;Management&amp;quot; of AIG will be replaced. So now you and I, fellow Federal Taxpayer, own AIG. Will we be asked to finance the golden bailout by subsidizing the departure of the &amp;quot;management&amp;quot; that caused us these difficulties? And who caused so manypeople so much pain? Here is another question: When and how much money is that &amp;quot;management&amp;quot; going to repay out of the money they already got while they ran AIG into the ground?
