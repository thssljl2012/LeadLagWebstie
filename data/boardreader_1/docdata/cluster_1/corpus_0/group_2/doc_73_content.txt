Last week I wondered aloud about how the Fed managed to get 20+ insurance departments to approve de facto take-overs in record time.  Since then I&amp;#8217;ve learned from semi-public sources that AIG&amp;#8217;s insurers and their assets are not part of the deal.  Apparently, they insurance companies we know as AIG are fully solvent.
