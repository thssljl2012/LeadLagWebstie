 Pretty old news now, but AIG bailed out on fears of systemic risks. From the WSJ; That the government would prop up AIG financially offers a stark indication of the breadth of the insurer&amp;#8217;s role in the global economy. If it were to have trouble meeting its obligations, the potential domino effect could reach around the world. For one thing, banks and mutual funds are major holders off AIG&amp;#8217;s debt and could take a hit if the insurer were to default. In addition, AIG was a major seller of &amp;#8220;credit-default swaps,&amp;#8221; essentially, insurance against default on assets tied to corporate debt and mortgage securities. Weakness at AIG could force financial institutions in the U.S., Europe and Asia that bought these swaps to take write-downs or losses. AIG&amp;#8217;s millions of insurance policyholders appear to be considerably less at risk. That&amp;#8217;s because of how the company is structured and regulated. Its insurance policies are issued by separate subsidiaries of AIG, highly regulated units that have assets available to pay claims. In the U.S., those assets can&amp;#8217;t be shifted out of the subsidiaries without regulatory approval, and insurance is also regulated strictly abroad.  Not really &amp;#8220;insurance&amp;#8221; problems. The problems stem rather from the financial services within the financial markets, insurance of MBS securities etc. As previously stated, what were their underwriters looking at? Surely they knew that &amp;#8220;No doc loans&amp;#8221; carried lots and lots of CREDIT RISK.
