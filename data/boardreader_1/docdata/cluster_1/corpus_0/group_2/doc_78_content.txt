&amp;nbsp; Last night on The Charlie Rose Show, Maurice (Hank) Greenberg pleaded for a federal bailout of American Internation Group (AIG), of which he is the major stockholder and former CEO. &amp;nbsp;Greenberg said part of the problem that caused the current financial crisis is that "there is no federal regulator of insurance." &amp;nbsp;He didn't say, "There is no option of a federal regulator, as there is with banks;" he said "There is no federal regulator." &amp;nbsp;He went on to say there ought to be a single federal regulator of insurance and recommended that Congress create a single federal regulator of the financial services industry&amp;#8212;the Fed&amp;#8212;which should include insurance.  &amp;nbsp; After the interview, the Fed nationalized AIG, seizing control of it under an obscure law passed in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash, announcing it would provide the company a two-year "bridge loan" of $85 billion in exchange for 80 percent of its stock in order to allow the insurance giant to sell off assets and raise capital. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The question is: &amp;nbsp;"Is this so-called "bridge loan" a bridge to a single federal regulator? &amp;nbsp;
