Mother Jones -Now that you, the American taxpayer, more or less own insurance giant AIG, it turns out that you, the American taxpayer, are also the principal sponsor of Manchester United, thanks to a four-year, $100 million sponsorship deal signed in 2006.Man U currently has a record of 1 win, 1 draw, and 1 loss.  Good for 4 points and 14th place in the League.  Isn't it ironic, the soccer team that is possibly the most well-known in the world is now being sponsored by the American Taxpayers.  It is only $50 Million.  A drop in the bucket according to our conservative friends.  What a boondoggle.
