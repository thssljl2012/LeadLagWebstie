The world sat spellbound as LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS, INC. (&amp;#8221;LEH&amp;#8221;) tried to get help from the U.S government and others, and even the most opportunistic of asset eating sharks swam away without biting the large, bloated, twitching corpse. LEH reports an interesting statistic on its voluntary petition for relief, under Chapter 11 of Title 11, United States Code (Bankruptcy Code for Chapter 11 cases); namely, in Exhibit &amp;#8220;A&amp;#8221; to the Petition, as of May 31, 2008, LEH reports, under penalty of perjury, having total assets of $639 Billion and total debts of $613 Billion. The LEH bankruptcy caused major disruption to financial markets worldwide, a fact that has been reported so many times, in one way and then in another, as to make citations unnecessary. It&amp;#8217;s beyond any meaningful dispute. In tandem was Merrill Lynch (&amp;#8221;MER&amp;#8221;), in a dance with Bank of America (&amp;#8221;BAC&amp;#8221;), for $50 Billion, a &amp;#8220;fire sale&amp;#8221; for what Kenneth Lewis said MER &amp;#8220;could weather&amp;#8221; on their own. Then sat the American Insurance Group (&amp;#8221;AIG&amp;#8221;), rebuffed by the FED for a bridge loan, partially medicated with New York State prior authority to borrow from its own subsidiaries, under assault from rating agencies. That would precipitate the need to put up something AIG was utterly drained of&amp;#8211;cash. AIG was bleeding and needed a transfusion to survive outside of Bankruptcy Court. Then the FED, by means of the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, meets with congressional leadership behind the scenes and all protocols dispensed with, the go ahead provided, loans&amp;#8211;not gives, mind you&amp;#8211;but loans&amp;#8211;AIG about $80 Billion, at 11.5%. The current discount rate is about 2% for member banks but AIG is an insurance conglomerate. Despite requiring that the loan be paid back plus interest, the additional consideration is a 79.9% interest in AIG itself to the U.S. Treasury. The United States Department of Justice put members of La Cosa Nostra in prison for such loansharking practices. So &amp;#8230; what gives? AIG is inter alia a behemoth property-casualty insurer. The exposure is worldwide, in what is reportedly over 130 countries. I do not have the time or data to break this all out yet but with one intuitive glance one can see that 80% ownership means 80% exposure to any existing insured risks. Property-Casualty risks include damage to personal and real property and businesses. That description is itself too narrow by a wide margin. It is unclear what AIG exposure is to typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fires, tornadoes, and the like. The property damage claims of Hurricane Katrina alone were, as near as I can recall, about $25 Billion. One doesn&amp;#8217;t have to stray too far to see that the United States government has become a massive insurer against property damage and casualty claims. The implications are simply enormous. More coming.
