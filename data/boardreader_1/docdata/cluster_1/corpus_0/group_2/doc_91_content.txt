The Oracle of Omaha is back at it again  this time with his sights on the financial sector.   Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has announced that it will invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs (perpetual preferred stock that comes with a 10 percent dividend). Berkshire will also receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give the conglomerate a 9% stake in Goldman   Goldman Sachs is an exception institution, Buffett said in a statement. It has an unrivaled global franchise, a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance.   Im not all that surprised Buffett has pounced on a somewhat distressed financial company. Goldman Sachs shares are down more than 50% from their record set last October 31 and Buffetts game plan has always been to invest in undervalued companies with strong management (its how he built Berkshire into a $199 billion company!).   Berkshires other stakes in financial companies, as of June 30, include:    American Express Co.    Bank of America Corp.   M&amp;amp;T Bank Corp.   SunTrust Banks Inc.    U.S. Bancorp    Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co.     Goldman Sachs shares are up more than 7% in after-hours trading, currently sitting at $134.75 a piece.
