Not my usual fodder for discussion, but it caught my eye today. Insurance giant American International Group (&amp;#8221;AIG&amp;#8221;) lost more than 50% of its stock value after Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway backed away from investment talks over the weekend. Thanks to the New York State insurance regulators, AIG was able to raise $20 billion from its subsidiaries to forestall a drastic downgrade of its debt by the credit rating agencies. CNBC is reporting that AIG&amp;#8217;s failure could become reality as early as tomorrow morning, while AIG believes it has until Wednesday to patch the Titanic-sized leak. The federal government is stepping in and seeking the assistance of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan in arranging financing that will keep AIG afloat until it can divest itself of assets and raise capital. Berkshire Hathaway has been involved in insurance companies with which I have worked. Obviously, Buffett saw something attractive in those investments that just aren&amp;#8217;t present in the AIG package. Where is this all going? With Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy and Bank of America gobbling up Merrill Lynch at a fire sale, our economic outlook is looking dimmer and dimmer. Hard to keep my eyes on legal research, writing and technology with that mushroom cloud smoldering over the horizon.
