                      Quote:              Prudential to pay $600M US penalty over market-timing claims     28/08/2006 3:05:36 PM                   news.sympatico.msn.ca/Business/ContentPosting                      Quote:              Prudential Financial Inc. and a subsidiary have agreed to pay $600 million US in penalties to resolve government allegations of deceptive late-market timing in the trading of mutual fund shares, the U.S. Justice Department announced Monday.            CBC News     The subsidiary, the New York-based Prudential Equity Group, LLC, has admitted to criminal wrongdoing in the scheme, which dates back to 1999, the department said.        The parent company, Prudential Financial Inc. of Newark, N.J., entered into a separate compliance agreement with the Justice Department. It agreed to co-operate in the continuing investigation of market timing and to maintain policies and procedures that insure that affiliated entities follow the law.                                     Quote:              Before Prudential's settlement, 15 firms had reached settlements totaling more than $3.5 billion - including a $675 million deal agreed to by the Bank of America Corp. in 2004.        2003 suit questions $1.3B in trades        The Prudential settlement stems from civil charges filed about three years ago.        The lawsuit alleged that five former Prudential Securities brokers and their branch manager in Boston helped sophisticated investors make more than $1.3 billion of market-timing trades in mutual-fund shares.        The suit alleged that the rapid trading raised expenses and lowered returns to shareholders of more than 50 fund families.        Authorities have alleged that Prudential's Boston-based brokers created fake accounts and changed account numbers to help mask the rapid trading by lucrative hedge-fund clients after certain mutual funds had blocked them or their customers from such trades.                        Funny thing, none of the 'lucrative hedge-fund clients' are identified......                     Quote:              A civil complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges the participants received nearly $5 million US in gross commissions in 2002 alone.                        in commissions alone.....  I wonder how much the hedgies made in PROFIT?        ed=link/fix
