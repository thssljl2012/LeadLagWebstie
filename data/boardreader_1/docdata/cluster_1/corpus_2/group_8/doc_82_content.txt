  Are all life insurance policies and pensions totally secure? What actions should you take to protect yourself. Seems like a smart thing to consider.   "Totally" secure would be a stretch, but you do have protection on life insurance and annuities. If you went to the Standard Life of Indiana website I linked earlier, you will see what State Insurance Departments do, when the assets of life insurance companies, threaten to drop below statutory levels. Most times, they can intercede, without any loss at all to the life/annuity contract holders.   Should this receivership fail, and the company go insolvent, then the State Insurance Guarantee Act in your respective state, will guarantee up to $300,000 in life benefits, and up to $100,000 in present value annuity benefits. The SIGA works in much the same fashion as the FDIC, charging premiums to all companies domiciled in their respective states, to deal with the aftermath of a life insurance company insolvency.    So yeah, you do have a couple of layers of protection for life and annuities. I can't comment on pensions.   Hope that helps a bit.
