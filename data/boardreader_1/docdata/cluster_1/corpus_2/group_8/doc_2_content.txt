  Just Enter.....      Dude, you need to do a little research about how life insurance companies function, as opposed to how property/casualty/credit insurance companies and financial institutions function. You can't seem to make the distinction, nor figure out, that a life insurance company's assets are not commingled with the assets of parent or affiliated companies. The bulk of AIG's holdings could tank, yet their life insurance entities could stand on their own. AIG, the holding company, can not touch the assets of AIG, the life insurance company. If they do want to sell the bonds that back those life/annuity contracts, then what they receive, becomes the new assets that back the contracts.   As far as regulators go, I believe State Insurance regulators have proven to be very much on top of things over the years, as opposed to the SEC. Of all the people I've seen on CNBC the last month, I would say the New York State Insurance Commisioner is probablythe mostknowledgable guy I have seen.   Have SEC regulators been asleep at the switch? Yes.    Are there a number of unscrupulous  ****  in the financial sector, screwing people out of their money? Unquestionably.   Just try to avoid painting with such a broad brush, that you totally misrepresent how life insurance companies function.   By the way, here is what AM Best has to say about AIG, as of yesterday. Not a totally favorable outlook, by any means, but notice, that Best has only moderate concern for AIG's life entities, and even though Best's overall outlook for AIG is "Negative", the implied decrease in their rating to  A-,  is still in the  Excellent  category.    I would contend, that Best knows how to separate the good from the bad, as far as AIG is concerned.    http://www3.ambest.com/frames/frameserver.asp?site=press&amp;tab=1&amp;altsrc=14&amp;altnum=&amp;refnum=65494651775646556655
