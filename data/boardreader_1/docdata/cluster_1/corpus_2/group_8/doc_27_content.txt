         LanRes wrote &lt;&lt;Most of the heavy losses at AIG are coming in two related areas. One area is that the market values of many of the investment securities held by AIG's general account (e.g., RMBS, CMBS) are impaired and AIG has been recognizing that  similar to what other financial institutions have been grappling with as well.&gt;&gt; I had suggested that the main cause of AIG's problem was their division writing CDS    http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=27489206   It seems that is not correct as I verified by checking with the 4Q08 supplemental using the link supplied by LanRes. On their consolidated state of income immediately after the table of contents, they had a line indicating for 4Q a $25B capital loss, and another another line for $6.8B their credit default swap portfolio. So the major part of the was not in the CDS, as I had suggested. AIG is an insurance business and they are supposed to invest the premiums in safe securities until something bad (e.g. hurricane, flood, etc) happens. Evidently the 25B loss was in mortgage papers (RMBS, CMBS) which were risky.  Still, IMHO, they should not have done any CDS at all.  Bernake in    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aHx9...   criticised AIG, saying "this was a hedge fund basically that was attached to a large and stable insurance company. I assume he meant the group investing the money was like a hedge fund.  decades wrote &lt;&lt;has there ever been a bigger debacle than AIG? I mean other than Citigroup of course.&gt;&gt; I think that FNM and FRE together may eventually cost the the government as much as AIG.
