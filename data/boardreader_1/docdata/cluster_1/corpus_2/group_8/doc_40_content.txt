 Hi Ruth, We are in a similar situation. We have AIG. However, our 457 money is safe for a three reasons, first its our employer that owns the assets, not AIG. Second, AIG is the third party administrator with our money in various mutual funds such as VG, American funds, Dryefus and third, the insurance section of AIG is not the part that is in trouble and like Hartford, it looks like it would be bought up by another company.   In your situation, in order to answer your question as accurately as possible, is your money in a Hartfords own proprietary fund or is it similar to our 457 in which the money is in various mutual funds?   Ask your employer. You have a right to know.   Steve
