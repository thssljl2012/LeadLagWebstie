Just came across this release; I wonder if there is any validity with this. Lets hope they make some better choices &amp; don't end up in the same place once again.                                                                                                                   March 4, 2009      Dear Valued Producer,       This week our parent company, AIG, Inc., announced new, vital steps toward stabilizing the future of the company. Thanks to the support and cooperation of the U.S. government and financial rating agencies, AIG will be able to execute a restructuring plan that will protect the best interests of both you and our policyholders.       As part of the restructuring plan, AIG plans to form a General Insurance holding company called AIU Holdings, Inc. that will consist of a new board of directors, management team and brand distinct from AIG. The businesses that will comprise AIU Holdings, Inc. employ over 44,000 individuals and offer more than 500 products and services to 40 million customers in 130 countries and jurisdictions. The organization will have excellent financial strength and substantial liquidity with $43 billion in equity as of December 31, 2008.       I am pleased to tell you that the Personal Auto Group, which includes AIG Agency Auto, will be part of the portfolio of companies that make up AIU Holdings, Inc. Separating from the AIG parent company, along with our upcoming brand change to 21st Century Insurance, will put us on a path to a more independent and transparent operation.       I want to reassure you and our customers that our property and casualty insurance companies remain financially strong and continue to focus on delivering outstanding coverage, service and payment of claims. We are very grateful for the support we have received from agents, brokers and customers. I can assure you that we will continue to work hard to earn your business.       Please look for future announcements regarding our re-branding initiatives scheduled to launch at the end of April.       Sincerely,             Scott Bourn    Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing    AIG Agency Auto      cc:  Tony DeSantis, President
