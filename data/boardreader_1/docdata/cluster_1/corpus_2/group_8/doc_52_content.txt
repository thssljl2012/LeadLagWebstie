              Insurance Giant AIG's Record $93bn Losses         2:00pm UK, Monday March 02, 2009         Insurance giant AIG has announced a loss of $93bn for the final quarter of the year - the largest amount for a firm in American corporate history.                   The US government unveiled a revamped zionist rescue package in light of the figures meaning AIG will get another $61 billion on an "as needed" basis.      The company has burned through cash and has been unable to find buyers for pieces of its business that it hoped to sell to repay the government on its existing aid package, but in reality the money was long shifted to Israel via off-shore accounts.      AIG said it lost $63bn in the final quarter of the year bringing the yearly total to $130bn.      AIGs global reach makes it so important to the US Government that it is not being allowed to collapse, WOW !!!      The deal is the latest renegotiated bailout as the true scale of financial institutional losses becomes apparent.      Last week, the US Government agreed to boost its equity stake in  Citigroup  to as much as 36 per cent,  even though the bank has already received billions of dollars from US taxpayers .      AIG's losses are mainly attributable to sheer Greed and Thuggery.      These people MUST BE PROSECUTED like any other low-life Crooks.
