        QUOTE     Insurance giant AIG has reported a loss of &#036;61.7bn (43bn) in the final three months of 2008 - the largest quarterly loss in US corporate history.    And the firm will receive an extra &#036;30bn from the US government as part of a revamped rescue package.   The new measures will also effectively cut the interest payments the insurer must pay to the Federal Reserve.   AIG has already received &#036;150bn in financial support - the biggest bail-out by far of any US company.      http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7918643.stm   That's just crazy, crazy money to lose. &#036;61bn in 3 months?! It's like they were doing a Brewster's Millions and trying to do it on purpose.
