          Quote:                         Insurance giant AIG has reported a loss of $61.7bn (43bn) in the final three months of 2008 - the largest quarterly loss in US corporate history.    And the firm will receive an extra $30bn from the US government as part of a revamped rescue package.    The new measures will also effectively cut the interest payments the insurer must pay to the Federal Reserve.    AIG has already received $150bn in financial support - the biggest bail-out by far of any US company.                      BBC .    Really and truly boggles the mind. How to you wave goodbye to  $61bn  in   3 months  ???    Although I realise they're in different industries, these guys make  RBS  look  good
