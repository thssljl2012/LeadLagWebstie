 Time for AIG to be dismantled in to smaller operation. They are trading at .42 cents             U.S. to provide another $30 billion to AIG          Company's fourth-quarter loss tops $61 billion           NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The U.S. government said Monday that it is revamping its bailout of insurance giant American International Group, committing up to another $30 billion of taxpayer money and increasing its stake in the company to keep the firm from failing on its financial contracts.      The move, the third government attempt to rescue the firm, follows closely on the heels of the government's third attempt to rescue banking giant Citigroup (  C  :  Citigroup Inc      Last:  1.50 -0.96-39.02%            C    1.50 ,   -0.96  ,   -39.0%  ) last week and demonstrates the growing severity of the financial crisis brought on by bad lending and borrowing decisions over the past several years.   Had the government not taken such action, AIG (  AIG  :  American International Group Inc      Last:  0.42 -0.10-19.23%      AIG    0.42 ,   -0.10  ,   -19.2%  ) would have had its credit ratings cut by major agencies, and that would have triggered the need for the firm to post collateral it did not have.   "In the short term, the plan would appear to address in particular the risk of a credit rating downgrade... If downgraded again, AIG would have to post further significant collateral," Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a Monday research report.   The firm guarantees about $300 billion of asset-backed securities and other debts.   "Given the systemic risk AIG continues to pose and the fragility of markets today, the potential cost to the economy and the taxpayer of government inaction would be extremely high," the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department said in a joint statement Monday.   The last time a firm in a similar situation failed was when Lehman Brothers collapsed in September, and the fallout from that was disastrous.   AIG shares rose 26% in pre-open trade, to 53 cents.   'Closely resembling common equity'  Under terms of the new deal, AIG will be able to draw down up to $30 billion from the government in exchange for new preferred shares.   "This facility will further strengthen AIG's capital levels and improve its leverage," the Treasury and the Fed said.   At the same time, the government's current $40 billion in AIG preferred shares will be converted into "new preferred shares with revised terms that more closely resemble common equity," according to the government.   The deal will put the government's stake in AIG at about 77% if it is fully executed.   The moves come as AIG reported a fourth-quarter loss of more than $61 billion, underscoring the precarious state of the New York-based company.   AIG, in which Washington acquired majority ownership last year, "continues to face significant challenges, driven by the rapid deterioration in certain financial markets in the last two months of the year and continued turbulence in the markets generally," the government said.   See the full press release  .   The new terms will provide for non-cumulative dividends and limit AIG's ability to redeem the preferred stock except with the proceeds from the issuance of equity capital.   For its part, the Fed will take actions tied to the $60 billion revolving-credit facility for AIG established by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last September, including repayment by preferred-stock interests involving a pair of the company's subsidiaries.   AIG will retain control of the subsidiaries -- American Life Insurance Co., known as Alico, and American International Assurance Co., or AIA -- though the New York Fed will have certain governance rights to protect its interests.   In addition, the New York Fed will seek to securitize life-insurance cash flows for up to about $8.5 billion in connection with special-purpose vehicles established by AIG's domestic life-insurance businesses.   See the Treasury and Fed's term sheet for AIG  .   $61 billion loss   On the bottom line, AIG's fourth-quarter loss widened to $61.66 billion, or $22.95 a share, significantly worse than the $5.29 billion loss in the year-earlier period.   Continued severe credit-market deterioration, particularly in commercial mortgage-backed securities, and charges related to ongoing restructuring-related activities weighed down the latest results.   Stripping out capital losses and other accounting items, AIG said it would have lost $37.9 billion, or $14.17 a share, for the 2008 fourth quarter. Insurance premiums and other considerations declined by 1.9% for the quarter, the company said.   For the full year 2008, AIG's reported loss was $99.3 billion, or $37.84 a share.             http://www.marketwatch.com/news/stor...09C6B5E92EC%7D
