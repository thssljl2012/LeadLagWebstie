                   St George Bank Dragons winger Wendell Sailor will this week return to the NRL side to take on the Knights at EnergyAustralia Stadium on Saturday night.   Sailor, 33, fractured his cheekbone in his much publicised comeback against the Broncos in Round 13 and will take the place of Michael Lett who has been named on an extended bench.   The only other changes to the side are the return of NSW centre Matt Cooper which forces Josh Morris to the wing and Chase Stanley into the back row whilst Lagi Setu will start at Lock with Stuart Webb also named on the extended bench.  Unavailable Dragons are: Mark Gasnier (back) indefinite, Ben Creagh (knee) Rnd 18   1. Brett MORRIS    2. Jason NIGHTINGALE    3. Josh MORRIS    4. Matt COOPER    5. Wendell Sailor    6.

I hope Reynoldson plays and gives his former team heaps..     Brownie has to let him play, surely..     He&amp;#039;ll gee up the boys heaps...     Stanley at 12... hmmmm
