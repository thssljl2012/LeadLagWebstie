GLBA is the root of the credit crisis problem and it was sponsored by REPUBLICANS. And before you jump on the Federal regulation bandwagon, let me point out that State based regulation of insurance companies IS working - the insurance subsidiaries of AIG are financially sound. The parent company of AIG, a creature of GLBA, is not regulated by the Feds and that is what led to this whole mess we are in. The NY Insurance Commissioner opined that CDS ought to be regulated by the Insurance Department and now the Feds are scrambling to head off what they think is a state intrusion into their oversight. However, like I said, the LACK of FEDERAL oversight IS the reason why we are now looking at a multi-billion dollar bailout.     You do know that bin Biden voted for deregulation and Clinton, Monica&amp;#039;s boyfriend, signed it into law, right?
