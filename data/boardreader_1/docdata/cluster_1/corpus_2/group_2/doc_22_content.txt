 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              =DJ AIG Ex-CEO Greenberg: Co May Have To File For Bankruptcy&amp;gt; AIG      &amp;amp;nbsp; By Lavonne Kuykendall&amp;amp;nbsp; Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES&amp;amp;nbsp; CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--If American International Group Inc. (AIG) doesn&amp;#039;t catch a break from ratings agencies and quickly find lenders who are willing to front it some money while it sells off assets, the insurance giant could be forced to file for bankruptcy, the former chief executive of the company said.    &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;There is no time,&amp;quot; said Hank Greenberg, former chairman and CEO of AIG and the person most responsible for building the insurer into a global giant, during an interview with CNBC on Tuesday morning. &amp;quot;If they don&amp;#039;t get a bridge loan, either from the private sector or the Fed&amp;quot; or some other willing investor, &amp;quot;and if ratings agencies don&amp;#039;t give it breathing space,&amp;quot; the company could be pushed into bankruptcy, even though it possesses the assets to see it through.    &amp;amp;nbsp;Greenberg, considered the ultimate insurance industry expert and the architect of AIG&amp;#039;s complex combination of insurance, financial services and capital markets businesses, stressed that in his opinion, the company is solvent, with around $1 trillion in assets and $70 billion in surplus capital.    &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;There is no company like it in the world,&amp;quot; and it should not be allowed to fail, Greenberg argued. He said consequences would be felt worldwide if AIG was pushed into bankruptcy, as well as by the company&amp;#039;s 100,000 employees and its investor base.    &amp;amp;nbsp;As Greenberg spoke, shares of AIG continued to tumble, falling 32% recently, to $3.26, part of a continuing downward trend that started with the company&amp;#039;s shares trading around $70 last October. Since then, the stock has moved steadily downward as losses mounted in its portfolio of derivatives contracts on subprime mortgage-backed securities.    &amp;amp;nbsp;He said counterparties to AIG&amp;#039;s many financial instruments would have to unwind deals and &amp;quot;get in line with everybody else&amp;quot; to get their share of what is owed them, which will take years. &amp;quot;It is so much more simple to solve this problem. To let it go down doesn&amp;#039;t make any sense.&amp;quot;    &amp;amp;nbsp;Greenberg spoke as reports mounted that AIG is having difficulty raising as much as $70 billion that it needs for payments it must make in light of its Monday credit rating downgrades by ratings agencies Standard and Poor&amp;#039;s and Moody&amp;#039;s Investors Service. AIG reportedly has failed in putting together a deal with JPMorgan Chase&amp;amp;nbsp; Co. (JPM) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for a bridge loan and now is dealing with the Federal Reserve.    &amp;amp;nbsp;The company has several healthy businesses it could sell to repay the money, but it needs around 90 days of breathing space to get the job done, Greenberg said.    &amp;amp;nbsp;He complained that Robert Willumstad, the company&amp;#039;s current chairman and chief executive, had brushed off his repeated offers to help.    &amp;amp;nbsp;In addition to being AIG&amp;#039;s former chief, Greenberg is also AIG&amp;#039;s largest individual shareholder. At times, he has been a vocal critic of how AIG has handled the growing crisis, which has pushed its share price down to $3.23 in recent trading from around $70 last October.    &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;He says he wants help, but nothing ever happens, it dies right there,&amp;quot; Greenberg said of his relationship to Willumstad.    &amp;amp;nbsp;Greenberg pushed hard for the Federal Reserve to get involved in loaning AIG the money if it fails to raise capital in the private market, arguing that it would not really be a bailout.    &amp;amp;nbsp;AIG has the money to repay the loan, he argued. &amp;quot;The company can survive and prosper.&amp;quot; -By Lavonne Kuykendall, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4141;  lavonne.kuykendall@dowjones.com     &amp;amp;nbsp;Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today&amp;#039;s most important business and market news, analysis and commentary:  http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=Ft66e%2BXvbMLa7fjXiGgXbQ%3D%3D .
