    L k:      Indy11:      L k:  Not a conservatorship... so it&amp;#039;s basically a buyout?   It is a kind of a buyout. It is a 24 month loan and the debt is to be repaid by the proceeds of the sall off of AIG&amp;#039;s assets (its various subsidiary insurance companies which, apart from that operation in the UK that seems to have been in the dark about bonding all those mortgage backed securities, are all very sound.  This way, AIG doesn&amp;#039;t have to sell off is prize possessions at fire sale prices but, instead, can in an orderly fashion sell off its businesses to the highest bidder in a more fair market environment.  The Fed is not known to lose money so my guess is that Bernanke&amp;#039;s number crunchers think that the repayment of debt will fully satisfy the chargeable interest.  In a more purely private example, those buyout firms used to do this too. Take over an ailing corporation, trim down the operations into extra lean concerns to improve the bottom line and then sell off the pieces and pocket the presumed profit made in the deal. The Fed isn&amp;#039;t taking profit on the sale but is making money on the interest off of the $85Bn &amp;quot;loan.&amp;quot;  Thanks Indy. What would happen if they defaulted on their loan for some reason?    I assume that the taxpayers will then exercise their  80% stake, take over and the selloff would continue under government direction.
