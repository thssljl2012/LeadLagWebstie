It can be good, but it seems like it really wasn&amp;#039;t explained well enough to you.    I&amp;#039;ve got to disagree with agent jeff on the term though.  With that Quality of Life, you can accelerate the benefits on several conditions -- which is something you can&amp;#039;t do with many policies, let alone term.  Of course, your health insurance is there to take care of you with one of those major illnesses, but I like the idea of being able to get money from the face amount (not a partial surrender for you agents out there) to help bridge gaps or cover costs.    Furthermore, the guaranteed rates really aren&amp;#039;t that great.  However, those policies pay higher current rates.  Sure, current rates aren&amp;#039;t guaranteed (hence the name, current), but current rates are tied to many things like bonds and what not.  Interest rates are pretty low right now, and they really aren&amp;#039;t going to go much lower.  (look at historical government bond yields to see what I&amp;#039;m talking about)      By the way, for a 500K Flex Pro Plus, I&amp;#039;m showing 340/ mo  ($4080 annual premium) that builds excellent cash surrender values @ the current rates.                      I am attempting to contract to sell the Quality of Life product, however AIG brokerage knows nothing of this product.  How do you become contracted, or are you direct with AIG?
