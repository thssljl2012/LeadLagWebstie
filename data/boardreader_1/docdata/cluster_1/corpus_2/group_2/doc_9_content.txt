    Indy11:       The Texas Jester:         The Texas Jester:            Indy11:  If it works according to plan, the AIG loan will make some pretty big money for the Fed.                  &amp;quot;IF&amp;quot; being the key word.        Fannie and Freddie &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; needed 20 billion, so the govt bought it for over $200 billion..... AIG &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; needed $25 billion to secure itself, so govt gave them $85 billion....... yeah, I beleive everything uncle sam tells me...hahahahahahaha      In all reality, we just &amp;quot;loaned&amp;quot; a bankrupt company 85 billion bucks, with the &amp;quot;HOPE&amp;quot; that they can sell some of their worthless weight (yeah, sign me up.. I want some of that worthless stock)....      AIG, like fannie, freddie &amp;amp; lehman, may be non-govermental entities, however, they invested in, and allowed foreign investors to invest in, a bunch of bad decisions..... here lies the big picture.... some of those foreign investors incluse China, Kuwait, Saudi..... now, do u think uncle sam wants those countries pissed off? why hell no.... hence all the recent bailouts......    you know the old saying... &amp;quot;When you dance with the devil......&amp;quot;        oh... forgot to mention.... see the stock market this morning???? LMAO...yeah, that &amp;quot;bailout&amp;quot; caused a 260 point drop after the opening bell on wall street...... yeah... the bailout is reeeeaaaallly going to save us.......   From what the Fed did for AIG as far as the insurance market place is concerned, I would say that it did a good thing. It makes provision for those people who are insured by AIG to expect that their insurance policies or bonds still are worth the paper they were printed on. It provides assurance that the bonds issued to insure against default on those mortgage backed securities actually represent payable dollars if the claims are established properly.  Loaning out the money to AIG, however, does not at all mean that AIG will exist two years from now. So it is not a &amp;quot;bail out&amp;quot; in that sense. All it really is doing is what outfits like KKR have done in the private sector. It makes it possible to sell off AIG&amp;#039;s assets at the highest possible price in that time frame and makes it possible for the Fed to make a profit on the deal.  So it isn&amp;#039;t really a bail out. AIG as we know it today will not exist two years from now.    PRECISELY my friend.... however....... In order to attempt to cover their asses, the fed&amp;#039;s are supplementing this by creating some new treasury notes..... which in theory is an outstanding idea.... the reality though is who will buy them?????? At this point (seeing the Dow at a 283 point drop in the less than 2 hours).. i dont see anyone buying them..... damn Im glad my money is in gold and silver (gold up 5% again today )
