    it was reported that Today&amp;#039;s Stock Meltdown = $900 Billions Lost..  I&amp;#039;m not worried, I&amp;#039;ve got all my money with Lehman Brothers securities. They&amp;#039;ve been around for 158 years. My Mortgage and life insurance is backed by AIG. Life is good.    Funny but not funny...  My mom worked for Lehman Bros for fifteen years and is seriously worried about her pension now that she&amp;#039;s retired.  My 401K has equaled out in the past three years. I am about back to when I started saving three years ago    Last I checked the world was going to end on December 20th 2012. I&amp;#039;m not worried about savings at all............
