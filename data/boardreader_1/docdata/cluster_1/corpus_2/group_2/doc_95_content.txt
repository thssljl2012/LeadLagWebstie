Even if our government didn&amp;amp;#039;t step in and bail them out, a foreign country/business/bank would have.&amp;amp;nbsp; There was too much foreign pressure here for us to not do something about it.  &amp;amp;quot;AIG was a major seller of &amp;amp;quot;credit-default swaps,&amp;amp;quot; essentially insurance against default on assets tied to corporate debt and mortgage securities. Weakness at AIG could force financial institutions in the U.S., Europe and Asia that bought these swaps to take write-downs or losses.&amp;amp;quot;  As far as why AIG is in trouble, their insurance business is great, but their &amp;amp;quot;financial products&amp;amp;quot; are fucking them real good.  &amp;amp;quot;AIG&amp;amp;#039;s cash squeeze is driven in large part by losses in a unit separate from its traditional insurance businesses. That financial-products unit, which has been a part of AIG for years, sold the credit-default swap contracts designed to protect investors against default in an array of assets, including subprime mortgages.&amp;amp;quot;  Housing market took a shit, and AIG was left holding the bag.
