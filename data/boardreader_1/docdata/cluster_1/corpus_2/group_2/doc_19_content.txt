Actually it is E&amp;amp;O, errors and omissions and this is not the insurance that is causing the problems. AIG insures investments to guarantee paper at a certain dollar amount, when a large investment (housing) is forced to downgrade it value the insurance props the value up because it is guaranteed by the insurer AIG. these write downs start cascading because all these banks consider paper they are holding as capital on their books, when it devalues the scramble for hard cash begins.
