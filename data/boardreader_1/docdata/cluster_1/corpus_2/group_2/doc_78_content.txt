You don&amp;#039;t seem to grasp how just how far the investments of these companies reach. See below.     Mountainhawk wrote: The problem here is merely one of perception.  Now, perception can become reality in economics fairly quickly if it isn&amp;#039;t checked, so having the morons on CNN and Fox News droning on about this being as bad as the GD could become a self fulfilling prophesy if the American people believe it.   One of the biggest investment banks in the world just declared bankruptcy. Another, Bear Stearns, is dead. Washington Mutual, the country&amp;#039;s biggest savings-and-loan, had its rating lowered to junk status by S&amp;amp;amp;P this morning. AIG dropped 61% yesterday and a further 42% today -- and that one has  a trillion dollars  in assets worldwide. That&amp;#039;s a fucking goddamn lot of zeroes that I&amp;#039;m merely perceiving. How, exactly, is none of this reality to you?     Nothing of value has been destroyed.  These are all paper losses, and ultimately, whether under their current owners or new ones, the assets will be valued by the market at their real value, not at these panic-deflated prices.    Let&amp;#039;s take AIG.  They have massive amounts of assets ... $1,050B according to wiki as of June 2008.   They have liabilities apparently in the $972B range, because wiki puts their equity at $78B.  If AIG goes down completely, then those assets will have to be liquified, certainly for less than book value.  If they liquify them for, say, $800B, then there is going to be a $172B effect, as the liabilities can&amp;#039;t totally be paid off.  However, all the assets still exist, they just are revalued and have changed ownership.  In fact, they are likely undervalued at $800B, because forced liquidation of illiquid assets will often mean that you get less than the true economic value of the assets.  Stock prices are merely a reflection of the expected future profitability of a company.  Stocks are necessarily a zero sum game.  AIG printed stock for $0, and brought in capital initally equal to the initial selling of the share minus the commission, and then every future buyer/seller of the stock cancels out, until the final buyer of the stock sees the stock price drop to $0, which in the end completes the zero-sum.  Total amount paid for AIG stock = Total amount received for AIG stock + adjustment for commissions.   Stock prices are not a reflection of real current value.  They are nothing more than an estimate of how well the particular management of a corporation will use the assets at it&amp;#039;s disposal to produce profit.  If the market loses faith in the AIG management (which is has dramatically) or the corporations ability to produce profits with its&amp;#039; strategy, assets, and liabilities, it is a GOOD thing for capital to leave that corporation and be used elsewhere instead.  AIG situation is more complicated because they have insurance operations, and therefore will not be liquidated as fast and the policyholders will be protected above all other creditors, but as far as I know the insurance parts of the operation are still well capitalized, so they could be spun off to keep that part of AIG alive and well, as the unprofitable parts go down.  We&amp;#039;ll have to see how the NYDoI deals with it.
