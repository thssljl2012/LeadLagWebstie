Isn&amp;#039;t moving that money illegal, and wouldn&amp;#039;t they be up for criminal charges?       AIG does have a significant life insurance group, ALICO.   And yes moving the money would violate state insurance regulations -- that is what the whole $20 billion NY Governor announcement was about.  It was an announcement that they would allow AIG to transfer the assets, in effect lifting the regulation on asset transfers for AIG.  That&amp;#039;s why the NY government were emphasizing &amp;amp;quot;no taxpayer money is being used&amp;amp;quot;.                      Quote:                  Hurricane Andrew was enough to kill off a large Australian re-insurer, that found itself &amp;#039;holding the parcel&amp;#039;. Who is going to be up for Ike?  It sounds very similar to Andrew. Not a CAT5, but causing widespread damage with a large economic impact.       Andrew was a long time ago and the reinsurance industry has significantly changed their outlook on risk acceptance since then, and then did further changes after 9/11.  Nowadays it is rare for a reinsurer to hold a significant amount of risk in any one geographic location (geographic concentration risk), most reinsurers do detailed stress scenario testing on their portfolio of reinsurance policies to detect any unacceptable levels of risk concentration.  In many jurisdictions regulators require them to do such testing.      There are hundreds of reinsurance companies in the world now so generally catastrophe risks such as hurricanes can be spread out among so many companies that the impact can be absorbed.  KRW (2005 Hurricanes Katrina, Rita &amp;amp;amp; Wilma) was a real test of how well reinsurance companies have now diversified their risks.  There were no large-scale reinsurance company bankruptcies after KRW despite it being a much more severe event than Andrew (Katrina alone has estimates as high as $60b insurable loss).  A few reinsurers did go into run-off, which is different than a bankruptcy in that claims are still paid, so I do not recall any disruptions in payments of claims to mom-and-pop policyholders due to reinsurance issues.
