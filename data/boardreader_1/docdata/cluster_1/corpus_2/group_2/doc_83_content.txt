AIA said that his decision to leave the company is in no way related to the recent developments at AIG. It was a personal decision that he had been planning for some time.       Mr Kenneth Juneau, executive vice president &amp;amp;amp; senior regional life executive of AIA&amp;#039;s regional office, will assume leadership responsibilities with effect from September 19, 2008 in the interim until a statement is made on the new general manager for AIA Singapore.      Mr Juneau, an AIA veteran, has more than 30 years experience in the insurance industry.      AIG announced on 16 September 2008 that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is providing a two-year, US$85 billion secured revolving credit facility to AIG that will ensure that the company can meet its liquidity needs. - CNA/vm                        hard to believe.
