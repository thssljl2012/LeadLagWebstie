My BIL is in the reinsurance industry and according to him consumers were never threatened concerning insurance failure and the AIG&amp;#039;s consumer insurance units are completely well-capitalized because the law requires it.      We bailed them out because of their financial products division and basically are saving them from their inability to manage risks in investments.      Who else are we going to bailout?                      Good question and I wonder myself.  This is a Catch 22.   The situation is a no win because of the problems that have piled up and how they have to get dealt with.  They had to take immediate action but bailing out a private company like this sets a bad example.
