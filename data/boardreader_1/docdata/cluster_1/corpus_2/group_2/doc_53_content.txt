Don&amp;#039;t be too sure. AIG is an underwriter insurer. I wouldn&amp;#039;t doubt it has its hands in your insurance company as well as many others. This is one of the major concerns and why the Fed did what it did in the seize/control of the company.     Without getting too detailed...I&amp;#039;m kinda &amp;#039;in the business&amp;#039; and the phones have been ringing and ringing all day.    I&amp;#039;m not sure what you mean by &amp;#039;underwriter insurer&amp;#039; but there is an &amp;#039;underwriting process&amp;#039; that every insurance company has.    AIG is a player in the reinsurance market, but in general they write, though independent insurance agents, insurance products and others financial products and have little to do with other insurance companies unless they are companies that are actually part of AIG - like Lexington Insurance Company.    AIG is in trouble and people, companies, corporations, etc., are moving their insurance coverages now.&amp;amp;nbsp; Not all of them, but if the agencies that rate insurance companies downgrade AIG any further what you will see is a mandated move to get business out of AIG.&amp;amp;nbsp; In fact, many business are required to not place any of their financial business with companies that do not have a sound financial rating.    AIG is in deep trouble, and even with the Fed&amp;#039;s help today it may still come down to a fire sell of AIG&amp;#039;s assets...most of which will be selling the individual business units of the company...basically jus breaking up the company into many different parts.   Reinsurance is what I meant, thank you for the correction as well as the information.
