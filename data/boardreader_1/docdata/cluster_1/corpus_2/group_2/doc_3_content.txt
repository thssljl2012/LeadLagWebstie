           Over 2,000 policies terminated in Hong Kong amid AIG fears     Agence France-Presse First Posted 15:15:00 09/18/2008   HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong subsidiary of troubled insurance titan AIG said on Thursday that more than 2,000 policies had been terminated by customers who feared a collapse.  In a bid to lure back their customers, American International Assurance (AIA) said it would waive re-admission charges and a health declaration requirement for those who decided to revive their life insurance policies with them.  &amp;quot;We hope that our customers are convinced that our business remains sound and profitable,&amp;quot; Derek Yung, senior vice-president and general manager of AIA for Hong Kong and Macau, told a press conference Thursday.  &amp;quot;If the customers decide to come back to us in the coming two weeks, we will waive the requirement for them to provide proof of their health conditions,&amp;quot; he said, adding that the measure was &amp;quot;unprecedented in Hong Kong&amp;quot;.  The policies were terminated as panic spread after the US Federal Reserve handed its parent company American International Group (AIG) an unprecedented 85-billion-dollar rescue loan on Tuesday in an attempt to avoid a global economic shock.  Yung said the number of policy cancellations was small, considering that they had written a total of 2.2 million policies for their 1.3 million customers.  The subsidiary also denied reports that there were plans to sell their business and maintained they were financially separate from AIG.  &amp;quot;Even though AIA Hong Kong is a subsidiary of AIG, it keeps a separate and sound book of its own. AIA is well-capitalised and will continue to operate as normal to meet customer needs,&amp;quot; said Yung.  &amp;quot;From the information we have got at this stage, we will not be selling our business,&amp;quot; he added.
