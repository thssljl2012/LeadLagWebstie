Do you anything to back this up?      The foreign exposure is @ $20B USD. What is that in Euros?                           Here&amp;#039;s the way that goes.      Banks have to have reserves. Those reserves get rated based on the safety of the assets the banks have. The safer the assets, the greater the percentage of those assets the bank gets to count. For example they may say a $1,000 AAA bond counts as $1,000 while as $1,000 B rated bond may count only as $500 for assets as it is not as safe.      One way to make bonds safer is to insure them. A B bond backed by insurance will be rated as AAA, so it would count as $1,000, not $500.      AIG insured a lot of the CDO&amp;#039;s and other stuff backed by the mortgages for European banks. So the banks get to count those as AAA with a high percentage of the value counted towards their reserves..      If AIG fails, then the insurance goes bye bye and those AAA rated bonds now revert back to B (or whatever they were) bonds which means they count much less against the reserves required for the bank. which means the banks would now be under reserved. Which means that unless they can raise capital immediately, they fail.      Especially since AIG insured a lot of the stuff that is now considered toxic and close to worthless.
