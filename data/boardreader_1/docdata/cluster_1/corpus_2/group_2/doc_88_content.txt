           Actually, a company under the &amp;amp;quot;AIG umbrella&amp;amp;quot; - AIG Retirement.     AIG employs 100,000 people world-wide, and is one of the biggest, if not the biggest underwriters of commercial insurance in the world.     As we were &amp;amp;quot;schooled&amp;amp;quot; yesterday by our CEO-de-jour Edward M. Liddy, much of the bailout was a &amp;amp;quot;huge vote of confidence&amp;amp;quot; in AIG and it&amp;#039;s subsidiaries.     BS - in my opinion.     What truth was offered was the reality of how big a position AIG holds in the insurance industry, both in the US and worldwide.      Think of insurance as a supply and demand industry and you&amp;#039;ll see the implications. In &amp;amp;quot;general&amp;amp;quot; there is a fixed amount of insurable risk in the world. The more companies that are present in the market, the smaller share of that risk each must assume. The smaller the share, the lower their overall exposure to loss which translates into lower premiums. Understand that the cost of insurance is made up of several factors:  1) Risk of the insured - higher risk insureds = higher risk to insurance company.  2) Total exposure to that particular type of risk currently held by insurance company.  3) How that particular risk balances out against other risks held by the insurance company.     So - if AIG were allowed to go belly-up, that nullifies all insurance policies currently held by AIG. All of the insureds covered by those policies would have to go elsewhere to obtain their coverage. With now fewer players in the market absorbing all of the risk, rates would be higher - possibly much higher.     The government decided to loan (buy into) AIG to prevent a serious destabilizing event in the insurance industry.     As put to us in the conference call, the loan also allowed AIG to prevent declaring bankruptcy, a move which would have trashed the AIG Pension Fund. They powers that be offer that as a &amp;amp;quot;we&amp;#039;re interested in our current and former employee&amp;#039;s welfare&amp;amp;quot; - the cynic in me says &amp;amp;quot;it was cheaper to take the loan than to declare bankruptcy - had it been the other way around, AIG would be bankrupt today&amp;amp;quot;     AIG is a very diversified organization - insurance is just part of what they do. Each of the insurance divisions is fully funded and solvent, as they are monitored by a variety of boards and groups in the markets in which they write policies. They&amp;#039;re required to maintain a risk/cash equity balance percentage much the way banks are required to maintain a certain cash-on-hand balance vs loans.     Many of these separately managed and solvent companies, AIG Retirement included, are profitable, but do not have sufficient cash reserves to the tune that the parent company needed to remain solvent.     According to what we&amp;#039;ve been told, part of the driving force behind AIG&amp;#039;s recent catastrophic drop is the SEC requirement of Mark-to-Market for our investment holdings. Companies that manage risk all seek to maximize gain on premium flow by investing those $ in a variety of markets. One of the markets traditionally chosen by AIG has been mortgage bonds. Again, according to what we were told, (and they have no reason to lie as the information is public domain and can easily be confirmed) AIG only purchases highly rated mortgage bonds - none of the crashing bonds associated with the current mortgage lending crisis were held by AIG. Regardless, there is guilt by association, and the prime mortgage bonds also took a hit as the sub-prime bonds plummeted. Mark-to-market means that AIG must write down the value of all investments held as they drop in value. If we purchase a $100,000 mortgage bond on December 1, and on January 1 that same bond is now selling for $80,000, we must expense $20,000 as a loss on the bond we currently hold - REGARDLESS of our intent to hold or sell said bond. If, on February 1, that same bond is now selling at $125,000, we must declare an income of $45,000 as a gain on that bond - again - REGARDLESS of our intent to hold or sell said bond.     AIG buys mortgage bonds as long-term investments. Having to write down values short-term is contrary to the position we hold. We are actively petitioning the SEC for a change in the rules that require us to do short-term mark-to-market adjustments on long-term held investments. Given the recent major collapses of Enron and others, it&amp;#039;s not likely the SEC will cave.     However, having said that, the intent of mark-to-market is to give a fair, conservative appraisal of an organizations true asset value. This protects the investor, at the cost of possibly under-valuing a company.     As with most things in the financial arena, if companies would cling tightly to the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) rulings that suggest/govern how finances should be reported, things would work out better for all concerned. Silly little things like making mortgages with people that aren&amp;#039;t financially sound enough to merit a mortgage would never occur. In most situations, FASB rules suggest a conservative approach to finances. Under-report earnings, over-report liabilities. Loans aren&amp;#039;t income (ENRON!!!), they&amp;#039;re cash in the bank with an offsetting liability item. Run a company in such a manner to allow it to remain a going concern for future generations of employees and customers.     When I bought my house in 1991, I had to clear numerous hurdles to secure financing, and this with a 740+ credit rating back then. At closing, my lender required me to bring a check to pay off a department store charge account that had a $150.00 balance! They took the check and mailed it.   10+ years later, after a series of financial setbacks, (never having missed or been late on a mortgage payment) when I went to refinance with a 620 credit rating, it was &amp;amp;quot;no problemo&amp;amp;quot;. At the income level I had in 1991, a 620 credit score would have not been sufficient to qualify even for the measley $53k mortgage I took out.     AIG has invested in mortgage bonds for decades. It has been a safe, reliable way to recognize a respectable gain on our money. A few (possibly many) get-rich-quick schemers have turned a once safe way of making money with money into a seething pit of loss and dispair - and in the offing nearly pulled a multi-billion $ company down the tubes with them.     Whether we will weather this crisis remains to be seen.     What does all this mean for me and my AIG brethren? According to Mr. Liddy, they are actively assessing the value of the various parts and pieces that make up AIG. Some assets will be sold. They are also actively seeking to reorganize the parts of the business so devastated by the sub-prime mortgage industry to be less affected by problems like this.     Many of my co-workers here, having logged decades of service to AIG Retirement (we were formally called VALIC - Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company and were part of American General when it was purchased by AIG about 7 years ago) think come 2009 we will be part of a different company than AIG. We&amp;#039;re profitable and are a major player in the retirement management business in the K-12, University and Healthcare industries. We have value to someone out there.     Being cast off from the AIG boat won&amp;#039;t be a bad thing for AIG Retirement - if AIG goes down the tubes, at least we won&amp;#039;t go with it. Realistically, since we don&amp;#039;t have a product to sell, but rather a service, the quickest way to increase profits is to decrease expenses, and our biggest expense is Payroll. That translates into staff reduction.     Far as I&amp;#039;m concerned, working for AIG isn&amp;#039;t all that great a deal. They&amp;#039;re a New York-based organization that bought up a Texas-based organization. New York corporate politics and policies are very different than Texas-based policies, and far as I&amp;#039;m concerned, not for the better as an employee.     As a simple example - I work a 9/80 schedule. I work 9 hours a day (10 including lunch) for 9 days, and get to take the 10th day off. So every other Friday, I&amp;#039;m off work. Everywhere I&amp;#039;ve worked besides AIG they understand the concept that I&amp;#039;m &amp;amp;quot;banking&amp;amp;quot; the hours in advance of my day off. With Ike&amp;#039;s arrival, AIG closed the offices last Friday, Sept 12 - my 9/80. As of the end of business on Thursday, 9/11, I had banked 8+ hours to allow me to be off on Friday. When I asked about how my 9/80 day was to be handled since they were effectively giving the rest of the employees that day off with pay, the corporate line was &amp;amp;quot;thanks very much for working those extra hours, that&amp;#039;s just how it goes&amp;amp;quot; - WTF???? I don&amp;#039;t think so... In my book, and what I know about labor law, that constitutes unfair and biased treatment of an employee.      Similar treatment is received should my 9/80 fall on a company holiday. I am still expected to work 9 hours a day in advance of the holiday. Everywhere else I worked, your 9/80 could be taken the day after or before the holiday - you&amp;#039;d already banked the hours and they were yours to claim. Optionally, you could cut back your hours to 8-per-day and take the holiday - not so at AIG - I&amp;#039;m listed as a 9-hour-per-day employee and I&amp;#039;m expected to be here 9 hours minimum. Fortunately, I have a boss that feels like I do about the mistreatment, so we &amp;amp;quot;work it out&amp;amp;quot;. My previous boss wasn&amp;#039;t of a like mind, so I had to resort to other methods to retrieve my lost hours.     Anyway - that&amp;#039;s my take on this sorry situation.
