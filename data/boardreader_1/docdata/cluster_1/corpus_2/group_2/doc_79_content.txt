I think many policies holders like yourself would be facing the same thing. Cut also pain, don&amp;#039;t cut also pain. Whats your take on future bonus projections or more bonus cuts? This would greatly affect AIA endowment/savings plan policies holders due to the low guaranteed and high non guarateed returns of their savings plan.                      I think this is totally unprecedented. For 150 years, some insurance companies even longer, nothing like this has ever happened to suggest diversification of insurance companies should be the way to go. Mindsets may now change, I dunno.        Myself I prefer to buy term, invest the rest. Those future projections, forget abt it. Whatever is consolidated as to date, I&amp;#039;ll be happy if I can salvage them.
