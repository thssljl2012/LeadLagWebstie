           Advertisements [ ? ]                 Edited on Wed Sep-24-08 03:45 PM by coalition_unwilling          Folks, I believe I have a pretty good understanding of the financial meltdown that has been occurring recently.  I do have a question that some of you with experience in financial services industry may be able to answer:  What is the relationship between a mortgage, a car loan, or a credit card balance and a Credit Default Swap (if any)?  Here is a hypothetical example (purposely kept simple) of my question:  Let&amp;#039;s say I&amp;#039;m a banker at Bank of America and I decide to issue an ARM mortgage for $500,000 to a borrower whose credit is less than sterling. I am thinking that the borrower&amp;#039;s wages cannot pay the mortgage over its lifetime (and especially after a 3-year re-set to a higher rate). But I am betting that continued appreciation in the price of housing will allow said borrower to re-finance to a fixed rate mortgage.  However, I am not 100% sure of my thinking, so I wish to acquire a Credit Default Swap that will insure against the borrower defaulting on his mortgage.  Four questions:  1) Does the BofA mortgage banker go to the market to purchase a Credit Default Swap from a CDS provider like AIG?  2) If yes, what is BofA purchasing, insurance that BofA will be made whole in case the mortgage defaults?  3) If, in my hypothetical example, AIG sells BofA a Credit Default Swap, is\was AIG required to maintain any capital reserves against the possibility that the loan would default?  4) BofA sought insurance against a default, AIG (and its like) sought revenue by insuring against a default. Both parties probably assumed housing prices would continue to rise, hence very little risk. Was the risk all along that the rate of increase in housing prices (the &amp;quot;housing bubble&amp;quot;) could not keep indefinitely outpacing increase in median income\wages?  I&amp;#039;m just trying to make sure I have a good, general understanding of the rot.  Edited to add: I would be especially interested in the insights of HamdenRice or NadinBrezhinski (or their followers) on these questions.  Further edited for clarity of expression.                        ...
