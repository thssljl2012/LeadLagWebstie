And so I will be looking for a new car insurance company...pricks.  I never knew AIG bought 21st Century insurance (the company I originally got insurance from) until a few months ago when the AIG logo showed up on my bill instead of 21st Century (and AIG bought them out a year ago).  After this I am switching insurance companies, even if it costs me more.
