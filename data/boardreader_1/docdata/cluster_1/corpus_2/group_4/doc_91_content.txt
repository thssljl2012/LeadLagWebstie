   I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR REPUGLICANS TO CLICK ON A LINK AND  READ .....SO......       WASHINGTON (AFP)  The US government announced Monday, November 10th, an expanded bailout for insurance giant AIG of more than 150 billion dollars, as the Treasury tapped into emergency funds originally set for banks.    The latest bailout plan, the largest in US history, came as AIG burned through billions of dollars of cash and reported a third-quarter loss of 24.47 billion dollars.    The original Federal Reserve rescue of 85 billion dollars in mid-September, at the time the largest in corporate history, was expanded by 37.8 billion dollars just a few weeks later, and involved the government acquisition of a 79.9 percent stake in the troubled insurer.
