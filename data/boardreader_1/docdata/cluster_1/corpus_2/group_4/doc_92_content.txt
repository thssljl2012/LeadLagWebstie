Jim Puplava: Rapid Implosion of AIG Shows How Explosive Derivatives Are Ref - http://www.financialsense.com/fsn/BP/2008/1004.html Where this comes home to roost, you had a company like AIG, the largest insurance company  a trillion dollar balance sheet. If you were to think of a blue chip company that would be one of them. And the basic business of AIG  their insurance divisions  they were profitable, they were making money but they had one little division writing credit default swaps on these collateralized toxic securities and look what happened; they went from the largest insurance company to receivership in two days . . . thats where I think that saying that Warren Buffett said many years ago that derivatives were financial weapons of mass destruction because when you can take a trillion dollar insurance company with a trillion dollar balance sheet and blow it up in two days, it just goes to show you how explosive these things are.
