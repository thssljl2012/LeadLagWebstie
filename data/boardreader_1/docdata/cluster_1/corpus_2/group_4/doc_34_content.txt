          ambest.com  still rates AIG very well, but can we trust rating agencies anymore?  We&amp;#039;ve had an UL and ROP30 policies with AIG for the last 5 years. My concerns/questions are as follows?  - Is it a safe bet to stay with AIG or should we cut our losses and look for another insurance company? We have a term life insurance with a different co. though.  - In case AIG decides to sell their retail insurance, would the buyer abide our insurance policies with their original provisions?  So, I&amp;#039;m not sure whether we should get nervous about this co. or stay put.  Thanks
