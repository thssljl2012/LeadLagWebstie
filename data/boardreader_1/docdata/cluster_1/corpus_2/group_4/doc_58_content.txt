Ah yes, that one small exception--AIG--$150 billion to cover swaps sold to mostly foreign banks.  The question remains Why AIG?  We were told that AIG&amp;#039;s operating companies were well reserved and well capitalized and thus the public was not at risk of losing insurance coverage.  AIG&amp;#039;s financial products division operated out of London and did most of its business with European banks that, the Journal pointed out in a November 12 article, will emerge absolutely unscathed from their dealings with AIG.  The American taxpayer foots the bill.  The AIG fiasco absolutely destroys any common sense arguement against a bailout of Detroit.  How can our government in a blink of an eye, commit $150 billion to mainly foreign banks while denying $20 to $25 billion to good ol&amp;#039; GM.  At least that money would be frittered away mostly within the US.
