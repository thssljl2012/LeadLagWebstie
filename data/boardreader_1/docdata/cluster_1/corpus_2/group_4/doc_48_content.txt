Hah!...did you see this, MrBankRoll? AIG cancels Terry Bradshaw appearance Troubled insurance giant AIG recently got in hot water with the U.S. Congress for throwing a $440,000 luxury retreat after accepting an $85 billion bailout from Uncle Sam. But hey, AIG did cancel Terry Bradshaw. Shortly before hosting another $343,000 conference for 150 independent financial planners at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak resort in Phoenix from Nov. 5-7, the company told the Arizona Republic it canceled an appearance by Bradshaw at the event. AIG sacked the Fox NFL Sunday analyst even though his appearance fee was supposed to be picked up by a sponsor, spokesman Nick Ashooh told Game On! Wednesday morning. &amp;quot;Terry Bradshaw was supposed to speak. But AIG was never going to pay for him. He was supposed to be paid by somebody else. But just because of the publicity around it, we canceled it,&amp;quot; Ashooh says. AIG picked up only 10% of the cost of the conference, or around $23,000, he adds. The rest was paid for by sponsors and the independent planners themselves. Bradshaw doesn&amp;#039;t come cheap, pocketing $40,000 and up for appearances, according to the web site of his booking agent. Congressional lawmakers, then-presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain and the White House excoriated AIG for lavishly entertaining executives at the swanky St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort in California last month after accepting the tax-payer financed bailout. White spokesman Dana Perino called the company&amp;#039;s expenses (including $23,380 for spa treatments and $6,939 for golf) &amp;quot;despicable.&amp;quot; Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) said AIG execs are &amp;quot;getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that.&amp;quot; On Oct. 10, AIG chief executive officer Edward Liddy directed all employees to reduce expenses. More than 160 events were canceled. Yesterday, Liddy issued a statement saying news reports &amp;quot;grossly mischaracterized&amp;quot; AIG&amp;#039;s role in the Phoenix event. Minus Bradshaw, the company moved forward with the seminar because the financial planners who sell its products had generated almost $200 million in revenue for the company through Sept. 30th, he added. Says Ashooh: &amp;quot;They portrayed it as AIG using taxpayer dollars to pay Terry Bradshaw to speak. We were never going to be the ones paying for him.&amp;quot;
