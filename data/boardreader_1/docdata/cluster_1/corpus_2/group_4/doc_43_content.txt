 LOL !         Quote:                            First came the bailout. Now comes talk of a bailout from the bailout.  Two months after rescuing global insurance giant AIG with an $85 billion loan, the government is talking to AIG about   potentially easing the terms of the loan, which the company and some of its shareholders consider much too costly  .         Options under discussion include lowering the interest rate or lengthening the credit line&amp;#039;s two-year term, sources familiar with the discussions said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are private...Another possibility is   having the government assume billions of dollars of financial guarantees   that put AIG in peril and prompted the government&amp;#039;s September intervention...                      LOL!  Now that government has put your skin &amp;amp;quot;in the game&amp;amp;quot; it will inevitably have no choice but to continue with the collusion under the guise of &amp;amp;quot;saving its investment.&amp;amp;quot;      This about says it all:         Quote:                          But former AIG chairman Maurice R. &amp;amp;quot;Hank&amp;amp;quot; Greenberg, a major shareholder, made the case for federal forbearance in an interview yesterday, saying the costs associated with the $85 billion loan pose a potentially crushing burden for the company.         &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s clear that the original terms as the government negotiated with AIG . . . were so draconian that it would be impossible for the taxpayers to be repaid,&amp;amp;quot; Greenberg said.                        Enjoy taking on that second or third job to make the income needed to hand over to the government to support the extant big government boondoggle and the trillion in new boondoggle spending.
