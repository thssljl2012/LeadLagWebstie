 Edited on Tue Nov-11-08 08:15 AM by UpInArms          http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2008/11/10/paulso...  /   The Treasury is injecting another $27 billion into AIG and raising the taxpayers&amp;amp;#8217; investment to $150 billion. Secretary Paulson appears more intent on helping his pals on Wall Street than protecting taxpayer interests.  &amp;amp;lt;snip&amp;amp;gt;  The $123 billion was not enough to finance AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s short-term credit default swap obligations, and it cannot sell enough pieces of its good insurance businesses to pay back the Federal Reserve in the current environment.  Now, the Federal Reserve and Treasury are agreeing to restructure $60 billion of the original loan, lowering the interest rate to 3 percent above Libor and invest about another $27 billion AIG.  The interest rates on the loans were lowered, in part, because large shareholders complained about heavy handed government action.  The monies will be used to set up two special funds. The first will seek to buy up some of the CDOs that have declined in value for about 50 cents on the dollar, permitting AIG to recoup its collateral paid in cash. This fund will not buy up the most troubled CDOs, whose values are even lower than 50 cents on the dollar.  The second fund will be used to solve liquidity problems at AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s securities lending business. It rents securities to short sellers in the stock markets.  This is all folly.  &amp;amp;lt;snip&amp;amp;gt;  If AIG can&amp;amp;#8217;t make it on the money the taxpayers have already apparently squandered, then the Treasury should simply exercise its warrants, take control of AIG, and sell off AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s solid insurance businesses for what they are worth. The Treasury can buy back the CDOs for common shares in the company and reorganize the new AIG with more responsible management.  The executives at AIG certainly have not behaved well since the first bailout. They have enjoyed lavish golf retreats in California and luxurious hunting trips in Britain.  ...more...
