Our operating performance continues to improve, with a significant increase in the profitability of our auto and commercial insurance activities during the quarter, said president and CEO Charles Brindamour.    http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081110.waig1110/BNStory/Business/  U.S. provides record aid to AIG In early October AIG said it would sell certain business units to pay off the $85-billion Fed loan. The company, however, said it plans to retain its U.S. property-and-casualty and foreign general insurance businesses. It also plans to keep an ownership interest in its foreign life-insurance operations.    So, ING gets profits from P&amp;amp;amp;C Insurance and AIG is willing to give up everything but P&amp;amp;amp;C insurance.... Kingsway is valued at under half book value? What is Kingsway worth? What metrics are being applied to AIG and ING that don&amp;#039;t apply to KFS? What am I missing.... Someone please help. KFS while having a bad year (or two (or three(..))) still has a going concern managed business that writes policies and pays claims (they just got to get that pricing correct!). A going concern is much better then.... a start up?
