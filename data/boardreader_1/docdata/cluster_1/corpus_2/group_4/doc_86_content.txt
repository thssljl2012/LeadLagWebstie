 CWEI Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 5              Barrons tells what happened at American International Group..    We all know that the fed stepped in to prevent a bankruptcy at American International Group  and has put up over $115 billion as one gigantic margin call so far to stabilize the situation.  IMO now it looks like there may be some recovery for the taxpayer in this case. Much depends on a good economic recovery.  My question is will the PPT really get involved and right now?   http://online.barrons.com/article/SB122671604643530511.html?mod=9_0031_b_this_weeks_magazine_main&amp;amp;page=2&amp;amp;page=sp&amp;amp;page=sp   .....   AIG&amp;#039;S FATAL MISSTEPS OCCURRED in 2005 and early 2006 when the head of its financial-products unit, Joe Cassano, pushed the insurer into writing credit insurance  on some $60 billion of subprime collateralized debt obligations. The premiums on these CDOs were somewhat fatter than for other classes of credit risk,  but AIG&amp;#039;s risk models indicated that there was no chance of any loss claims being filed on them. After all, they were insuring only the super senior triple-A  portion of the securitization, and many risk layers below that would have to be burned through before any loss reached AIG.    Cassano, the son of a New York City cop who grew up in Brooklyn, had a big incentive to make his case. Top management in his unit got 30% of the operating  earnings they produced for the parent company. And in the wake of the management upheaval that had hit American International Group in early 2005, when  longtime CEO Hank Greenberg was ousted, new management was counting on the more than $1 billion in operating earnings that Cassano promised to deliver.    By early 2006, even Cassano was nervous over the widespread rumors and reports of slipshod underwriting and fraud in the subprime-mortgage market. AIG stopped  insuring subprime paper. But it was too late. Prices on 2005 vintage subprime mortgage paper began to drop in earnest in the secondary market by 2007,  forcing AIG to mark down the value of its obligations, even though it had next to no insurance claims on the $60 billion. Over four quarters, the writedowns  exceeded $33 billion.    EVEN WORSE, THE STEADY drumbeat of writedowns led to several credit downgrades that permitted AIG&amp;#039;s counterparties to demand ever more collateral, starting  in the summer of 2007. The margin calls eventually rose to $50 billion by September when AIG was downgraded to single-A.    At that point, American International Group had no choice but to seek a government bailout. The company was frozen out of the commercial paper market and  so couldn&amp;#039;t meet its short-term liquidity needs. It also had suffered losses of about $20 billion on $40 billion of cash collateral that hedge funds and  other traders had left with it in return for borrowing stocks and bonds from its life-insurance units to sell short.    To earn a fatter return, AIG had invested the cash in subprime and Alt-A mortgage paper, which promptly crashed in value. The short-sellers, who had covered  their positions and returned the stock, were clamoring for their money.    Thus for AIG, it was no longer just a matter of illiquidity. The company was effectively insolvent. It lacked the money to even make payroll or keep the  lights on without aid from Uncle Sam. A once- proud company was laid low by bad bets in the credit-default-swap market by an obscure, 300-person unit.  Cassano, by the way, was fired by AIG in February, but kept on for a while as a $1-million-a-month consultant, according to testimony last month from AIG  executives before an incredulous congressional panel looking into the insurer&amp;#039;s near-collapse.    The cautionary tale of American International Group and reforms taking place in the CDS market argue that these once-obscure products are subsiding as a  potential trigger of further mayhem.    Trouble usually arises from unexpected quarters. As the old army saw goes, a soldier never hears the round that gets him. Where the next bullet will come  from -- and whose name will be on it -- is unknown. But it probably will be from someplace other than the credit-default-swap market.
