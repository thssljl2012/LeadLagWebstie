You have another invitation from MetLife at 5 star resort for a golf weekend. Where are you going to go?      I&amp;#039;m not saying I understand the insurance business or that I know how important wining and dining clients is to their sales business. But I do know that lots of companies use weekend getaways as a way of selling their products to a captive audience.      So, now we&amp;#039;re in a situation where the government is making decisions about how to best sell insurance.       If AIG is spending $300K to secure maybe $300 Mil of business then that&amp;#039;s probably good business.      If you had to make a sales pitch to some clients would you take them to McDonalds or to the best restaurant in town? Sure, you save a few dollars at McDonalds but then you risk losing huge amounts business. Makes no sense.                      That makes perfect sense Mow, but the problem in this case is that a few of these retreats are for AIG executives, and is not as a means to attract nor retain present/future clients.  That level of spending I can understand, and it is (unfortunately) necessary to run that type of business.      But a $500,000 retreat for some of their top sellers and executives, while good for them, was not something that should&amp;#039;ve went through considering they fund the thing with bailout money.  Neither was the hunting trip for executives, nor the other spa getaway for other executives.      Seminars and functions held for training purposes and to attract client is more than reasonable.  Executive retreats is not when a company is staying alive through tax money.  I don&amp;#039;t think anyone really cares if they do such things with their own money, but at this precarious point in time, it&amp;#039;s not altogether the best move.      As for retaining clients, I&amp;#039;m not so sure if I&amp;#039;m a prospective client of theirs that I would have high confidence in their management if they are throwing away money to their executives while barely staying alive right now.
