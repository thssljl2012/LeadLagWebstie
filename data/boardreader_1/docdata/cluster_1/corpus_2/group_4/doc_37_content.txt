How exactly are we robbing the poor to give to the rich again? Because we aren&amp;#039;t taxing them to pay ALL of the burden?   I mean... it is a really sweet argument and whatnot... and the current bailouts make an argument... unless you do any investigation at all as to how this happened.   You cannot take what someone else has earned, and give it to someone who refuses to earn... because YOU feel it is unfair that they are successful. How do you justify that?                      Thank goodness.  Finally someone comes to the defense of America&amp;#039;s poor beleaguered billionaires.  They&amp;#039;ve been so poorly represented these last eight years, except for every single branch of our government.       It&amp;#039;s so unfair to expect the super-rich investor class to pay taxes.  It&amp;#039;s not like they derive any benefit from government services like roads, education and health care.    If our country is in financial trouble it&amp;#039;s all the fault of the working poor and the unions, not the corporate CEOs and Wall Street tycoons.        And why should billionaires pay taxes to help support the lazy good for nothing 6.5% of Americans who can&amp;#039;t find work because America&amp;#039;s CEOs outsourced their jobs to China.  They knew what they were doing when they got themselves laid off in the first place, so let em starve and their little brats too.  They should have had the good sense to be born into a wealthy family or at least get a good job like old Joe Cassano (below).       I know you don&amp;#039;t have a problem using taxpayer dollars to help good old Joe out to the tune of $1 million a month.              Quote:                         Joe Cassano: The Man Who Brought Down AIG?   Moments ago, members of the House oversight committee concluded their hammering of the two most recent AIG chief executives. Topic: Joe Cassano, the man who some credit with bringing down the insurance giant.      Cassano was president of AIG&amp;#039;s financial products division, which trafficked in the credit-default swaps, or CDS, which we learned earlier proved so dangerous.       Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) angrily recited the tale of Cassano&amp;#039;s tape: He earned $280 million in cash -- more than AIG chief executives -- and for every dollar his financial products unit made, 30 cents came back to Cassano and other top execs.      After the unit lost $11 billion, Cassano was fired Feb. 29 of this year, Braley pointed out, and got to keep $34 million in bonuses and was kept on as an AIG consultant at a salary of $1 million per month.       Braley asked the witnesses, former AIG chief executives Michael Sullivan and Robert    Willumstad, if they had exercised their authority to fire Cassano from his consultant&amp;#039;s role, given all the damage he had brought to AIG.      &amp;amp;quot;No,&amp;amp;quot; both said.      Then oversight committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) really lit into them.      Asked why they didn&amp;#039;t fire Cassano, Sullivan said they needed to &amp;amp;quot;retain the 20-year knowledge of the transactions.&amp;amp;quot;      Waxman was impressed.       &amp;amp;quot;When I retire I want to come work for you at $1 million a month,&amp;amp;quot; he said, The Post&amp;#039;s Peter Whoriskey reports.      &amp;amp;quot;What would he have had to have done for you to fire him?&amp;amp;quot; Waxman asked rhetorically.      - Frank Ahrens    http://voices.washingtonpost.com/liv...ho_brough.html
