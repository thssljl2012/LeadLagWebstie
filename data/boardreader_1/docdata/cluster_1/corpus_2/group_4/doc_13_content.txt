They are a commercial organisation and a provider of insurance, why wouldnt they sponsor sporting teams like any other services provider?      Its ok for SGIO, NRMA etc (Insurance Companies) but not AIG?      In light of recent events, getting their brand out in a positive light is probably even more important - maybe thats why they pulled out of the Tigers deal
