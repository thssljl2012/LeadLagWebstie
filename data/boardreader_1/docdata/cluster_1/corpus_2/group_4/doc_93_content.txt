 Update :         Quote:                         The  Wall Street Journal , citing sources familiar with the matter, reported Sunday evening that AIG&amp;#039;s board was close to approving significant changes to the terms of the $123 billion in loans extended so far, and might announce a revised $150 billion deal as early as Monday.    Details were still in flux, but under the plan being discussed Sunday night, thegovernment would cut the interest rate AIG is paying and use its authority under last month&amp;#039;s $700 billion bailout law to buy $40 billion in preferred shares, the  Journal  said.           The government would also stand behind billions of dollars in credit default swap agreements   - essentially insurance contracts that AIG had sold to customers worldwide, according to the  Journal . Finally, it would backstop AIG&amp;#039;s business of securities lending.                     LOL!  Hi!  I am from the gub&amp;#039;met and I am here to help.  Make sure to take on that third or fourth job and immediately deposit all proceeds of said work with your local patriotic dues collection office.  The gub&amp;#039;met will be needing your productivity to &amp;amp;quot;backstop&amp;amp;quot; AIG.
