You have another invitation from MetLife at 5 star resort for a golf weekend. Where are you going to go?      I&amp;#039;m not saying I understand the insurance business or that I know how important wining and dining clients is to their sales business. But I do know that lots of companies use weekend getaways as a way of selling their products to a captive audience.      So, now we&amp;#039;re in a situation where the government is making decisions about how to best sell insurance.       If AIG is spending $300K to secure maybe $300 Mil of business then that&amp;#039;s probably good business.      If you had to make a sales pitch to some clients would you take them to McDonalds or to the best restaurant in town? Sure, you save a few dollars at McDonalds but then you risk losing huge amounts business. Makes no sense.                      I never thought I&amp;#039;d say this... but your exactly right.      Most people don&amp;#039;t understand high stakes business.  It&amp;#039;s not always about how much money you can potentially make for someone.  A huge part is about the investors trusting you.  If they&amp;#039;re going to invest 500 million dollars with you, they HAVE to trust you.  And they won&amp;#039;t trust you if they don&amp;#039;t like you.  That&amp;#039;s why you spend 2k on a dinner or 300k on a retreat.  It makes them like you.
