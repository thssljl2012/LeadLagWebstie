I think you will find that this &amp;amp;quot;AIG&amp;amp;quot; is not the same as that &amp;amp;quot;AIG&amp;amp;quot;.   Two completely separate companies according to press releases I saw at   the time of the &amp;amp;quot;bailout&amp;amp;quot;. *With only 3 letters in the name it&amp;#039;s no   wonder there are duplicates. *I think A for Aircraft and A for   American in this case, but my attention span is short and I didn&amp;#039;t   verify that.     Andy      If I understand it correctly, AIG Aviation Inc is part of the larger  AIG holding company, however, owing to regulatory insurance  requirements, there were specific reserve requirements that were not  related to the financials of the larger AIG holding company.  At no  time were coverage and claims in danger.  If the larger AIG had not  been bailed out, AIG Aviation may have been sold off to another  group.  Assistant VP of AIG Aviation spoke to this at the recent SSA  board meeting. As to which would have been the better long term  solution, well.....    Frank Whiteley
