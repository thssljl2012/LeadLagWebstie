AIG is a conglomerate of many, many small insurance companies.  These worked independently in their own fields.  Some sold business insurance, some car, etc. Some were local companies.  All these companies were doing very well.  Completely financially sound.      On the corporate side, where large investments were made, they were selling CDS etc.  That's where the problem was.  My point was that those parts of the business that were doing well should not be thrown out with the bad.            thread start
