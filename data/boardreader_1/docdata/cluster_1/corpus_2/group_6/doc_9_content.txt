   "Hank" Greenberg, AIG insurance group                                Now aged 83, Hank - AKA Maurice - was the boss of AIG. He built the business into the world's biggest insurer. AIG had a vast business in credit default swaps and therefore a huge exposure to a residential mortgage crisis. When AIG's own credit-rating was cut, it faced a liquidity crisis and needed an $85bn (47bn then) bail out from the US government to avoid collapse and avert the crisis its collapse would have caused. It later needed  many more billions from the US treasury and the Fed , but that did not stop senior AIG executives taking themselves off for a few  lavish trips , including a $444,000 golf and spa retreat in California and an $86,000 hunting expedition to England. "Have you heard of anything more outrageous?" said Elijah Cummings, a Democratic congressman from Maryland. "They were getting their manicures, their facials, pedicures, massages while the American people were footing the bill."
