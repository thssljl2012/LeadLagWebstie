Is this part of XFP/MKS's AIGLIH?        yes it is part of AIGLIH - I believe it falls under the main regulated insurance sub (AGC Life Insurance Co.&amp;nbsp;       Not sure what if any effect it has on XFP although some of us speculated that AIGLIH subs were not pledged so as to make it less cumbersome to sell legally.&amp;nbsp; IMHO, AIG is still trying to sell its domestic US life insurance subs.      wabuffo               thread start
