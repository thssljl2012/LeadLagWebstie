 BofA CFO: Bank is financially strong    Bank of America CFO Price says company is financially strong despite industrywide concerns        CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) -- Bank of America Corp. Chief Financial Officer Joe Price assured employees Friday the company has enough cash to finance operations for more than two years.      "Market turmoil has created lingering industrywide concerns that magnify the importance of maintaining an extra level of capital to support business activities," Price said in a question and answer dialogue posted on the company's Intranet site.      He added, "We currently have enough cash on hand to fund our parent company operations for more than two years without having to issue additional debt during that time."      Price went on to say Bank of America believes it has the best deposit franchise in the world, which is a "very cost-effective funding source," and that the company's liquidity "continues to be strong despite the difficult market environment."       http://finance.yahoo.com/news/BofA-C...-14353498.html
