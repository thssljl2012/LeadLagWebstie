  AIG carries on...and on, and on   Now, ain&amp;#039;t this a pip?    QUOTE   Less than a week after the federal government committed &amp;amp;#036;85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.   Not all of the &amp;amp;#036;85 billion that went to AIG was used to save the company.&amp;amp;quot;Rooms at this resort can cost over &amp;amp;#036;1,000 a night,&amp;amp;quot; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.   AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid more than &amp;amp;#036;440,000 for the retreat, including nearly &amp;amp;#036;200,000 for rooms, &amp;amp;#036;150,000 for meals and &amp;amp;#036;23,000 in spa charges.   &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).      I tell you, I can&amp;#039;t decide whether I&amp;#039;m not at all surprised, or whether I&amp;#039;m too astonished at their incredible arrogance to know one way or the other&amp;amp;#33;  So, apparently having learned not a damned thing from their recent near-bankruptcy, AIG execs take a break from all that executive stress by toddling off for a week at a luxury resort. Isn&amp;#039;t this just too fabulous for them? I can picture them all sitting in the steam room, sipping their cocktails and laughing their asses off at how stupid we all are for giving them yet more money to piss away.  Is this the sort of behavior we can expect from the rest of the Wall Street fat cats, now that they&amp;#039;ve safely got &amp;amp;#036;700 billion of our money in their pockets? Are those people really that stupid and insensitive, or are they just screwing with us yet again? And how long do you think it&amp;#039;ll be before we start seeing actual bloodshed over this kind of crap? (Me, I give it about a week before someone snaps and blows away a CEO or two...)   (Around these parts, AIG is known as &amp;amp;quot;Assholes in Groups&amp;amp;quot;...more apt than ever&amp;amp;#33;)    Post was edited by  Vix : 8 Oct 08 06:39
