Feeling Robbed? Wall Street Since the Bailout Shows No Signs of Changing and Washington is Not Forcing a Change      By Kevin Zeese       The first post-bailout outrage was the massive insurance giant AIG. After receiving an $84 billion tax payer bailout they had a party for their executives  the cost $440,000. There was outrage on Capitol Hill including threats to get the money back. They were getting their manicures, their pedicures, massages, their facials while the American people were paying their bills, thundered Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-MD). But, instead the Federal Reserve gave them $38 billion more after their party.         http://freshaircleanpolitics.net/#5
