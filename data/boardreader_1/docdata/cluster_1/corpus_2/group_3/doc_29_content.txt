   White House calls AIG spa trip despicable   WASHINGTON - The White House said on Wednesday it was &amp;amp;quot;despicable&amp;amp;quot; that American International Group Inc. executives spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a posh California retreat just days after getting a federal bailout.   Lawmakers investigating the meltdown of AIG said the retreat didn&amp;#039;t include anyone from the financial products division that nearly drove the company under, but they were still enraged that executives of AIG&amp;#039;s main U.S. life insurance subsidiary spent $440,000 on the retreat, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings.   &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s pretty despicable,&amp;amp;quot; White House press secretary Dana Perino said.
