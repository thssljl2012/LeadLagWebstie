          My problem is that I don&amp;#039;t know if it is very safe to buy this policy from a company which is owned by AIG.    I don&amp;#039;t think (reasonably sure) that AIG&amp;#039;s insurance subsidiaries are in nearly as bad a position as the parent company and its subsidiaries that were heavily involved in credit swaps/insuring sub-prime loans.  www.ambest.com  rates AIG&amp;#039;s Life and Health Insurance subsidiaries A (Excellent), with a downgrade under review - I suspect likely because the parent company is in so much financial stress.   Does anyone know of a similar deal from any other company?   A lot of insurers offer guaranteed issue life insurance policies that don&amp;#039;t require a physical - many applications ask some health questions that must be answered honestly to avoid reciscion. Many policies have a 2-year waiting period before paying full benefits, during which your beneficiary is paid only return of premium plus a bit of a return on the amount paid.  You *might* look into HSBC as a possible alternative. I&amp;#039;m not very familiar with them, at all - just ran a search and checked their A.M. Best rating:  http://local.ingenio.com/Service/Call-HSBC-Term-Life-Insuran...   I don&amp;#039;t know which of their subsidiaries they use for their no-medical life product here:  HSBC Life (International) Limited is rated A+ HSBC Life (UK) Limited is rated B++  Note: If a life insurance company is an  Admitted carrier, policy death benefits are pretty commonly covered up to $300,000 under most State Insurance Insolvency Funds - I didn&amp;#039;t check the particular State in which you live for this provision.
