 Time for a Second Look at Life Settlements   By Wm. Scott Page      Benjamin Franklin said in this world, nothing is certain but death   and taxes.         Because death is certain and has no correlation to the stock market,   today represents an excellent time for hedge fund managers to take   another look at life insurance settlements.         Life settlements are not new to the hedge fund world as many managers   identified the investment vehicle early on as a solid and steady   alternative to market fluctuations.  Others have stayed on the   sidelines because they believe the industry needed maturation and   greater market acceptance.         As financial conventions fall by the wayside in this tumultuous year,   the life settlement industry looks more attractive than ever.         As a quick primer, life settlement companies buy insurance policies   at   a heavy discount from seniors who either can no longer afford or no   longer wish to own permanent life insurance.  The life settlement   pays   more than the cash surrender value to the seller, and the investor   holds the policy until maturation, earning the full death benefit.   Creating a diversified portfolio of policies from a number of sellers   spreads the risk, and such portfolios have proven to offer a yield of   8-11 percent per year.  By some estimates, the industry might be soon   buying $10 billion worth of life insurance per year.         The underlying reasons to invest in life settlements havent changed,   but the industrys growth and evolution are a key reason why it   deserves a second look.         Here are the five main reasons that hedge fund managers should   consider investing in life settlements.         1.      Non-correlated assets that can generate an attractive yield.   The   markets have little effect on life settlement yields.  One of the key   aspects of a life settlement is that the investor earns a payout on   the demise of the policyholder.  The strength or weakness of the   stock   market does not impact the life settlement arena.  Diversified   portfolios have been performing well.         2.      Life settlement assets are backed by highly rated financial   institutions.  Life settlements are performed on policies held by   carriers with A.M. Best ratings of _ _ _ or better, so the payouts   are   regulated and solid.  It is important to note that the life insurance   industry remains healthy despite the problems at carriers like AIG,   where the main business lines were solid.         3.      Trading platforms exist.  Several household name   institutions   have developed or are developing platforms to trade life settlement   policies and portfolios.  Smaller markets also exist, so this is no   longer a strictly buy and hold investment.         4.      Securitization is on the horizon.  Though it may not be this   year,   securitization is definitely in the future for life settlements.   Portfolio analysis comprising the past several years proves that life   settlement portfolios will perform predictably and generate   consistent   cash flow.  It remains an attractive candidate for securitization.         5.      Third party tracking, servicing and underwriting simplify the   investment.  In a sign of a maturing industry, life settlements are   not necessarily managed by one-stop shops anymore.  The size and   scope   has made it profitable for third party companies to manage tracking,   servicing and some underwriting, thus easing entry by financial   players.         For fund managers looking for non-correlated opportunities during   these trying times, life settlements might be the answer.                   Reply    Reply to author    Forward
