But it&amp;#039;s normal business as stated above, and the beneficiaries were the independent agents, not just executives.      It was a seperate division of AIG that got into deep kim-chi with Credit Default Swaps that tanked the balance sheet (but not their profitable businesses).      Also, the Gov bought 80% of AIG, including their considerable assets, for pennies on the dollar.  They weren&amp;#039;t just given money.  Unraveling their Credit default Swap business will be a chore, but that ownership stake will likely profit to taxpayers, IMHO.         Still an ugly affair.                      +1. It was really stupid of them to go ahead with this thing right now, which was probably planned well in advance. They should be embarrassed as hell for doing it. But that $440,000 represents 0.05% of the company&amp;#039;s current, very depressed market value.
