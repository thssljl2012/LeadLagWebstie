They prob would have charged a massive fee to postpone the event.  Also, In the interest of continuing to run AIG&amp;#039;s insurance subsidiaries profitably, they need to retain their sales force...in this case the producers.  Canceling/postponing the trip would likely anger the producers/agents, who would be likely to move business away from AIG and to other carriers.                      Wow, someone with a brain.      These guys are serious rain makers and they bring substantial profits to AIG.       It had nothing to do with taking advantage of the tax payers.      And Obama said they should lose their jobs.    AIG can&amp;#039;t even fire them because they are not employees.  They are independent life insurance agents.        I&amp;#039;m not even sure life insurance is an issue with the bailout.
