 AIG Spa Trip Fuels Fury on Hill    http://www.washingtonpost....02604.html    --Lawmakers Blast Them About Bonuses 08 Oct 2008 For some   people at AIG, the insurance giant rescued last month with   an $85 billion federal bailout, the good times keep rolling.   Joseph Cassano, the financial products manager whose complex   investments led to American International Group&amp;#039;s near   collapse, is receiving $1 million a month in consulting   fees. Former chief executive Martin J. Sullivan, whose   three-year tenure coincided with much of the company&amp;#039;s   ill-fated risk-taking, is receiving a $5 million performance   bonus. Last week, about 70 of the company&amp;#039;s top performers   were rewarded with a week-long stay at the luxury St. Regis   Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., where they ran up a tab of   $440,000.      =========================================   Remember...  &amp;amp;quot;When you ride alone   You ride with Cheney!&amp;amp;quot;   =========================================
