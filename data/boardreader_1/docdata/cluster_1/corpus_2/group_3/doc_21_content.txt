  While the states regulate AIG&amp;#039;s insurance companies, I still would shy away from holding an AIG policy. If the @#$ hits the fan, the holding company will roll up the cash from the insurance companies and stop doing business. Once the cash is gone, even the state insurance departments can&amp;#039;t get it back...except for the small amounts deposited with the state.
