                               I&amp;#039;m having a hard time choosing a company for Life Insurance. My husband and I are both working on getting life insurance and originally signed paperwork to go with AIG. Is this a bad move? Can anyone recommend companies out there that would be a better choice? (i.e: Banner, Prudential, West Coast, United of Omaha, etc) Would love any feedback! Thanks!
