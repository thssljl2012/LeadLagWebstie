 Oh, don&amp;#039;t you just love it? Even after the heat for the &amp;amp;quot;retreat&amp;amp;quot; to a posh resort in California, they STILL pull stunts like this.        AIG spent thousands on execs hunting trip      UK vacation happened as insurer asked for billions more in federal loans      CHARLOTTE, North Carolina - A handful of top executives from American International Group Inc. spent thousands of dollars during a recent English hunting trip, even as the New York-based insurer asked for an additional $37.8 billion loan from the Federal Reserve.     &amp;amp;quot;This was an annual event for customers of the AIG property casualty insurance companies in the U.K. and Europe, and  planned months before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&amp;#039;s loan to AIG, &amp;amp;quot; company spokesman Peter Tulupman said Wednesday.     AIG officials declined to say which AIG executives attended the trip, which reports have said racked up an $86,000 tab. News of the trip surfaced just days after AIG received an additional $37.8 billion loan from the Federal Reserve, on top of a previous $85 billion emergency loan granted last month.     ________________________________________     My question is, had your asses gone bankrupt, would you STILL take the trip because it was planned months in advance of the bankruptcy?     Pathetic and disgraceful.
