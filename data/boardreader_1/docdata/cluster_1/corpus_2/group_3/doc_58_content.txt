  Hey, so long as we tax payers keep paying the tab, why the hell not?      CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) &amp;amp;#8212;  A handful of top executives from American International Group Inc. spent thousands of dollars during a recent English hunting trip, even as the New York-based insurer  asked for an additional $37.8 billion loan  from the Federal Reserve.      &amp;amp;quot;This was an annual event for customers of the AIG property casualty insurance companies in the U.K. and Europe, and planned months before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&amp;#039;s loan to AIG,&amp;amp;quot; company spokesman Peter Tulupman said Wednesday morning.      In a prepared statement later in the day, the company said, &amp;amp;quot;We will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure that these activities cease immediately. AIG&amp;#039;s priority is to continue focusing on actions necessary to repay the Federal Reserve loan and emerge as a vital, ongoing business.&amp;amp;quot;      AIG officials declined to say which AIG executives attended the trip, which reports have said racked up an $86,000 tab. News of the hunting trip surfaced just days after AIG received an additional $37.8 billion loan from the Federal Reserve, on top of a previous $85 billion emergency loan granted last month.       PS: By the way, the bailout has not reached $2.2 trillion.      See Below ----&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;
