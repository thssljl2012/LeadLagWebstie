I&amp;#039;m sure AIG&amp;#039;s core insurance business are sound (the ones they sell to you and me). They have a reputation for fighting the Hell out of paying claims, and paying all but senior management pennies.       Where they got in trouble was Hank Greenberg&amp;#039;s insatiable greed.   Through use of derivative (particularly credit default swaps) instruments, they were basically insuring themselves (in the form of one of their subsidiaries).       They also fudged fake transactions (Enron, anyone?) to make it look like they had adequate loan loss reserves (which, you know, the law requires of insurers...who knew?).   They didn&amp;#039;t. Result? 1.6BB settlement, and Greenberg&amp;#039;s gone.       David Schiff chronicled most of this throughout the years, in &amp;amp;quot;Schiff&amp;#039;s Insurance Observer.&amp;amp;quot;       They&amp;#039;re effing crooks, and have been since Greenberg got his slimy hands on the company in the 60&amp;#039;s.                      Interesting post. Thanks
