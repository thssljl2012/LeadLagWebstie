Would you say Comedy Central shouldn&amp;#039;t reward it&amp;#039;s employees if the channel is profitable, but Viacom isn&amp;#039;t? Viacom is responsible for managing it&amp;#039;s subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are separate entities and should not be held responsible for the parent company&amp;#039;s wrongdoings.                      If the parent corporation can&amp;#039;t stay afloat without an 80 billion dollar loan then it is time to cut out the $400,000 retreats at St.Regis. They are one company when it actually counts, like when discussing the bottom line.
