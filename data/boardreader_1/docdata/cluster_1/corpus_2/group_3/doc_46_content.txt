       Division of Insurance For  Immediate Release            September 16, 2008    Contact; Cameron Lewis, Colorado Division of Insurance,  303.894.2261    Chris Lines, DORA  Public Information Officer, 303.894.7873    Colorado Insurance Commissioner Responds to AIG Financial  News   -----------------        The news about AIG    s financial situation has rippled through the  country, but in the insurance arena, Colorado&amp;#039;s Insurance Commissioner has a      positive  message     for consumers.          &amp;amp;quot;If you have a policy with an AIG insurance company, they are  solvent and have the capability to pay claims. The states&amp;#039; regulatory structure  is working, exactly as it should, to protect the assets of the subsidiary  insurance companies,&amp;amp;quot; said Marcy Mbrrison, Commissioner of  Insurance.      &amp;amp;quot;Although the  parentcompany, AlG, is  dealing with significant financial issues,     the holding company  cannot  reach  into the insurance         companies and use their  assets    , because the  insurance  companies are fully regulated by the states and the consumers&amp;#039; interests are  protected.&amp;amp;quot;      State insurance,  regulators from across the country participated in a conference call Tuesday  afternoon, reiterating the job of the states is to ensure that the insurance  companies involved continue to have the ability to pay claims, and confirming  that AIG&amp;#039;s    financial problems are  not with the insurance companies it owns.  &amp;amp;quot;There is plenty  of liquidity in the insurance side of AIG,&amp;amp;quot; Morrison said.     And importantly, those liquid assets are  clearly protected from the financial needs of the parent  company.  As far as insurance claims, the  companies will remain solvent.&amp;amp;quot;  State insurance  regulators described their role in the AIG solvency situation as one as  watchman. &amp;amp;quot;We are not acting as firemen, putting out a fire,&amp;amp;quot; Morrison said. &amp;amp;quot;We  are guarding a carefully built safe, and the contents are protected due to the  regulatory  structure around  it.&amp;amp;quot;
