       STT, MET and insurers - Business cannot be good for insurers. They are in the &amp;amp;quot;confidence&amp;amp;quot; business and with a stock chart that looks like a black hole, how are they going to close on long term insurance contracts? Everybody who is in the &amp;amp;quot;confidence business&amp;amp;quot; like Banks, insurers, money managers, hedge funds etc. are in big trouble. I closed a term life insurance contract with Transamercia last year (runner up was AIG direct) and keep on checking their stock quote (Aegon owns them) every time I sent them my monthly payment.  The health insurers are somewhat better off because their contracts are short term in nature, IMO  I think eventually the government needs to backstop everything in the &amp;amp;quot;confidence business&amp;amp;quot; , banks, money managers, insurers, commercial paper issuers etc. to break the viscous circle of distrust that stall the whole economy.  I sold STT for a smallish loss today near the intraday height - one of my &amp;amp;quot;lucky&amp;amp;quot; trades today. Bought some UL today on the rapid fall because i figure that people still will eat some food going forward.
