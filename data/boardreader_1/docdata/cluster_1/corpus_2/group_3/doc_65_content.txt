=DJ AIG CEO: Retreat Criticized By Dems Wasn&amp;#039;t For Its Employees         DOW JONES NEWSWIRES       American International Group Inc. (AIG) Chief Executive Edward M. Liddy said a subsidiary&amp;#039;s event that was criticized during a House committee hearing Tuesday was for top independent agents, not employees.     In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Liddy said the agents were top business producers for the company, and of the 100 attendees, only 10 were employees of the subsidiary.     &amp;amp;quot;No AIG executives from headquarters attended,&amp;amp;quot; the letter said, also noting that the meeting was planned months before the federal government gave the insurance giant an $85 billion loan to help it survive a liquidity crisis.     During testimony by former AIG executives before the House Government Oversight Committee, some Democrats complained that less than a week after the federal bailout, AIG held a weeklong retreat at the pricey St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., where rooms can cost more than $1,000 a night. Invoices distributed by the House committee show AIG paid more than $440,000 to the resort, including nearly $7,000 for golf and $23,000 in spa charges.     In the letter to Paulson, Liddy also said AIG is re-evaluating all expenses and &amp;amp;quot;is focused on doing what is necessary to address our capital structure, repay the Fed credit facility and emerge as a healthy global insurer.&amp;amp;quot;     He also noted the company&amp;#039;s insurance businesses continue to operate normally     AIG&amp;#039;s shares recently traded at $3.33, down 5.1%.       -By Kathy Shwiff, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5975;  Kathy.Shwiff@dowjones.com        Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today&amp;#039;s most important business and market news, analysis and commentary:  http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=77z...NSIfQT9w%3D%3D .
