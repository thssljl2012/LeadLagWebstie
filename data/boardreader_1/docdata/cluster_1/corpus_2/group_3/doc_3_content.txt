&amp;quot;AIG issued a statement Wednesday saying that the &amp;quot;business event&amp;quot; was planned months before the Sept. 16 bailout and that it was held for top-producing independent life insurance agents, not AIG employees. Of the 100 attendees, only 10 worked for the AIG unit hosting the event, it said.&amp;quot;  This is being sensationalized, and I can understand why.  But it wasn&amp;#039;t for the &amp;quot;high-up executives&amp;quot; as everyone thinks.  It was just one of those fancy bonus retreats that are set up so that all those salesmen work their asses off to be eligible to attend at the end of the year.   http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081008/fed_aig.htm
