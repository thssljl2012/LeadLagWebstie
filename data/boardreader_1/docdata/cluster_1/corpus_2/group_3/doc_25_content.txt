If we fire them all, the $85b will never be repaid.  AIG must sell the life companies to repay the loan. If we fire the agents who went on this retreat, nobody will sell AIG&amp;#039;s insurance, and the life companies won&amp;#039;t sell for a fair price.(And yes, they earned it, they weren&amp;#039;t the ones who did the dumb investing.)  AIG&amp;#039;s life insurers are solid. So are its insurance policies. We need to keep them solid so we can get our $85b back (with interest).
