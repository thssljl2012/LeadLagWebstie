&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;A week after the insurance giant, the American International Group, received an $85 billion federal bailout, executives at its life insurance subsidiary, AIG General, held a weeklong retreat at the exclusive St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif. Expenses for the week, lawmakers were told, totaled $442,000, including $200,000 for hotel rooms, $150,000 for food and $23,000 in spa charges.&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;     http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/business/economy/08insure.html ?hp    Of course, AIG&amp;#039;s management is primarily to blame for this callous abuse of the public trust, but so, in my opinion, is the Government (Executive and Legislative branches, both) for not putting any limitations on how AIG could spend the $85 BILLION.
