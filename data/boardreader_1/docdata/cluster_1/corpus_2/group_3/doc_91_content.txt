Let&amp;#039;s put this very simply for all of you.   AIG did not become one of the biggest companies by making pure decisions.   AIG also is not perfect clearly. The markets terrible fluctuation made it incredibly difficult for AIG to maintain an A+ status like it usually did.  Which in turn made many many stockholders and insurance companies relinquish their relationship although they were still considered an A company.   The fear of those investers brought AIG down even more so then their &amp;quot;poor decisions&amp;quot; To make it a little clearer for you.   Big insurance companies need a certain amount of liquid money in order to hold accountability in case of a mass catastrophe so there will be money to pay out when something does go wrong in cities, massive business, people&amp;#039;s lives.   Without that liquid money, there would be no accountability and stability in insurance.   Their loss of money from the poor market and the pull out of investors is only the beginning.   The nature of the bail out is so that many many many companies, that I&amp;#039;m sure you are aware of, can still stay afloat for insurance and accountability purposes (over a 1000 companies, take this into perspective).   I&amp;#039;m not sure if you read AIG&amp;#039;s response to the claim of their wasteful spending. Any idea why AIG need&amp;#039;s to spend money on private insurance companies?   Because if they aren&amp;#039;t maintaining their connection with AIG, they will not be invested in, and they will fall to pieces, and so will our economy and countless business.   Believe it or not, it actually was a thoughtful and considered investment.   And if any of you, think, that this &amp;quot;retreat was planned post the bail out&amp;quot;, than you clearly haven&amp;#039;t read the full story.   They planned this retreat to maintain corporate relationships months in advanced.   Only 10 AIG members attended, while everyone else were from other private insurance companies and benefactors.   Companies like to be treated nicely by their private counterparts, it gives them a reason to keep doing business.   Don&amp;#039;t jump to conclusions and read the whole story next time
