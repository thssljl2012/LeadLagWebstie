http://www.kccllc.net/documents/0812229/0812229081223000000000028.pdf Some info on Bank of New York securities and US bank securities. I don't recall any securities, except 5.4 Million shares of class B Stock. Also mentions "1031 exchange entity". Wondering if WMI is doing an exchange for entities or real property. Mention of Marion Insurance Company, Inc., WM Mortgage Reinsurance Company, Inc., Genworth, and Hawaiian Captive Insurance. There is more.
