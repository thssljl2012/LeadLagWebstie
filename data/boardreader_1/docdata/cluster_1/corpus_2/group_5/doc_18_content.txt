AIG is a conglomarate of a variety of businesses. The AIG subsidiaries that are insurance companies are all most all doing very well. In fact many state insurance departments are coming down hard on agents for replacing AIG branded insurance based solely on the fact they are subsidiaries of AIG.                      Interesting approach by DOI protectionist's.  I guess since they/we now own 79.9% of the company, they don't want to lose out on the possibility of being repaid as taxpayers if retention is low...  Not much the DOI can say about replacement IF the client initiates the convo and demands replacement based on concern over AIG, or just being pissed about the bailout debacle, as many seem to be.     Saying AIG is not an ins co may be technically correct but they are certainly (heavily and predominately) in the ins biz... that statement is like saying that the Catholic Church doesn't sanction Bingo.       Here is what AIG's co profile states, in part:      American International Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries, provides insurance and financial services in the United States and internationally. It operates in four segments: General Insurance, Life Insurance and Retirement Services, Financial Services, and Asset Management.        So it sounds like 1) Insurance, 2) Insurance, 3) almost Insurance, and 4) nearly Insurance.  I'd call it INSURANCE myself.
