Troubled insurance giant AIG will be getting another handful of federal aid.   This financial assistance plan will include pouring $40 billion into the company in return for partial ownership. The action was announced jointly by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department.   The move boosts aid for AIG to around $150 billion. The $40 billion infusion comes from the recently enacted $700 billion financial bailout package.
