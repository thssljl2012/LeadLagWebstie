Insurance giant AIG took its top executives on another trip to a luxury resort last week. This comes after it was announced earlier this week that the company would receive another $21 billion from the government, which is a total of $150 billion worth of government bailout money.  AIG was one of the companies included in a huge billion-dollar bailout plan. The company held a financial planners conference last week at a posh Arizona resort. AIG said it was all part of a training conference.  AIGs CEO claims that advisors spent most of their days attending business meetings but the bill never lies. Hotel documents show there were also cocktail receptions and dinners. The trip cost around $400,000. AIG said it spent around $25,000 with the rest coming from sponsors and employees.
