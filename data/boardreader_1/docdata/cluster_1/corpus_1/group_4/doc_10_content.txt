Just after bailout money handed down  Created On: Wednesday, 12 Nov 2008, 1:41 PM CST  Scottsdale, Ariz. (NBC) - Flying in from all over the country, 150 advisors, and a handful of executives attended a two-day AIG conference at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort. Insurance giant AIG is defending its decision to hold a training conference at the exclusive Arizona resort just after receiving $150 billion in bailout money from Congress.  'They are the people who sell our products,' said AIG CEO Edward Liddy. 'It's important they know what our products are, who they are suitable to sell to. That's what this idea is, what that meeting was.'  Liddy said the advisors' days were full of business meetings, but internal hotel documents also show cocktail receptions, fancy dinners and a memo asking staff to shield the company by keeping AIG logos off meeting signs. Liddy said sponsors and attendees are picking up nearly all of the $340,000 tab. AIG estimates its total cost is under $25,000, but members of Congress are still questioning the wisdom and timing of the resort event.  'For them, asking for more money or needing more money to have an event like this I think is very inappropriate, really uncalled for,' said Rep. Harry Mitchell of Tempe, Ariz.
