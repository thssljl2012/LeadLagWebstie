The largest lender in the Philippines, Metropolitan Bank &amp;amp; Trust (Metrobank), has become the latest big-name to enter the race for the overseas assets of the beleaguered US giant American Insurance Group (AIG). On October 23, Metrobank confirmed that it wants to acquire AIG's local subsidiary, Philippine American Life and General Insurance (Philiamlife). The company is the largest insurer in the Philippines, and will be one of AIG's most prized operations in the region with around US$3.4bn in assets and a net worth of US$1bn at the end of 2007.
