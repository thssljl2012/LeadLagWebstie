China Life Insurance is likely to make a bid for the Asian assets of American International Group.  China Life executives have said the company is interested in buying parts of AIG's business, especially in Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.  AIG, once the world's biggest insurer, plans to sell most operations except for its worldwide property-casualty operations.  China Life is now the world's biggest life insurer by market value.
