UAE: AIG Private Bank, which has a branch in Dubai, has announced it will trim 28 per cent of its workforce worldwide due to credit crunch pressures. Around 120 of 420 jobs at Swiss-based AIG, owned by Abu Dhabi holding Aabar Investments, are to be axed. Up to 90 of those will be in Switzerland, the company has said. The independent asset manager was bought from troubled US insurance giant AIG last month.
