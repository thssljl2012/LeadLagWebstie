US insurance firm American International Group (AIG) will not be renewing its 14m ($19.8m) a year shirt sponsorship deal with English Premier League soccer champions Manchester United, which expires in May 2010 after four years.  The troubled US insurer is in the process of selling up to 70% of its business as it tries to pay off a $150bn bail-out from the Federal Bank of New York, which stepped in to prevent it filing for bankruptcy last September.  AIG has already ended a sponsorship deal with the American Davis Cup tennis team, and just days ago Manchester United chief executive David Gill admitted he would not be surprised if the insurer chose not to renew its deal with the club.  According to the BBC, AIG also has a 5m-a-year deal to run MU Finance, which offers insurance, credit cards and mortgages. A six-and-a-half year deal was signed at the start of 2008 and it is not yet clear whether that agreement will continue.
