Property-reinsurance rates in the United States  A January survey of 75 commercial-insurance buyers by   Jay Gelb  Six months ago, prices were falling because companies had lots of capital and were competing aggressively. However, the financial crisis has left some insurers with investment losses, reducing the amount of capital they have to underwrite new risks and making them less likely to cut rates.   No insurer was harder hit than AIG (AIG). The company was one of the largest in the industry and was influential in setting prices for many types of coverage. But AIG had to be bailed out by the government last year after derivative-based guarantees it sold on complex mortgage-related securities left it with huge losses.   With such an industry leader on the defensive and rates rising for several types of coverage, those companies that still have lots of capital could benefit. 'Having an aggressive price leader out of the market helps the remaining companies,' said Stewart Johnson  He's expecting price increases for personal auto insurance and some types of commercial coverage, such as directors and officers' insurance. 'There are certain lines of business where we expect to see price increases,' according to Johnson. 'This is better than even just three months ago.' KBW's Gallant expects financially strong insurers with global businesses to gain 'material' market share over the next two to three years.   Ace Ltd. (ACE), PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE),  (RE) and  (ACGL) are among Bermuda 'Rate increases are secondary to the obvious dislocation and change underfoot in the marketplace,' Gallant wrote in a note to investors Tuesday.   Some insurance buyers already are planning to switch from AIG to rivals, said Barclays Capital's Gelb.   About 85% of insurance buyers surveyed by Gelb use AIG for at least some of their coverage needs. Of these, 14% said they plan to move to another insurer, while 25% were unsure.
