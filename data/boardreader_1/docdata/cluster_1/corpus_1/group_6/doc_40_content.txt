SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Moody's Investors Service said Thursday it lowered the senior debt ratings of Bank of America Corp.  (BAC:  , , )  to Aa3 from Aa2, and the long-term bank deposits rating on Bank of America NA to Aa1 from Aaa. Moody's said it cut the bank financial strength rating on the lead bank two notches to B from A-, which translates to a change in the baseline credit assessment to Aa3 from Aa1. The rating outlook is negative. The ratings agency said the 'downgrade and negative outlook on Bank of America reflect Moody's view of the greater challenges Bank of America and Merrill Lynch are likely to face over the next few years under a more difficult economic environment.'
