The deal, which is expected to close by June 1, is part of the New York-based insurance giant's restructuring plans.  AIG Life of Canada, based in Toronto, sells insurance and retirement savings products, including universal and term life plans, critical illness plans and annuities. The company sells its services through more than 5,000 agents across Canada. 'Acquiring AIG Life of Canada will strengthen [Bank of Montreal's] overall financial planning, wealth and retirement offering, giving us the ability to expand our client relationships through a comprehensive line up of products,' Bill Downe, chief executive of Toronto-based BMO Financial Group said in a statement.  BMO Financial said it will take on AIG Life of Canada's 300 employees.  In November, the U.S. government gave AIG a $150 billion rescue package to help the company pull through the credit crisis. That package replaced an earlier loan of $85 billion after it became apparent the insurer needed more funds.  AIG said in October it would sell off a number of business units to repay the original $85 billion government loan.  The company has not specifically disclosed the assets it would sell or the expected prices from the sales. However, AIG has said it plans to retain its U.S. property and casualty and foreign general insurance businesses, and plans to retain an ownership interest in its foreign life insurance operations.  As of Dec. 22, AIG had already sold interests in four businesses, and earlier in the month was said to be in the final stages of selling its U.S. personal lines business.  Shares of AIG rose 4 cents to close at $1.58 Tuesday, while BMO Financial rose 28 cents to $27.23.
