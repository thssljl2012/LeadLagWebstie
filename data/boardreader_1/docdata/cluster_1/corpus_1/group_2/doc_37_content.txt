SINGAPORE: For the second straight day hundreds of anxious policyholders lined up in the hot sun outside Singapore offices of global insurance giant American International Group (AIG) Thursday. Hundreds more -- some vowing to terminate their policies -- were already inside the offices of AIG and its wholly-owned subsidiary, American International Assurance Company Limited (AIA), after lining up on Wednesday without getting served before closing time. They were apparently unmoved by an announcement from the US Federal Reserve, the central bank, that the United States government would give an unprecedented loan of up to 85 billion dollars to AIG in a bid to avert a global financial calamity. Taipei on Wednesday, more than 1,200 customers descended on a downtown office of AIG subsidiary Nan Shan Life Insurance, while in Hong Kong about two dozen anxious customers crowded into a small AIG subsidiary office. Authorities and AIA subsidiaries around the region sought to assure customers that the local firms are not in danger.
