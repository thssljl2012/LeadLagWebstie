 By James Quinn, Wall Street CorrespondentConcern over the health of US savings bank Washington Mutual heightened after ratings agency Standard &amp;amp; Poor's downgraded its credit rating to junk status. Shares in WaMu, which had already dropped 95pc year-to-date, fell by as much as 25pc, later recovering to trade up 20 cents at $2.20. WaMu, which is one of the largest players in the US mortgage market, will find it increasingly difficult to raise extra funds should it need to, in addition to the $7bn it raised back in April. Last week, the bank said it had sufficient capital to see it through, but S&amp;amp;P still chose to downgrade the bank's debt from BBB- to BB-, with a negative outlook. S&amp;amp;P said that the cut related to the 'increasing market turmoil' and the 'related impact from managing a concentrated mortgage franchise in [the] troubled housing credit cycle'. WaMu responded by saying its capital remained above levels that would normally be viewed as 'well capitalised', and the bank stressed that it has no exposure to insurance giant AIG and de minimis exposure to Lehman Brothers.
