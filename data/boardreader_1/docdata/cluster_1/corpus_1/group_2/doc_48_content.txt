We have sought to make it much clearerwho is operating in each country and under what name(s). Perhaps equally importantly, our profilesmake it plain which multinational companies are not operating in each country.In Latin America, we profile 21 companies. These are AEGON, AGF, AIG, Allianz, AXA, Cardif,CNP, Generali, HDI-Talanx, HSBC Insurance, ING, Liberty Mutual, MAPFRE, MetLife, NewYork Life, Prudential Financial, QBE, RSA, the Hartford, Principal Financial and Zurich.We also look at various local firms that are active. In general, they are small-to-medium sized operationsby world standards. However, several of the leading Brazilian insurers would rank as extremely largeeven in a major market.For almost all the countries whose reports we are updating, we are also able to include actual data forcalendar 2007: this was not the case for our Q208 reports.In 2007, total premiums in Argentina rose by 25% to ARS18,617mn. Non-life premiums rose by 25% toARS12,926mn, while Life premiums rose by 25% to ARS5,691mn.Between now and the end of the forecast period, we expect that annual Non-life premiums will grow byARS12,595mn, while annual Life premiums should increase by ARS2,278mn. Growth in Non-lifepremiums should be driven by the general growth in nominal GDP plus a rise in Non-life penetrationfrom the current level of 1.77% to 2.00%. Growth in Life premiums should be driven by the change in theoverall population and a rise in life density from US$46.33 to US$60.00 per capita.BMIs Insurance Business Environment Rating is 51.4.
