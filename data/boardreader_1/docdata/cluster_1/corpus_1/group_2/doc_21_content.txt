As the U.S. government loans $85 billion to American International Group Inc., the head of South Dakota's division of insurance is reassuring people about the company's subsidiaries.  Merle Scheiber, insurance division director, said none of the 42 AIG insurance companies licensed in South Dakota are facing any "imminent financial problems."AIG's problems stem from its holding company and not the licensed insurance companies doing business in this state, Scheiber said."It's my expectation that the various AIG companies will continue to provide insurance to South Dakotans and pay claims as normal," Scheiber said in a statement Wednesday. "The most likely change for policyholders as a result of this crisis is that their insurance company will be sold and their policies transferred to the new company."Scheiber said state insurance regulators are in place to ensure that policyholders of the insurance subsidiaries remain protected and will continue to do so even as AIG operates under the credit facility offered by the Federal Reserve. Insurance policyholders are not facing any imminent danger in retaining their policies although they may see some changes in the future, he said.People with questions can contact the South Dakota Division of Insurance at 773-3563 or insurance@state.sd.us.
