A Texas court this week approved a liquidation plan for National Prearranged Services Inc. of Clayton and two affiliated insurance companies.NPS sold as many as 200,000 prepaid funeral plans to consumers nationwide, including thousands in Missouri and Illinois. The insurance companies, Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance Co. and Memorial Service Life Insurance Co., issued insurance policies used to fund the plans.The liquidation plan was developed under auspices of the Texas Department of Insurance and Texas banking regulators because the insurance companies were based in Texas.Insurance regulators in Texas and Missouri ordered NPS to stop selling burial plans early this spring because of concerns that there wasn't enough money to pay claims. The companies agreed to be placed in receivership in May, but the receiver determined that the companies could not be rehabilitated and recommended liquidation.Under the plan, funeral homes will be paid for services they provide to NPS customers after submitting claims to Donna Garrett, a special deputy receiver appointed by Texas authorities. The payments are limited to the original insurance policy death benefit.Claims payments are temporarily on hold until the liquidation plan takes effect, which would be late next month. Texas regulators said claim checks could be sent from participating state guaranty associations as soon as early November.Douglas Cassity, formerly of Springfield, Mo., founded NPS in 1979. A family trust that controls the companies is owned by his wife, Rhonda, and two sons, Brent, of Clayton, and Tyler.Texas regulators recommend that consumers who were paying premiums for policies issued by Lincoln Memorial continue to pay those premiums as they come due, as well as any past-due premiums, until the liquidation plan becomes final. State guaranty associations will not pay benefits if a consumer hasn't paid the premiums.
