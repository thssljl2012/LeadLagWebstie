'AIG made an exhaustive effort to address its liquidity needs through private-sector financing but was unable to do so in the current environment,' Chairman and Chief Executive Edward M. Liddy said in a statement late on Tuesday. 'This facility was the company's best alternative.' AIG said interest on the credit line will be based on the three-month London interbank offered rate plus 8.5%. The company will pay a commitment fee on the credit line of 2% of the facility on the closing date, AIG said. And AIG will pay a commitment fee of 8.5% a year on the amounts it does not draw down. The interest and fees will be payable by increasing the balance outstanding, AIG said. AIG said it is required to repay the facility from, among other things, funds from asset sales and from issuance of debt or equity. AIG is 'already developing a plan to sell assets, repay the facility and emerge as a smaller but profitable company,' Liddy said. 'Importantly, AIG's insurance subsidiaries remain strong, liquid and well-capitalized.'
