 AIG Life Australia is continuing to provide financial advisers with new and improved insurance products and is hiring more staff, according to the Investor Daily. The expansion takes place despite a further US government bailout of its parent AIG.  AIG Life Australia's General Manager of Strategy and Marketing, Ken Morgan, said: 'We're hiring people to meet demand in response to our increased growth.'AIG Life Australia has continued to launch or boost its products, such as adding an accidental death benefit and a partial and permanent disablement benefit to one protection product.  The firm's A$10 million (US$6.37 million) programme to upgrade its technology systems over three years is also underway and will be piloted in the marketplace over the next month or two.  Meanwhile, AIG's Asian life insurance operations - American International Assurance (AIA), which includes AIG Life Australia  have been restructured from the AIG parent. 'It means in effect, AIA is operating as a separate organisation and that provides the organisation with more certainty and provides the Australian operations with more comfort,' said Mr Morgan. The US government's total bailout of AIG now stands at US$180 billion.  Ins Communications Pte Ltd
