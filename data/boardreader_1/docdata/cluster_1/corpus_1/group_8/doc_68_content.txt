('AIG's Philippine Insurance Ops To Be Folded Into Asian Unit', published at 1047 GMT Wednesday, wrongly described Philamlife as the country's largest nonlife insurer. The correct version follows.)   MANILA -(Dow Jones)-  (AIG) has decided to shelve plans to sell its insurance unit in the Philippines, and will instead fold it into American International Assurance Co. Ltd., or AIA, which holds AIG's Asian subsidiaries.  AIA said in a statement that The Philippine American Life and General Insurance Co., or Philamlife, has been taken off the auction block and 'will be retained and made part of the AIA group.' The company said that it was the appropriate time to include Philamlife, the Philippines' largest life insurance firm, in the new AIA structure as the rest of AIA is being separated from AIG and positioned as an independent operation. 'The Philippines is a very important part of the AIA Asian landscape. We are confident that there will be benefits for Philamlife's customers, employees and agents from being fully integrated into Asia's leading insurance company,' said AIA President   Mark Wilson. 'This will improve the structure and business of Philamlife.' Philamlife President and Chief Executive   Jose Cuisia  , a former central bank governor, said the inclusion of Philamlife into AIA is still subject to regulatory approval. He, however, expect the move to provide Philamlife 'with access to resources and Asia-wide network of the region's market leader.' Local newspapers reported Philamlife's sale was put on hold it received dismal offers from potential bidders last week.  -By   Cris Larano  , Dow Jones Newswires; 632-848-5051; cris.larano@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 03-04-092256ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
