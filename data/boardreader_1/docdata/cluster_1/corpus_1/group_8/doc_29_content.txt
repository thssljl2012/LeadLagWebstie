Jonathan Ratner, Financial Post  Manulife Financial Corp. has denied recent speculation that it might raise money by issuing common shares, but admitted it would consider doing so if it were pursuing a strategic transaction. 'Given our financial strength, we may be one of the few global companies able to do a large strategic acquisition in these opportunistic markets. We continue to be very disciplined in our approach,' Manulife chief executive Dominic D'Alessandro said. 'Any transaction must be beneficial to our shareholders and must maintain our capital position for the benefit of our policyholders.' The insurer recently filed a shelf prospectus with U. S. and Canadian regulators that puts it in a position to raise cash quickly. It is also reportedly in the running to acquire AIG's life insurance units in the Philippines and Japan. 'Although equity markets have declined since the beginning of the year, Manulife continues to be well capitalized and is able to withstand additional equity volatility,' the company said. Scotia Capital analyst Tom MacKinnon told clients last week that an equity recapitalization is unlikely, but said Manulife could do a debt/preferred financing for as much as $1-billion. He also also suggested that the domestic shelf of up to $10-billion and $1-billion or more in the United States could leave $3-billion for possible acquisitions.
