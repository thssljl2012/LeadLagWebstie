* AIG in talks with PKO, other parties to sell Polish bank  * PZU interested in AIG's insurance business in CEE  (Recasts, adds PZU comments)  WARSAW, Dec 10 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N: Quote, Profile, Research) moved a step closer to selling its east European operations as Poland's state-controlled bank PKO BP PKOB.WA and insurer PZU each lined up as potential buyers of parts of the business.  AIG, which is seeking to raise cash via asset sales after staving off bankruptcy thanks to a U.S. government bailout that ballooned to $152 billion, is in non-exclusive talks over its Polish consumer banking arm with PKO, the bank said late on Tuesday.  Analysts estimate the value of the business at between $0.5-$1.0 billion. Some caution, however, that the potential acquisition could bring more risks than benefits for a buyer such as PKO, which is seeking to wrest back top spot among Poland's banks from UniCredit's (CRDI.MI: Quote, Profile, Research) Pekao BAPE.WA.  AIG said on Wednesday it is also talking about the business to other parties, which Polish newspapers speculated could include ING (ING.AS: Quote, Profile, Research) and HSBC (HSBA.L: Quote, Profile, Research).  Also on Wednesday, the head of central and eastern Europe's largest insurer, PZU, said he was interested in grabbing AIG's insurance business in the region as part of an expansion drive.
