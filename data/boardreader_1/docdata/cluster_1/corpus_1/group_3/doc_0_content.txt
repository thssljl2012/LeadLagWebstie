DOW JONES NEWSWIRESAmerican International Group Inc. (AIG) appointed the giant insurer's comptroller, David L. Herzog, as chief financial officer. Herzog, 48 years old, will report to Chief Executive Edward Liddy, who replaced Martin Sullivan when AIG accepted a $85 billion credit facility from the federal government last month. Herzog replaces Steven J. Bensinger, the former financial chief who became vice chairman of financial services in May. Bensinger left AIG to pursue other opportunities, according to a statement from the company Thursday. Herzog will have a central role in overseeing AIG's plan to improve its capital structure and pay down the loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He also will work closely with AIG Chief Administrative Officer Richard Booth to review expenses and practices, the company said. Earlier Thursday, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and AIG said they will work together to recover millions of dollars of improper expenditures, including compensation paid to two former executives. The company also has agreed not to make payments pursuant to Bensinger's multimillion-dollar employment agreement and to immediately cancel all junkets or perks that aren't strictly justified by legitimate business needs. A federal criminal probe under way since earlier this year is looking at how candid company executives were with investors at a December investor conference and whether executives at AIG's financial-products unit, which sold derivatives contracts, misled AIG's outside auditor last fall. Herzog had been comptroller since June 2005. He joined American General Corp. in February 2000 and was named chief operating officer for the combined U.S. life insurance companies after AIG's acquisition of American General in 2001. He was named AIG vice president, life insurance in 2003 and financial chief of AIG's worldwide life insurance operations a year later. AIG's shares were at $2.42, down 0.4%, in after-hours trading. -By Kathy Shwiff, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5975; Kathy.Shwiff@dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=3N1Yh%2B763c8JAxskzsObjw%3D%3D.
