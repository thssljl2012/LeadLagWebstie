DUBLIN, Ireland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/09c749/brazil_insurance_r) has announced the addition of the 'Brazil Insurance Report Q3 2008' report to their offering.  In Q308, the key change is that we have incorporated much more information about the companies that are operating across the regions of which each country is a part. We have sought to make it much clearer who is operating in each country and under what name(s). Perhaps equally importantly, our profiles make it plain which multinational companies are not operating in each country.In Latin America, we profile 21 companies. These are AEGON, AGF, AIG, Allianz, AXA, Cardif, CNP, Generali, HDI-Talanx, HSBC Insurance, ING, Liberty Mutual, MAPFRE, MetLife, New York Life, Prudential Financial, QBE, RSA, the Hartford, Principal Financial and Zurich. We also look at various local firms that are active. In general, they are small-to-medium sized operations by world standards. However, several of the leading Brazilian insurers would rank as extremely large even in a major market.For almost all the countries whose reports we are updating, we are also able to include actual data for calendar 2007: this was not the case for our Q208 reports.In 2007, total premiums in Brazil rose by 16% to BRL141,748mn. Non-life premiums rose by 15% to BRL105,784mn, while Life premiums rose by 21% to BRL35,964mn.Between now and the end of the forecast period, we expect that annual Non-life premiums will grow by BRL 48,138 million, while annual Life premiums should increase by BRL10,336 million. Growth in Non-life premiums should be driven by the general growth in nominal GDP. However, there should be slight slippage in Non-life penetration from the current level of 4.20% to 4.00%. Growth in Life premiums should be driven by the change in the overall population and a rise in life density from US$94.47 to US$130.00 per capita.Brazils Insurance Business Environment Rating is 66.9.Key Topics Covered:The Sector At A Glance 5Table: Overview Of Brazils Insurance Sector 5Key Insights On Brazils Insurance Sector 5Brazil Industry SWOT 7Development Of BMIs Insurance Reports 8Projections And Forecasts 10Table: Premiums  Historical Data And Forecasts, 2005-2012 10Projections And Drivers Of Growth 10Table: Growth Drivers 11Country Update 12Macroeconomic Outlook 12Table: Brazil  Economic Activity 13Political Outlook 14Table: Brazil  Insurance Business Environment Indicators 17Table: Latin America Insurance Business Environment Rankings 18Regional Context .19Table: Non-Life Premiums In A Regional Context, 2007 . 19Table: Life Premiums In A Regional Context, 2007 20Table: Comparison Of Major Lines As % Of Non-Life Premiums, 2006 20Analysis Of Competitive Conditions 21Brazil  Non-Life Segment 24Brazil  Life Segment 24Methodology .66Basis Of Projections 66Insurance Business Environment Rating 67Table: Insurance Business Environment Indicators And Rationale 68Table: Weighting Of Indicators 69Companies Mentioned:- AEGON- AGF- AIG- Allianz- AXA- Cardif- CNP- Generali- HDI-Gerling- HSBC Insurance- ING- Liberty Mutual- MAPFRE- MetLife- New York Life .- Prudential Financial- QBE- RSA- The Hartford- The Principal- ZurichFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/09c749/brazil_insurance_r
