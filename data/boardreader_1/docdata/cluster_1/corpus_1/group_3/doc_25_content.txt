To address companies' concerns about litigation, W.R. Berkley Corp. of Greenwich has formed a new division called Berkley Professional Liability, or BerkleyPro. BerkleyPro will offer professional liability products, including directors and officers liability (D&amp;amp;O) insurance. The New York City-based unit will focus on large publicly traded and privately held companies. Three AIG insurance veterans will lead the new operating unit, W.R. Berkley spokeswoman Karen Horvath said. 'We found some true specialists in the D&amp;amp;O area,' Horvath said. 'They have the expertise and experience that is necessary to start a professional unit. To us, people are the most important element of a new operation.' Berkley named John Benedetto as president of BerkleyPro. He has more than 19 years of experience in the insurance and financial services industries and held senior positions with AIG. Steven Walsh, with 14 years of related experience in the insurance industry, has been appointed executive vice president. Paul Brophy has been named BerkleyPro's senior vice president. He has more than 15 years of insurance experience in both underwriting and management. 'The formation of BerkleyPro demonstrates our commitment to selectively identifying new opportunities that offer superior risk-adjusted returns,' William Berkley, chairman and chief executive officer of W.R. Berkley, said in a statement. 'We expect that BerkleyPro's operations will complement the other professional liability Advertisementproducts presently offered by the W. R. Berkley Corp. group of companies.' D&amp;amp;O insurance offers potential growth, according to a Chubb Private Company Risk Survey. The survey said 37 percent of U.S. companies do not purchase any type of management liability-professional liability insurance. The study also revealed that 62 percent of U.S. private companies have experienced some type of event related to management-professional liability in the past five years, including workplace crime, employment practices liability and directors and officers liability. 'We are, by nature, a litigious society, so businesses are becoming more aware of the potential risks that they face,' said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the New York City-based Insurance Information Institute. 'More and more midsize companies, and even smaller companies, are having an interest in this type of coverage.' Founded in 1967, W.R. Berkley is an insurance holding company that operates in five segments of the property casualty insurance business: specialty insurance, regional property casualty insurance, alternative markets, reinsurance and international. - Staff Writer Peter Healy can be reached at peter.healy@scni.com or at 203 964-2276.
