 Inter Milan have not given up hope of signing Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard this summer, according to the Serie A club's chief executive.The England international has been strongly linked with a move to the Nerazzurri, where he would be reunited with former Blues boss Jose Mourinho.Although Chelsea are reportedly reluctant to sell the 30-year-old and Lampard is seemingly yet to decide where his future lies, Inter are happy to play the waiting game as he enters the final year of his contract. 'We will see how things evolve in the next coming days,' said Inter chief executive Ernesto Paolillo. 'But that is not to say that the negotiations are over. 'Anyway, we have made sure we have a competitive team even without Lampard.' Meanwhile Inter are on the verge of signing attacking midfielder Sulley Muntari from Portsmouth.The 23-year-old, who played at Udinese before moving to the Barclays Premier League, is expected to complete the transfer on Saturday.
