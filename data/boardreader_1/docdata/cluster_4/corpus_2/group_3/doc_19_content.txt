 The Premier League official site :   Quote:   Portsmouth are almost certain to be without midfielders   Lassana Diarra   and   Richard Hughes   for Saturday&amp;#039;s Barclays Premier League trip to Aston Villa. Diarra has been troubled by a knee injury and Hughes has a groin problem, while   Niko Kranjcar   (ankle) is still at least two weeks away from a return.    Papa Bouba Diop   will switch from the right to his preferred central midfield role, leaving fit-again   John Utaka   and   Glen Little   to contest the wide position.   Younes Kaboul  , who injured his back playing for France Under-21s in midweek is also likely to be unavailable but   Sean Davis   is expected to feature despite suffering back-spasms during training.
