Yes, because it was a small, completely isolated incident...         Good samaritan beaten to death by mob    From correspondents in London   October 01, 2008     www.news.com.au       A man was beaten to death by a mob today after stepping in to save a couple being assaulted at a taxi rank in London.      Frank McGarahan, 45, was out with relatives on the eve of his niece&amp;#039;s christening when he saw the pair being attacked.      As the father-of-two shouted at the gang of 10 men to stop, they turned on him, inflicting a fatal head injury.      Mr McGarahan was chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, the bespoke finance arm of Barclays Bank which caters for their richest customers.      The family went out for dinner on Saturday evening in Norwich, southeast England, after which Mr McGarahan&amp;#039;s wife Alison and their children, aged seven and four months, returned to their hotel.      Mr McGarahan stayed out for another drink with two male relatives.      They were waiting for a taxi when the attack happened.      &amp;amp;quot;Frank was in a taxi queue with one of his younger brothers and another relative,&amp;amp;quot; a family member said yesterday.      &amp;amp;quot;They were at the back of a queue waiting quietly to go back to their hotel when they saw an assault taking place on a young man and his girlfriend by a mob of nine or 10 blokes in their early 20s.      &amp;amp;quot;Some other people in the queue were telling these guys to stop and Frank and one of his relatives did the same.      &amp;amp;quot;Out of the blue, both got attacked. Frank suffered serious head injuries.      &amp;amp;quot;Frank was a fair-minded person. He wouldn&amp;#039;t see anyone treated unfairly. He just believed in a quiet life. He was just being a good citizen.      &amp;amp;quot;He believed in everyone getting on with their day-to-day business. He believed in fairness and decency.&amp;amp;quot;      The family spokesman described him as &amp;amp;quot;fantastic family man&amp;amp;quot;.      Police arrested three men later.      &amp;amp;quot;Three local males in their early 20s are currently in custody,&amp;amp;quot; a spokesman for Norfolk police said.      &amp;amp;quot;They will be interviewed this evening and tomorrow.&amp;amp;quot;      - With Reuters
