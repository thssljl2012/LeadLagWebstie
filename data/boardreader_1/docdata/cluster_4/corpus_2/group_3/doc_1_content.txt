 I think it is obvious this Banker  was Murdered for the obvious reason..    LIVID INVESTORS     I think CEO&amp;#039;s of all company&amp;#039;s that plan on screwing shareholders    through  lies, deceit and fraud should be very careful going forward    Justice may be served outside the courts      Another deal like the Aurilian  Kinross deal and the people involved may wind up with the same fate...            Dear CIGAs,            Who paid the three?   Was the homeless man really homeless? What has the performance of Barclay&amp;#039;s Wealth Fund been?          A banker robs his employers at the Bank Espirito Sancto of the Vatican and he ends up hanging himself under the London Bridge.        Money people who kill others with abandon and without any regret are not isolated from instant Karma.            Investors are livid  . I am livid.  All those including the man in the street are livid beyond imagination at those that use criminality for profit everywhere.           I am thinking of inviting a few people to a special meeting in Toronto in February so I can introduce them to you. That is if they are still available.             Arrests Over Top Banker&amp;#039;s Murder     7:01pm UK, Tuesday September 30, 2008             Three people have been arrested over the murder of a top banker who was beaten to death while trying to save a homeless man. Frank McGarahan, 45, chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, was set upon by a group of men in Norwich at 3am on Sunday.          The father of two, from Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, had been queuing for a taxi with relatives at the time.            Detectives said three men - all in their early twenties and from the Norwich area - had been arrested. They are being held at police stations across Norfolk.            Sky&amp;#039;s Angela Corpe, at the scene of the attack in Norwich, added: &amp;quot;Police say they desperately do not want people to think this case is now closed, and anyone with any further information should come forward.&amp;quot; Mr McGarahan stepped in when he spotted a gang attacking the homeless Lithuanian man, who was walking a dog with his girlfriend.            Detective Superintendent Chris Hobley, heading the inquiry, said there was an &amp;quot;exchange of words&amp;quot; then Mr McGarahan was hurt.           More...
