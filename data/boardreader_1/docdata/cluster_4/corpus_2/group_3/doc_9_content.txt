         West Ham v Bolton: Preview      West Ham look set to retain the team which defeated Fulham for Sunday&amp;#039;s Barclays Premier League clash with Bolton. Defenders James Tomkins and James Collins have been out with knee injuries but are close to full fitness and are expected to return next weekend.  Striker Dean Ashton is sidelined after undergoing ankle surgery with no date set for his comeback.  West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola insists he appreciates Bolton&amp;#039;s physical style as Upton Park prepares for a clash of cultures.  The Hammers are seeking a third straight Barclays Premier League victory under Zola, while Bolton will attempt to muscle their way to a first win in the capital in 16 games.  Zola is keen to honour West Ham&amp;#039;s tradition of playing passing football but the former Italy striker understands why the Trotters observe their own philosophy.  &amp;amp;quot;Bolton are certainly a straightforward team. They are very direct and are a side we must respect,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.  &amp;amp;quot;Football is good because there are different ways to see it and play. I don&amp;#039;t mind Bolton. They have got their own way, I&amp;#039;ve got mine.  &amp;amp;quot;Maybe they don&amp;#039;t like the way we play but I respect them and so far they have done well.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Zola added: &amp;amp;quot;In their last game they lost 2-0 to Manchester United but they were unlucky as they played very well.  &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s going to be very tough because they&amp;#039;ll put bodies behind the ball and are also a threat from set-pieces.  &amp;amp;quot;We will need to perform very well if we want to beat them.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Bolton manager Gary Megson has a full-strength squad available.  Matthew Taylor is fully fit after recovering from a broken toe and is pushing for a starting berth on the left side of midfield.  He could replace Ricardo Gardner, with the Jamaican possibly dropping back to left-back at the expense of Jlloyd Samuel.  Bolton defender Jlloyd Samuel fears verbal abuse from supporters will continue for the foreseeable future after Sol Campbell was targeted by Tottenham fans last weekend.  Portsmouth have confirmed they will make an official complaint to the Football Association over the abuse Campbell received during last Sunday&amp;#039;s match against his former club.  The Pompey captain was subjected to a series of sickening chants from the away section during his team&amp;#039;s 2-0 Barclays Premier League victory at Fratton Park.  Hampshire police confirmed on Wednesday they would investigate alleged racist and homophobic insults aimed at the player.  However, Samuel - who was himself on the receiving end of abuse earlier in his career - said: &amp;amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t think it will ever end.  &amp;amp;quot;You are always going to get that minority of people who want to keep going.  &amp;amp;quot;You try and block it out and continue with your game but I&amp;#039;ve experienced it myself at international level when I&amp;#039;ve played abroad.  &amp;amp;quot;You hear it in the crowd and you get used to hearing it, but you shouldn&amp;#039;t have to.  &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;#039;ve definitely got sympathy with Sol. You want to kick out all this abusive language because we don&amp;#039;t want it in our game.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      ESPNsoccernet
