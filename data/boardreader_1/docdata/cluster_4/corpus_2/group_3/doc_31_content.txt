     Quote:                         Ramos was forced to defend himself after Russia complained about Roman Pavlyuchenko being brought on in the 2-1 Barclays Premier League defeat away to Stoke City on Sunday, even though the forward had had only one day&amp;amp;#8217;s training and had missed the international matches because of an ankle injury.  &amp;amp;#8220;He is not in the best condition,&amp;amp;#8221; Ramos said. &amp;amp;#8220;Yes, he still has a problem.&amp;amp;#8221;                        http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/spo...cle4996503.ece     He is really losing the plot...we had campbell in the team the other day.
