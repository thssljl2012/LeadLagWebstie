  Manager of the Month - Phil Brown (Hull City) Player of the Month - Ashley Young (Aston Villa)  I can quite say that&amp;#039;s fair. Phil Brown led Hull to 3rd in the Premier League and defeated a top 4 club. So he&amp;#039;s obviously going to get attention.  Ashley Young deserved it as he was on top-form all year. He also scored twice and made two assists. So fair play to him.
