         O&amp;#039;Neill delighted at Villa&amp;#039;s UEFA Cup success      Martin O&amp;#039;Neill is satisfied Aston Villa have taken a step in the right direction, after clinching a place in the group stages of the UEFA Cup.   Villa were held to a 1-1 home draw by Litex Lovech on Thursday night but came through the first-round encounter 4-2 on aggregate, having effectively sealed the tie in Bulgaria a fortnight ago.  Marlon Harewood scored his first goal of the campaign for a Villa side showing six changes, as several of their big-name players were rested for Sunday&amp;#039;s Barclays Premier League match at Chelsea.  Villa are guaranteed four more European ties in their first campaign in the competition for seven years, since the John Gregory era.  O&amp;#039;Neill said: &amp;amp;quot;I am just really pleased we are through.  &amp;amp;quot;We are in the draw on Tuesday, and I am really delighted. We have got some European evenings at Villa Park, which I am really looking forward to.  &amp;amp;quot;I can&amp;#039;t say I&amp;#039;ve talked to loads and loads of fans - but it is something they are definitely looking forward to.&amp;amp;quot;  Villa&amp;#039;s reward came via an often dour second leg.  &amp;amp;quot;It was hard to get excited by it,&amp;amp;quot; O&amp;#039;Neill admitted.  &amp;amp;quot;We were leading in the tie 3-1, a wee bit reminiscent of the previous round.  &amp;amp;quot;I was amazed at the crowd that turned up (27,000) - because in essence, the tie was in a good position for us.  &amp;amp;quot;Does it show Aston Villa are back? If I stop to think about it, that is right.  &amp;amp;quot;Everyone has to fight for it, but it is a step in the right direction for the football club.  &amp;amp;quot;We are into the proper stages, the group stages. The advantages by a million miles outweigh any disadvantage you have. We have got a chance now for younger players to experience this.  &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;ve earned it. I would have taken this way back in July - and now it is up to us to do what we can.&amp;amp;quot;  O&amp;#039;Neill is hoping the likes of Gareth Barry, Nigel Reo-Coker, Gabriel Agbonlahor, Martin Laursen, John Carew and Curtis Davies will be fresh for the trip to Stamford Bridge after being rested.  He said: &amp;amp;quot;That was the idea of leaving them out. Sometimes you never know what might happen. But Gareth Barry was crying out for a break.  &amp;amp;quot;He has played a lot of games, including internationals with England, and that will help him enormously.  &amp;amp;quot;In normal circumstances I would also have looked to rest Stiliyan Petrov but I just wanted him to sit there in front of the back four and make sure we got through the tie.&amp;amp;quot;       ESPNsoccernet
