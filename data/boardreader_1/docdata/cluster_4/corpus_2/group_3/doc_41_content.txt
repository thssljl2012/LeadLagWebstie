 Further confidence problems in the Arsenal dressing room?   quote  BBC Sport    Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor has questioned his side&amp;#039;s ability to win the Premier League, unless they start to develop a winning mentality.   The Gunners appeared to be heading for victory over arch-rivals Tottenham on Wednesday, but conceded two late goals to draw the game 4-4.   The 24-year-old suggested his team-mates thought the game was won and was at a loss to describe what went wrong.   &amp;quot;To be champions in this way? You can never be a champion,&amp;quot; Adebayor said.   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was furious at his side&amp;#039;s capitulation at the Emirates Stadium and Adebayor echoed his manager&amp;#039;s sentiments.   The Togo international added: &amp;quot;There is a lot of disappointment. We are down at the moment because we did everything to get the three points and we ended up with one.   &amp;quot;We feel very sorry for ourselves that the things are not going the right way.   &amp;quot;It was one of the most difficult games in my life because I cannot understand that after 90 minutes we were leading 4-2 - I don&amp;#039;t know how we finished with a draw.
