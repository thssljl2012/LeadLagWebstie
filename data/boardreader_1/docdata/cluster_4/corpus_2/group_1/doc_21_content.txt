I have just got my renewal from MY insurance company (AIG)and they have put the 6 months up by 97 dollars because I had a &amp;#039;no fault accident on my part, but they say now, I am a risk ?.   Hang on a minute I was sat doing what I was supposed to be doing and stationary and my insurance goes up and it stays on MY record for three years   They say it happens all the time and there is nothing I can do about it.   My question &amp;#039;Is there&amp;#039; anything I can do like, an onsbudsman or do I take against the other parties insurance for my rate going up or is it as I suspect &amp;#039;An American thing&amp;#039;.Sorry for the rant but it seems I am experiencing one of those qaint American quirks ! Any advice people ?. Ta                        I got rearended last fall at a stop sign and my ins. co said that if I wasn&amp;#039;t claiming against them for repairs, but rather through the guy that hit me&amp;#039;s insurance, then it wasn&amp;#039;t an issue and no change to rates.
