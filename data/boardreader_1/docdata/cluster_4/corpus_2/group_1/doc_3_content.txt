I remember getting in a fix about 20 years ago - I went straight into the bank and met a lovely old chap called George. He went through my statement on his computer and just cancelled all the charges. He also discovered that my &amp;amp;quot;fix&amp;amp;quot; had affected my credit status. With a click of his mouse he changed my credit rating from high to low risk and all was well.      Now, I can&amp;#039;t make an appointment within a fortnight and every time I go to the bank I meet somebody different. Everybody there has a &amp;amp;quot;computer sez no&amp;amp;quot; attitude and the charges they apply for &amp;amp;quot;unplanned overdrafts&amp;amp;quot; are punitive to put it mildly. You can&amp;#039;t speak to your own branch directly by telephone and, again, you never speak to the same person twice on the &amp;#039;phone.     All that and they charge me 17 per month for the privilege of having an account for them to plunder. I&amp;#039;m out of there as soon as I can manage it and wouldn&amp;#039;t recommend Lloyds if it was the last bank on earth.                         Well if you keep to the terms and conditions then you should have no problem.  I have been with Lloyds for over 25 years and in my experience they are the best.  Whenever I have needed a loan, overdraft, credit card or savings account there has never been a problem.       Also I have never felt the need to visit a George in branch because I know the terms and conditions and never breach them.
