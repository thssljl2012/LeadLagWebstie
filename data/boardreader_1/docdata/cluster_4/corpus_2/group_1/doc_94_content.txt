I just called 800.317.9758 for status check. They approved for &amp;amp;#036;11,500. They pulled EX :720     Very Nice&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;  Congrats&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33; I think that this will be a great card&amp;amp;#33;      Congrat for your &amp;amp;#036;25K too, great CL&amp;amp;#33; Definitely I will never understand the UW logic; despite your 760  Discover declined you while they approved me for &amp;amp;#036;8K with a weaker score. WorldPwerk gave you &amp;amp;#036;10K while they gave me &amp;amp;#036;15K      I completely agree. I think that alot of it has to do with who answers the phone when you call. The witch at Dickscover wasn&amp;#039;t trying to hear anything I had to say. If I had someone like the nice lady at SFB, I would have a Dickscover Card on the way with a &amp;amp;#036;30k limit.
