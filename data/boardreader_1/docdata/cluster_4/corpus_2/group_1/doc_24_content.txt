Sorry - you shouldn&amp;#039;t expect him to acknowledge you, if for no other reason than that if he acknowledges you he opens the door to everyone trying to get his attention.      I said &amp;amp;quot;that may be true&amp;amp;quot; because I&amp;#039;ve heard Bubba&amp;#039;s also a jerk to a lot of other people even when he has no reason to be (like volunteers on pro-am day)... but yeah, not so much for what he &amp;amp;quot;did&amp;amp;quot; to you.      You may not like him anymore, and I&amp;#039;m not trying to change your mind on that, just know that some guys really like to be into themselves in a round. Some guys can be a bit more jovial. Whatever suits them.            Because he&amp;#039;s petulant.   Because he beats our asses in the Ryder Cup.   The list goes on from there.                      I understand Bubba&amp;#039;s reasons for not wanting to engage in an actual conversation. As a matter of fact, ever player that was yelled to by other people, just waved or nodded his head. That&amp;#039;s all I was looking for out of Bubba as he walked off the range - just some appreciation of his fans. I wasn&amp;#039;t looking for a converstaion or even words out of his mouth.      And people should not hate Sergio Garcia because he beats us in the Ryder Cup. I&amp;#039;m sorry out team hasn&amp;#039;t been that great the past few times out. It&amp;#039;s not his fault he plays good golf during it.
