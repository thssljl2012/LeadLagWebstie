      Sorry but I didn&amp;#039;t answer you question. There is a template for that business plan asks your friend the Agent for it. The business plan is important but mostly they want to see how well you take criticism after you submit it the first time. A lot of the things you won&amp;#039;t have a clue about and they know that. Things like internal marketing systems, actual compensation (not that template they show most people), start up costs etc .I would call a few agents that have been around less than 2 years and they will share their plans and give suggestions. Most people stress over this with them but the content is not any more important than how you present it to them.     A business plan is an important part of any successful business but they are not looking for a 50 page plan with charts and graphs just a clear concise plan that has the high numbers and action plans as how to get them. They will want to know how much you will spend and how much you need to sell to get there. Now you won&amp;#039;t make (earn) what they say you will, but they don&amp;#039;t know you know that so just plug in some high numbers and constantly talk about how important you KNOW it is for absolutely EVERYONE to have more life insurance and they will think you are just awesome. Have real life stories about how having or not having life insurance impacted people&amp;#039;s lives and you will be 3 steps ahead of your competition.
