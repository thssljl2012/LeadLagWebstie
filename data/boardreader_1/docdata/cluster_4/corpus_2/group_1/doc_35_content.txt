The only problems we can foresee are if Abbey and Barclays drag their feet as Newcastle have said if the current ISA managers have not transferred funds to them after 30 days then they will cancel the transfer request.                      Have today learnt that my previous ISAs were both received at Newcastle on Monday of this week.      Looks like both Abbey and Barclays have been very prompt in transferring, well within the 30 day limit.  I&amp;#039;m pleasantly surprised considering Shabby Abbey&amp;#039;s normal incompetent service and Barclays debacle over ISA openings the last couple of years.      BUT guess who gave them the wrong info for the Barclays ISA.  I meant to transfer last year&amp;#039;s Tax Beater but inadvertently gave the account number and sort code of this year&amp;#039;s Tax Haven instead    doh!  Oh well, will just transfer the first Barclays one as well.  Not losing that much in interest really by transferring this years.
