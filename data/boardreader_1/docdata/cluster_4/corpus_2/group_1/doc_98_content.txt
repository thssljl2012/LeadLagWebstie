 Dear dwhitt,     Glad you&amp;#039;re okay, I&amp;#039;m sure every one of us has had at least one moment where our car was out of control because we gave the car inputs it responded to without question....thankfully many of us didn&amp;#039;t have the car hit anything during that moment. If yours did, well thats just bad luck/karma/etc. and likely won&amp;#039;t happen again....that&amp;#039;s the best part....you&amp;#039;re a better driver for having experienced your sad event.....Go for an &amp;#039;09!!     I went to driving range tonight....7 out of 10 shots were crap.....I&amp;#039;m not giving up golf....I hope you don&amp;#039;t give up Viper ownership either!     Regards,  Aaron
