 The NY area has an abundance of sports complexes that can be used, although they&amp;#039;d be spread into the NJ area also.  -New Giants Stadium (track &amp;amp;amp; field/opening ceremony) -Madison Square Garden (basketball) -Barclays Center (gymnastics) -East River/Hudson River (rowing and sailing events) -They can probably built a temporary outdoor pool in Central Park for swimming events    ugh....just the thought of open water swimming events taking place in the hudson.....would you swim in that?
