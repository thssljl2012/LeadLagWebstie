  the Barclays reserve charges (to which I assume you are referring) have been introduced to create a &amp;#039;service&amp;#039; charge as opposed to a &amp;#039;default&amp;#039; charge.  At the moment it isn&amp;#039;t reclaimable although any 8 charges may still be, but i suspect any cap will be about that marker.  The OFT are currently looking at Barclays new fees and I would hope they will be bought up in the test case and the situation clarified.  For the moment though you must treat them as not reclaimable and I would advise if you possibly can OPTING OUT OF THE BARCLAYS PERSONAL RESERVE.
