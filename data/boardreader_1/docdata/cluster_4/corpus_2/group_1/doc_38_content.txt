 Sorry to hear about that unfortunate mishap.. there&amp;#039;s some great dealers here. Get back up the saddle and order a new one, I&amp;#039;d find it tough losing something like that over a mishap..     RavenFan.. that&amp;#039;s a tough one, glad it worked out for the better.. I accidently zinged a ball right at my brother inlaw one time as we was down the green a bit, luckily he ducked just in time behind his golf bag.. I have had bad luck playing with friends.. one time with another buddy, we were out skeet shooting, using one of those hand held clay pigeon pitching things (you gotta get used to snapping your wrist to release the clay disc), I swung and it released too late and came around, and it almost hit him in the side of the head hitting his ball cap.. but lucky for me it didn&amp;#039;t hit him, his Italian blood would have boiled instantly imagining that he would have had me dancing to semi auto shotgun fire like the western days..
