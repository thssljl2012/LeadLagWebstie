My remarks were not only directed toward this particular &amp;amp;quot;Thrasher&amp;amp;quot; but to many other Viper owners. These are beautiful cars that deserve our respect. Reckless driving for the sake of bamboozling one&amp;#039;s cronies is something that one should only do in a Mustang or late model corvette. Vipers deserve more. Here are some elementary tips;     1. Do not flog the gas peddle while the steering wheel is turned.  2. Never let a teenager drive your Viper or influence your driving.  3. Before you think impulsively, ask yourself, &amp;amp;quot;How would I feel if I destroy this car?&amp;amp;quot;  4. Consider joining a road course driving group such as Safe Motorsports if you desire to do some spirited driving. Don&amp;#039;t whine when Chuck laps you.  5. Do not drink and drive unless you are driving a Mustang in an empty parking lot.  6. When you pass by some 13 year old dipsh1ts in your neighborhood, do not react to their &amp;amp;quot;spin &amp;#039;em&amp;amp;quot; gestures and sub 80 IQ chants.  7. Do not attempt turns at over three times the speed limit when the road is lined with trees, guardrails or construction equipment.  8. If you need a vehicle to display your manhood in, buy a dirt bike, thrash the hell out of it and laugh all the way to the back brace in your closet.  9. Never drive a Viper without first unloading your male hormones. If your wife or girlfriend will not participate in such vital activities, learn to perfect some self survival skills ( you should have accomplished this by the age of 13 )  10. Remember that there is plenty of fun to have in your Viper, well below the threshold of thrashing the ever living sh1t out of it, into a telephone pole.
