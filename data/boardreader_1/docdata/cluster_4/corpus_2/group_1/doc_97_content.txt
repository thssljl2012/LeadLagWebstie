Good Luck !                           To be quite honest, I can&amp;#039;t be bothered. I&amp;#039;m heartily sick of dealing with banks and suchlike.      If they really don&amp;#039;t want me to use internet banking, then I shan&amp;#039;t. It&amp;#039;s a minor inconvenience, but worse things happen at sea.       I cannot currently use the Barclays internet banking anyhow, since they won&amp;#039;t let me use it any more until I apply for some stupid electronic card reader that I have to have in my house when I want to use it. This is a &amp;amp;quot;security improvement&amp;amp;quot; they implemented last month without telling anyone. Well, I don&amp;#039;t want one and won&amp;#039;t have one! It&amp;#039;s as simple as that.      So I&amp;#039;m basically in the same boat whichever way you look!
