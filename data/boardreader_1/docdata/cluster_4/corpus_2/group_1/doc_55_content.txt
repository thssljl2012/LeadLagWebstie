I&amp;amp;#039;m assuming you&amp;amp;#039;re leaving from the US since you mentioned USD...      I&amp;amp;#039;d visit www.ultimatechoicetravel.com/seetheworld and click &amp;amp;quot;book travel online&amp;amp;quot; I&amp;amp;#039;d also recommend getting a quote from the Concierge Desk since it just takes a second and will most likely be cheaper than what they can advertise on the site.      Use that same website but click &amp;amp;quot;concierge&amp;amp;quot; and fill out the travel request form-someone will contact you fairy quickly.       They are a Travelocity.com and AIG travel insurance partner company..   hope this helps!      Truthfully I&amp;amp;#039;d try to set aside maybe 7,000 just to be on the safe side..but that&amp;amp;#039;s just me..
