 then make your best educated decision on the things that you have heard from this site,i have read all the things the other guys have said and i agrree with alot of it however, out of curiosity why would you buy a salvage bike anyway!!! are you going to try to finance this thing if you are planning to do that then good luckk get a new one dude. it might cost you like 40 more a month but it would definetly be worth it and get aig insurance i only pay 50 a month for mine.
