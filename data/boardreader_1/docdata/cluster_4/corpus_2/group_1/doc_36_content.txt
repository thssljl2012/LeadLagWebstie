Nobody seems to know anything about this course.  I want to mix in a McCarron style long shot, but I can&amp;#039;t differentiate between the six guys I am considering so it probably won&amp;#039;t happen.    This just happened though.  Fuck:    Northeast Pennsylvania Classic    Brendon Todd Outright 55-1 (1/2)  Brendon Todd Top 5 11-1 (1/2)    Also looked at Tomasulo and Barnes
