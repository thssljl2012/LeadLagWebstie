             Re: &amp;amp;quot;EH SICK JACKET EH LAD...&amp;amp;quot; : THE NAUTICA SWAP MEET                       There was an armed hold up in Parramatta tonight.  Outside the Westpac Bank (cnr Church/George St)  One guy got shot, two others got away.     I nearly got taken out by a cop car rushing to the scene.     Hectic.                 __________________                     Originally Posted by  Concept        Boogs is the legend of all legends.
