If he plays well at the Barclays and the Deutsche Bank Championship, Azinger will have to think twice about not taking Mahan as a Captain&amp;#039;s pick - regardless of his perception of Mahan&amp;#039;s comments.  (Not to mention how ironic and/or hypocritical it would be for Azinger to exclude Mahan for being outspoken.)
