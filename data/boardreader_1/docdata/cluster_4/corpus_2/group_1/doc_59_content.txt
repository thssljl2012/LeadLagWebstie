 Hmmm...       The Times  isn&amp;#039;t as convinced as The Mail        Quote:                          United close in on deal for Dimitar Berbatov    Oliver Kay    Manchester United are determined to complete the signing of Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur before the start of the new Barclays Premier League campaign this weekend, but  relations between the clubs remain frosty  as the Premier League prepares to pass judgment on Tottenham&amp;#039;s complaint about their rivals&amp;#039; pursuit of the Bulgaria forward.       The Premier League&amp;#039;s board will meet tomorrow or on Thursday to discuss Tottenham&amp;#039;s complaint about United&amp;#039;s pursuit of Berbatov, which Daniel Levy, the London club&amp;#039;s chairman, has described as disgraceful. Levy claims to have evidence that United have systematically been working to prise [Berbatov from Tottenham] outside of Premier League rules of conduct, although publicly he has stopped short of accusing them of making an illegal approach, which would constitute breaches of the league&amp;#039;s regulations K3 and K8.       United have been bewildered by Tottenham&amp;#039;s actions and have submitted their own observations to the Premier League, detailing dialogue and written communication between David Gill, their chief executive, and Levy over the past 12 months. They make no secret of their interest in Berbatov, which Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed publicly, but maintain that they have acted properly since first registering their interest with Tottenham more than a year ago.       Tottenham are understood to be resigned to losing Berbatov, but,  having rejected an official bid of 20.5 million from United last month, they maintain that they will not sell for less than 30 million . Berbatov, for his part, is determined to move to Old Trafford, having made clear his ambition to play Champions League football.       A new centre forward is Ferguson&amp;#039;s priority in the transfer market with Louis Saha likely to be offloaded after a series of injury problems and uncertainty over whether Manucho Goncalves, the Angola forward, will be granted a work permit.       United have been linked with a bid to sign Thierry Henry, the former Arsenal forward, from Barcelona, but the most likely alternative to Berbatov this summer is Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, the 25-year-old Ajax forward.       Sources in Spain suggest United are interested in David Silva, the Valencia midfield player, but a deal is thought unlikely at present, with the 22-year-old widely expected to join Barcelona if he leaves Valencia.
