                                                                   Originally Posted by  Nimuae                                           When my PC was hacked a couple of months ago, I thought it best to change my banking details - just in case!   Spoke to NatWest, told them what had happened, they reset everything for me, and posted new security details.  They could not have been more helpful.                           Exactly, that&amp;#039;s what &amp;amp;quot;most banks&amp;amp;quot; would do. Sadly, &amp;amp;quot;most banks&amp;amp;quot; refuse to deal with someone who has not gone even 1p overdrawn in 10 years, earns a good salary and has no adverse entries on their credit file, preferring instead to deal with 18 year olds going to university who are going to run up massive debts and then declare themselves bankrupt.        I have a finite choice of either Barclays (who only took me because they had no choice, I was already a customer of The Woolwich, an excellent bank that they bought and then closed down, transferring all the accounts to Barclays) or Lloyds TSB.      I am confident I can get more sense out of Lloyds TSB if I go to the local branch - they were very good last summer when they set up my ISA savings account.      The Lloyds account would be good, because if I have my salary paid in they can upgrade the account to a Classic Plus which will pay me 4.00% interest on the balance (as opposed to 0.10% I get with Barclays).
