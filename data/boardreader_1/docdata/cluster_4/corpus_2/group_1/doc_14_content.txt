And a &amp;#039;Credit Card&amp;#039; is where you spend money that you don&amp;#039;t have and pay it back - nothing like a debit card.                         I didnt say you need your parents to open a Paypal account. I said you need your parents to open a Barclays Bank account.     And I said &amp;amp;quot;CashCard&amp;amp;quot; not Credit Card. A Cashcard is barclays own card. It has no chip on it or anything, just a 16 Digital Card number, no CVV etc.          Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Jack120                         .     Unless you don&amp;#039;t mind been over drawn, buy sumin in a shop, then straight away go to a ATM and take cash out    Don&amp;#039;t do that,  some banks charge even more for going overdrawn .                      Unless you have a Student account which allows you to go overdrawn by around 1,500 and gives you up to 4 months to repay also with no interest and no overdrawn charge.
