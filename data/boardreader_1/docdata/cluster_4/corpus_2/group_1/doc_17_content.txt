  A debit card offered by Barclays that lets you withdraw cash from any Barclays, Woolwich, PLUS or LINK cash machine - as long as you have the money in your account. You can use it in stores displaying the VISA Electron sign and some will allow you up to 50 cashback when you&amp;#039;re shopping. Unlike a Connect card, VISA Electron cannot be used as a cheque guarantee card.
