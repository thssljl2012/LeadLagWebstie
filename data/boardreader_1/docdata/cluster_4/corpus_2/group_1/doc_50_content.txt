You could always make a complaint to Barclays about it. They will be worried about their rep. Also about paying them off too. When was the loan taken out because they are known for using rule 78 on older loans when you settle with them. This can bring about a settlement figure more than what you borrowed. Have a look at your agreement and see what it says for settlement as if you request a figure they often raise the interest the month after. They did with me.                      What do you know, I got a letter from    BARCLAYS FIRST PLUS    this morning putting my interest rate up!
