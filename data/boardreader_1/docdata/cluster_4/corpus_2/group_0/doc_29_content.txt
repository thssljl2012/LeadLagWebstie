As an African-American, I am insulted by this. Does everyone think that all black churches have screaming preachers, fainting and yelling women wearing ostentatious hats and ghetto speak? I do NOT go to churches like that; I&amp;#039;ve made it a point to avoid them like the plague. My family never attended churches like that and I&amp;#039;m really glad. Even though they are doing the works of the Lord, I&amp;#039;m really turned off by that kind of preaching.         &amp;amp;nbsp;    you didn&amp;#039;t see it?&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; you pretty much described the commercial with 100% accuracy.&amp;amp;nbsp; I didn&amp;#039;t even mention the big floppy hats or women fanning themselves to avoid fainting.&amp;amp;nbsp; But they were there..    &amp;amp;nbsp;    The other indefensible act comes at the end, with the insurance agent letting out an &amp;quot;mmmmm-hhmmmm&amp;quot; while her head is violently bobbing like wanda sykes with parkinson&amp;#039;s...        &amp;amp;nbsp;    Some of that is in the ad. I didn&amp;#039;t see a  screaming preacher, fainting and yelling women wearing ostentatious hats and ghetto speak. The minister was low-key and did say brother instead of groom, which I have heard before. Nobody fainted or even yelled. &amp;amp;nbsp;There was a&amp;amp;nbsp;woman wearing a&amp;amp;nbsp;good sized&amp;amp;nbsp;hat and fanning herself, but no one fainted. That same woman said   &amp;quot;hallejulah!!&amp;quot;, but if you didn&amp;#039;t listen for it, you&amp;#039;d miss it.&amp;amp;nbsp; The insurance agent did do that overworked side to side movement when she finished up. All in all, it wasn&amp;#039;t as awful as some here describe it.&amp;amp;nbsp; I&amp;#039;m trying to put the link to the commercial on YouTube.     &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBCAg-RrQvg
