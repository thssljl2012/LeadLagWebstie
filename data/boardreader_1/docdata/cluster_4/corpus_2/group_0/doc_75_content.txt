  Marshallka + tiggrae,     Thought i would give you an update about  Barclays Bank.      They are only giving me back 622.74 for the first Loan,         2nd loan they credited 999.82 the remainder from the first loan (hope all this makes sense guys. this was to lower the 2nd loan apparently, that is what she told me....     They have restructured the loan, the existing ppi 3808.20 and been credited the the new loan of 8,400.00 term 60months..     Tiggrae i mentioned about your figures she didn&amp;#039;t say anything..      Not too sure if they are playing ball or just been favourable to the banks...     Any ideas, shall i still take it up with F.O.     thanks for all your help.
