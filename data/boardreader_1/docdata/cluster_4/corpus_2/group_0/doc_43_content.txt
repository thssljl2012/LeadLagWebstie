Because it worked SO well with Alliant.            when are you getting nasa or patelco?     11 inquiries on Experian are making me hesitant. But, I&amp;amp;quot;m sure I can overcome that.    Bob      Get over it and get both of them.     I have both 50K cards.         Yup, living up to your rep.    Bob      did you expect any different from me?
