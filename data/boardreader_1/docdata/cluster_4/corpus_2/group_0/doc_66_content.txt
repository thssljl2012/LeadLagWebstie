 Hi guys, i was supposed to hear back from barclays before the 22nd July but still have heard nothing. Nothing else from skillstrain either apart from the letter of acknowledgemnt.    It&amp;#039;s ok skillstrain saying all their course work is kept up to date, this could be a case of them updating the work very recently because of complaints and a way of getting round refunds, there not gonna pull that one on me!! It still doesn&amp;#039;t alter the fact that my course work is quite clearly out of date and that they have never bothered to get in touch with me for several months when i decided to stop doing the course, it also doesn&amp;#039;t alter the fact that i was told by the course advisor that a CIW was the equivalent of a uni degree.    It would be interesting to see the course work they are currently giving out and compare it to what i have. At the end of the day, they sold me a useless product with a qualification that doesn&amp;#039;t justify the fee and their level of contact with students is appalling.      I will be phoning Consumer Direct again in the morning to bring them up to date and see what the next step is. If i have to go down the solicitor route then i will, i feel that strongly about this and i know i also have consumer direct on my side.      I wonder if they are linked with the booze industry, coz it&amp;#039;s enough to drive you to drink
