 I&amp;#039;ve long been against this group as well, possibly for at least 10 years.  They started out with wonderful focused message, but later on they got into areas concerning motorists that have nothing to do with their original mission.  They&amp;#039;re quite militant regarding issues in local state governments that have absolutely nothing to do with drunk driving and associated fatalities, like mandatory seatbelts, etc., and support the insurance lobby soaking drivers for violations that got nobody killed or injured.  It&amp;#039;s quite a fascist group in tone and practice, and they regard motorists as a target of opportunity.  This is not the nicey nice organization they&amp;#039;ve been made out to be and which they were in the past.  People should really do their homework when they throw these sort of attacks against people like McCain out there, because it&amp;#039;s not always as simple and straight forward as they would have you believe and a common sense reading of this WHOLE particular issue would have you on Cindy&amp;#039;s side for sure.  I cannot tell how thrilled I am that this was brought up today so I could have this little rant about MADD.          MADD founder Candy Lightner broke ties with the group in the 1980s. In 2002, she told the Washington Times: &amp;amp;quot;[MADD] has become far more neo-prohibitionist than I had ever wanted or envisioned ... I didn&amp;#039;t start MADD to deal with alcohol. I started MADD to deal with the issue of drunk driving.&amp;amp;quot;      MADD regularly ignores its principles to keep its coffers full. In 2000, two California ballot initiatives (Propositions 30 and 31) sought to permit an automobile accident victim to sue the at-fault driver&amp;#039;s insurance company if legitimate claims weren&amp;#039;t paid promptly. Considering that victims of drunk drivers stood to gain an important legal tool, most Californians expected MADD to lead the charge in favor of these new measures. However, MADD aligned itself with a group of out-of-state insurance companies, which collectively ran a $1 million-per-week advertising campaign against the propositions ... The organization&amp;#039;s motive? Money, plain and simple. MADD&amp;#039;s 1999-2000 annual report acknowledges Allstate Insurance Company donated an amount in the &amp;amp;quot;$250,000 and above&amp;amp;quot; category. Nationwide Mutual Insurance gave over $100,000 that year.
