      Quote:                         Birth control pills PREVENT major insurance claims like abortions for unplanned pregnancies, prevent pregnancy (which is a huge cost) clear up acne (can be a huge cost).                          I spent 30 years as an Actuary for a nationally well-known health insurance company.        First, abortion, as a means of birth control (as opposed to BC pills), is NEVER covered by private insurance.  It would only be covered to prevent the death of the mother.      Second, clearing up acne is also not covered, as it is considered along the lines of plastic surgery.  If the acne is not caused by a serious underlying medical condition, it&amp;#039;s something that you deal with, on your own.        So covering the cost of BC pills does not provide a cost-savings.  It would be covered if it was used to treat something like dysmenorrhea or amenorrhea.  Actuaries spend most of their time pulling and analyzing data from their paid claims data bases in order to determine the cost&amp;amp;gt;benefit of any proposed change in benefits.      FlaJim - I am in 100% agreement with what you have said, with one exception.  Although you are correct that insurance is controled by each individual state, a nationwide company (say U-haul for instance) can have a nationwide insurance company provide a single identical insurance policy to all of it&amp;#039;s employees, at an identical cost to all employees.  It is an option for the employer. As an underwriter, I used to calculate the rates and benefits for intra-national companies.      Pressure is constantly put upon insurance companies by organized political action committees to provide new benefits, or remove existing limits.  Everytime they are successful, your rates will go up.        AND, FYI, not all insurance companies are in it &amp;amp;quot;to make a profit&amp;amp;quot;.  How many of you know that many (if not all) Blue Cross Blue Shields are registered &amp;amp;quot;NOT-for-profit&amp;amp;quot; companies?  Their purpose is to collect monthly premiums from all insureds, and then use that money to pay the claims for the ill or injured.      I believe that neither Viagra-type prescriptions nor birth-control pills should be covered by insurance companies.
