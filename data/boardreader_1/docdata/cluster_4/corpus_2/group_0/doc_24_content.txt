 1. When are they officially making the move to Brooklyn?  2. Could there possibly be another team in NJ anytime soon or ever?  3. When they move to Brooklyn, what arena/stadium would they play in?    Answers are well appreciated, thanks in advance.     1. 2010  2. No. New Jersey isessentially a NY suburb; therefore, the Knicks and Nets are their local teams.  3. They will play in the Barclays Center.
