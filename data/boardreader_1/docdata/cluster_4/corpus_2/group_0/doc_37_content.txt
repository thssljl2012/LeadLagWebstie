 I agree that she&amp;#039;s handling it better than some posters. It was a mistake, plain and simple. It&amp;#039;s happened before, more often than some people seem to realize, and there isn&amp;#039;t nearly the uproar about a rule being &amp;amp;quot;unfair.&amp;amp;quot; There were no threats to stop watching, or being on the verge of tears, when Paula was disqualified for changing clubs a few years back. Nor, frankly, for any of the other scorecard violations you mentioned.      It&amp;#039;s unfortunate that it happened. As I said, I thought I might have to stand on my word and start a congratulatory thread for her. Let&amp;#039;s look at whose mistake it was, though, people. The simple fact is, she made a mistake, and the penalty is disqualification. Am I happy about it? Not especially. Will I lose sleep over it, or have myself admitted to a psych ward? Not just no, hell no.      As far as playing the third round, I&amp;#039;ll accept the LPGA&amp;#039;s explanation. Maybe it was the fault of the volunteers, who didn&amp;#039;t know what to do. Still, the error was MW&amp;#039;s. Any blame should be placed there.
