i had the same. Applied for the lowest loan on moneysupermarket at 6%APR (barclaycard loans) waited a month for an answer then had the proposal through at 23%. Tossers. Meanwhile i had arranged an instant loan with my bank at 14% and was going to use the barclays one to pay off the lloyds one off (if you paid off in full within 6 weeks no interest). So then i was stuck with the 14% one
