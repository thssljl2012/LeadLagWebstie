        QUOTE (bungy &amp;amp;#064; Jul 7 2008, 02&amp;amp;#58;04 PM)       I think it should be obvious to all that the reason they are doing this is because the OFT is cracking down on charging people for going overdrawn.  However, this is not a charge for going overdrawn, its a charge for using a &amp;amp;quot;service&amp;amp;quot;... clever hey&amp;amp;#33;      Clever loophole. Its still going to suck in MSE type people even if they call it Certain-death-loan service.
