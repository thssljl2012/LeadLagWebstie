 IF scoring was given to a third party, say the walking scorer, then that person is responsible.      What do you do in a dispute with the scorer. What about when you call a penalty on yourself or take an unplayable. WOuld everything then have to be confirmend with the scorer. What if you disagree at that time. Do you wait and argue. The electronic scoring is fine to get out scoring for the internet, the course leader boards etc, but should not be the offical score.      This is the way golf has been played for the last 150 years with understood rules on scoring. It is your score card that is the offical scoring document and your responsibility that it is correct. No reason to change. This is just another example of when a player has screwed up. It will just go into the history books and the game will move on.
