Thanks for your help guys, according to the manager they have 2 people also checking the envelopes so dont understand how it has disapeared!     Shall i contact the police still?? Barclays are not.                      It is up to Barclays to decide whether to bring in the police or not.  You have been refunded your charges and the cash has been credited to your account.     It is now an internal matter whether Barclays instigate disciplinary action against their staff or to get an engineer in to thoroughly inspect the mechanism of the box in case the envelope is still in there somewhere!
