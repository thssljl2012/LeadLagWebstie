 Here goes.... PLEASE READ.      I&amp;#039;m still using v1.3.7 because I need to use barclays epdq module.      My issue is that when someone orders a product I get an extra amount added after Step 3 of 3 - Order Confirmation page. So for example,      Sub-Total:145.00   Courier (UK):15.00    (ZONE TABLES)   VAT:28.01   Total:188.01  (Think I have an extra penny on here for somereason but might be wrong.)         Anyway my issue is when I click confirm the order.   I go off to the barclays epdq page taking a total of 190.64      If I go to my orders page I see,      ID Payment Shipping Customers Order Total Date Purchased Status Action     98 GV/DC poszonetable  Tim Wright 190.64 07/24/2008 16:36:17 Pending      98 GV/DC poszonetable  Tim Wright 188.01 07/24/2008 16:36:17 Pending       so I have a duplicate entry for id 98      and if I then go into the invoice I then get       Sub-Total: 145.00    Sub-Total: 145.00    Courier (UK): 15.00    Courier (UK): 15.00    VAT: 28.01    VAT: 30.64    Total: 188.01    Total: 190.64       So the order twice, I have worked out that the difference between the 190.64 and the 188.01 is the VAT on the delivery being added twice??      I&amp;#039;m stuck please HELP someone!!      Thanks,   Tim Wright
