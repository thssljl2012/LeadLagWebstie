  Hmm. I&amp;#039;ve paid my current bill - via the actual site, it worked this time (possibly I didn&amp;#039;t have NoScript set properly before) - but the site says the bill&amp;#039;s still due by the 11th. It was definitely paid, as a quick online check of my Barclays Connect account showed. How long does it take the site to update, i.e. &amp;#039;this bill has been paid&amp;#039;?
