        QUOTE   Chelsea have moved ahead of Barcelona in the race to sign Andrei Arshavin with Russias Euro 2008 star due in London today for talks over a move to Stamford Bridge.  Arshavin has spoken about his dream of playing for Barca having supported them as a boy, but Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is confident he will persuade his countryman to snub a move to Spain.  Zenit St Petersburg have accepted 12million bids from both clubs after Arshavin told the UEFA Cup holders of his determination to leave at a meeting yesterday.  Former Stamford Bridge boss Jose Mourinho has questioned Arshavins maturity and consistency but Abramovich appears to have no such concerns and is expected to be present at negotiations.  A deal for the 27-year-old could be tied up by as early as this weekend but Chelseas summer spending is unlikely to end there, with new boss Luiz Felipe Scolari keen to add Brazil striker Robinho to the already confirmed signings of Portugal stars Jose Bosingwa and Deco for a combined fee of over 24m.   Another option apparently being considered by Real is a swap deal involving Robinho and Didier Drogba, with Scolari understood to be ready to offload the Ivory Coast striker, who also interests AC Milan.   Sources in Russia suggest Arshavins family are trying to talk him into a move to the Barclays Premier League with his mother Tatyana and wife Yulia both said to believe it would be easier for him and his two children to settle in England rather than Spain.      Lol even his family trying to talk him into a move to England, I think Spain or England would be good places to settle though.
