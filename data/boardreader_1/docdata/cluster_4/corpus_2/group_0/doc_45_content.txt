  I am planning on reclaiming my bank charges, but I have a few questions. (I did have a flick through the stickies, I promise!!)    1. Can I reclaim charges from a bank account that has now been closed?  2. Can I reclaim charges from a loans company, who charge me 20 each time I miss a payment?  3. Who can give me a bank account, bearing in mine I have two default notices?  4. What is the likelyhood of Lloyds TSB closing my bank account when I claim? (I have a Select account with them, but will be reclaiming charges on this.)
