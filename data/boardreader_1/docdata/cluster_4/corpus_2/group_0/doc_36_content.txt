According to an average &amp;amp;quot;2.53&amp;amp;quot; price/sales ratio on  June30th of 12 companies in Mivas indus/peer group  (Cnic 0.90, Driv 3.96, Goog 9.13, Iaci 0.83, Insp  1.95, Iusa 0.36, Look 1.11, Locm 2.07, Mchx 3.48, Thk  0.37, Vclk 2.17, Yhoo 4.00), Mivas &amp;amp;quot;MIN&amp;amp;quot; pps should  be $10.53. Including first quarter rev, their  trailing 12 month(ttm) rev is 142.71m; and, as of  June 16th 2008 according to the CFO whom I emailed,  they have 34.28m basic common shares outstanding.  With these figures, Mivas p/s is only 0.25. (min.  worth calculated by mult. &amp;amp;quot;2.53 p/s&amp;amp;quot; by &amp;amp;quot;142.71m rev&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;amp; div. the result by &amp;amp;quot;34.28m common stock  outstanding&amp;amp;quot;).        Now, the reality. Many companies get sold for &amp;amp;quot;AT  LEAST&amp;amp;quot; 2-3xrev(Beas was sold for about 5xrev; Msft  offered Yhoo almost 6xrev and, Yhoo wants more; CBS  now buying Cnet for just over 4xrev). &amp;amp;quot;IF&amp;amp;quot; Miva is  sold, it is very likely they would &amp;amp;quot;AT LEAST&amp;amp;quot; be  valued between 2.5rev ($10.96pps) and  3xrev($13.15pps).        Institutional ownership is also impressive and  &amp;amp;quot;FACTUAL&amp;amp;quot;. Below are the big holders from the sec  filings(Nasdaq.com) ending March 31st . According to  Nasdaq, institutional ownership is 59% &amp;amp;quot;NOT COUNTING&amp;amp;quot;  insider holdings (percentage may be more if I  understand correctly Mivas first quarter report and  Nasdaq updates the basic common shares outstanding  from 34m to 32.546m. Hmmm, decrease in float  sounds  interesting).    William Blair Co(4,032,984), Coghill  Capital(3,336,016), Diker(2,800,307), Peninsula  Capital(2,000,000), Royce &amp;amp; Assoc.(1,866,212), Morgan  Stanley(1,529,679), Dimensional Fund(903,022),  Renaissance Technologies(859,200), Barclays Global  Investors(717,929), JP Morgan Chase(452,032),  Vanguard Group(362,693), Hennessy Funds(308,000),  Axa(199,094), Stifel Nicolaus &amp;amp; Co(137,957),  UBS(125,709)        Also, could Motley Fools article on 04/04/2008  entitled &amp;amp;quot;5 Promising Internet Stocks Under $12&amp;amp;quot; be  saying they think Miva must be worth &amp;amp;quot;AT LEAST&amp;amp;quot; $12  pps?        Finally, 3 points to consider in relation to Mobile  advertising in Western  Europe:    1. Mobile Advertising expected to rise in Western  Europe.    &amp;amp;quot;FIRST PREVIEW OF GOOGLES ANDROID PHONE&amp;amp;quot; (May 30th  article from TIMES ONLINE) reports the following: &amp;amp;quot;In  Western Europe, the spend on mobile advertising is  expected to rise from $1 billion in 2008 to $1.5  billion this year.&amp;amp;quot;    http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/...        2. Miva already connected with mobile via  &amp;amp;quot;GreenLight  Wireless.&amp;amp;quot;    &amp;amp;quot;MIVA MEDIA ANNOUNCES U.S. AND U.K. PAY-PER-CLICK  AGREEMENTS WITH GREENLIGHT WIRELESS,&amp;amp;quot; (March 12th  article from Yahoo headlines) mentions that: &amp;amp;quot;The  agreements will see MIVAs Pay-Per-Click ads  displayed to consumers accessing Greenlight Wireless  portfolio of U.S. and U.K. partner sites from their  mobile phones. This partner network includes national  news, entertainment and network operator sites that  generate over 30 million mobile searches per month.&amp;amp;quot;    http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080312/200803120...        3. Now, we have &amp;amp;quot;Google&amp;amp;quot; stepping in. And, we know  Miva is already connected with  Google.    &amp;amp;quot;FIRST PREVIEW OF GOOGLES ANDROID PHONE&amp;amp;quot; (May 30th  article from TIMES ONLINE) reports the following:  &amp;amp;quot;Google, which handles about 80 per cent of search  queries in the UK, also hopes that by helping to  produce a phone that will make it easier to use the  web, it will tap a new source of revenue - namely  advertisements that appear on web pages viewed on  mobile  phones.&amp;amp;quot;    &amp;amp;quot;The search company reported revenues of just over  $5 billion in the last quarter, but the vast majority  came from adverts viewed on personal computers. In  Western Europe, the spend on mobile advertising is  expected to rise from $1 billion in 2008 to $1.5  billion this year.&amp;amp;quot;    http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/...
