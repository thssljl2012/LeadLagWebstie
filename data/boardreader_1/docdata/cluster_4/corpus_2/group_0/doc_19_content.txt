I have had SF for the past seven years and they are &amp;quot;Not A Good Neighbor&amp;quot;.  They will only do what is stated within the policy.  They look at it as if they &amp;quot;bend the policy for one person they&amp;#039;ll have to do it for everyone else&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#039;s sad but that is just the way MOST insurance companies are this day and age.  Why don&amp;#039;t several of her REAL neighbors (YOU and others) get together one Saturday morning and take care of the rest of the tree for her?  You might be able to enlist help from her church group or the local scouts.  You might even ask her SF agent to come over and help!  It&amp;#039;s worth a try.
