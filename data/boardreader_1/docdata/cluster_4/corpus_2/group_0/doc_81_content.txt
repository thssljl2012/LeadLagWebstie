Personal accounts      Account charge (usually 4 wondered if linked to service as appears regularly?)  cannot claim      Overdraft usage fee  can claim   Overdraft interest  Can claim if claiming compound interest if not hen you cannot claim      Unauthorised borrowing fee  can claim      CAIS coll AC  don&amp;#039;t know what this is!      ATM Owner fee  cannot claim        Business account      CHG Refund of Interest  Cannot claim  as this is money they have already given you!!      Charges (then it lists certain period dates between)     Unauthorised borrowing fee  Can claim      Solutions Charge  Don&amp;#039;t know what this is but sounds like it&amp;#039;s something that you can claim      Bus focus fee  Still don&amp;#039;t know what this is!!         Then its just a case of adding it all up sticking it in the calculator puting the final figure into the letter and off to the post office I go! 1 down another 5 to go!        Many thanks.                         Hi            which calculator have you decided to use?           It may be worth calling your branch and asking for an explanation        of           CAIS coll AC         Bus Focus Fee        Solutions Charge            Then paste what they say on here and we&amp;#039;ll help you.           Don&amp;#039;t forget to keep your buisness and personal account claims seperate. When you get to the court stage put BUISNESS ACCOUNT CHARGES RECLAIM at the top so that it doesn&amp;#039;t get stayed. At the moment ALL personal account reclaims are being stayed.           Do you qualify under Hardship rules ?        Read this thread to see              http://www.legalbeagles.info/forums/...ead.php?t=9760              Paste 78 gives you the details           goodluck and don&amp;#039;t worry about asking more questions
