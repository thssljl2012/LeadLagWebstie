I&amp;#039;m trying to help my mom to reclaim back her bank charges with Lloyds TSB. I applied for her statements of bank charges prior to the big case going to court, however i did not know how to calculate the charges and i am still unsure, hence why its been left so long!. It may just be me trying to over complicate things...     do i just calculate EACH charge on the statement... there are different types of charges on the statesments and i am unsure... i have noted these as follows:...  1. type=fee and description = account charge.   2. type=chg and description = o/draft interest   3. type=chg and description = o/draft excess fee   4. type=chg and description=unpaid d/d   5.type=chg and description =transactions     i am trying to claim back for several accounts, so i then calculate the charges separately.?                      OK account charge - charge for the type of account you hold - not claimable  same with overdraft interest     Claimable, o&amp;#039;draft excess &amp;amp;amp; unpaid D/d
