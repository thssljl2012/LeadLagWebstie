 Hi      Just a fast question, I thought the longer you drive, the cheaper will be the car insurance - walao just receive the quote from AIG quote 9XX as compared to last year i paid of 8XX, same AIG.      Is it because i stupid stupid stick to one insurance company and never bother to get quotes from others OR the vehicle insurance is getting more expensive?  Thanks.
