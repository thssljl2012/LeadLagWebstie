     Steve, that sounds more like Invoice Factoring - Where the bank will give you say 90% of an invoice as soon as it is raid=sed, and then chase the debtor for the full 100%, and prob charges for late payment on top... As you said though - Very profitable... For the bank...      My bank (Natwest) keep offering me the &amp;quot;service&amp;quot; - Erm, no, I prefer to get 100% of my invoices thanks....         Mike             1998 Citroen Dispatch - 1.9Td XUD/Bosch - 1500 miles on the svo... Now on it&amp;#039;s fifth full tank of B100..   2003 Volvo XC90 D5 2.4D Auto... On it&amp;#039;s 6th tank of B100!
