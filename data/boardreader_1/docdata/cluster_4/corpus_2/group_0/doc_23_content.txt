If I had somehow gotten that up to $15k-$20k, would Amazon have given me $20k, or are new lines always relatively low?    It&amp;#039;s so variable, it&amp;#039;s not even funny.  BofA gave me $10K without blinking. Barclays/Juniper gave me $500. In each case, I already had a CU card with a $27K CL displaying.  People with super-high scores and squeaky clean reports can start out with very high initial CL&amp;#039;s, although these days, even that isn&amp;#039;t necessarily happening.  I think BofA likes to match, at least within the limits of an applicant&amp;#039;s credit report. (It&amp;#039;s already up to $18K.) Barclays told me that it appeared that I already had plenty of available credit, so $500 was all I needed. Hard to argue with that.  The majority of BofA cards (and most CU cards) don&amp;#039;t have much in the way of rewards, so I look on their willingness to give high limits as their version of rewards. &amp;amp;nbsp; ---------------------------  Long-term goal:  &amp;quot;Whats hurting your FICO score: There are no negative reasons significantly affecting your FICO Score.&amp;quot; 6/1/2008: Creeping back upward: EQ 705 - TU 724 - EX 723 - Waiting it out   Really,  really   done credit hunting; time for credit gardening    FICO High Achievers   -   FICO 08: AU to Joint   -  FICO Score Estimator  -  Score Watch Alerts
