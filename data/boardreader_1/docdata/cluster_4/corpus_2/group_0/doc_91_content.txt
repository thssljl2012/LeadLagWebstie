  does he really use the train much to make the rail card worthwhile?    I would say go for Alliance and Leicester Premier 21, Barclays Young Person or Lloyds TSB Under 19s. They all have a Visa debit, and not a Solo.     Alliance and Leicester don&amp;#039;t have offers, but they have 10% interest, and if you PM me your e-mail, I can refer you and we both get 25 =)    But anyway, these are all decent, but Barclays aren&amp;#039;t very good for online banking
