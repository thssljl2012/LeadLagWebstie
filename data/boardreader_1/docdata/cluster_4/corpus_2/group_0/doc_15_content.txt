 ^^ It may be money left over from a 6 or 12 month premium that you still owe them.  I know with mine they always bill you at 1/3/6/12 month prices ad you pay whichever you want.  If you were doing monthly then maybe you owed for the rest of that cycle since I&amp;#039;m pretty sure you pre-pay premiums.  I also agree that it&amp;#039;s BS to base premiums on credit scores.  You could suck at paying bills and be the best driver in the world and never get into an accident.  If you don&amp;#039;t pay your insurance bill then you lose it and you&amp;#039;re screwed so I don&amp;#039;t understand how they justify it.
