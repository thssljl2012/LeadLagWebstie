This may be the end of the LPGA if they do not correct their blunder (at least my watching). Really, in all of golf, has anyone else been DQed for signing the card outside the magic tent? I mean, how exactly could signing the card outside the tent be an advantage to her? The witness theory is all wet, your opponent keeps your score during the round, they are witnessing each hole. They sign the card, you sign the card. You are witnessing that they recorded your score correctly. This is completely different than signing an incorrect score card. There is no justification for requiring the signing be done inside a magic tent. AND there is no justification for the rules officials not just keeping her inside the magic tent. What if she had to use the ladies room immediately after her round - would she be DQed because she did not immediately sign the card (that is in their goofy rules also). This forum needs to lead a protest against the LPGA. Blog everywhere about the injustice. Make golf get real.
