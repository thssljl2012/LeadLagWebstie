That&amp;#039;s what I always use, nice and easy!                        Remember, this only works in the coreespondent bank&amp;#039;s home country. Thus a Barclays Bank outside the UK would charge a fee to a B of A customer.       As to credit cards Capital One still doesn&amp;#039;t tack on an additional percentage fee on non-dollar purchases.
