 The bank I&amp;#039;m with uses Maestro debit cards which quite frankly are rubbish abroad.  In the states you need a Visa card or you&amp;#039;re stuffed.  Natwest simply dont do them!      What banks do people recommend that come with a Visa debit facility.  I dont want Lloyds, barclays or HSBC due to working for one in the past and having bad experiences with the others!      Over to you to &amp;amp;quot;Spec me a bank&amp;amp;quot;!
