I think you&amp;amp;#039;ve got those predictions pretty much spot on, Phil.  One game at a time is the best policy though. I&amp;amp;#039;ve seen too many of these sorts of threads go arse over end when we lose or draw the first two games.   Really looking forward to the derby game - should be a win worth celebrating.
