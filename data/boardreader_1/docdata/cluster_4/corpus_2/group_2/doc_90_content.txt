Other NCAA teams playing at this tourney include Winston-Salem State, Norfolk State, and Howard. Along with VCU, these teams are playing local teams the College of the Bahamas, New Providence All-Stars, the Cybots, Commonwealth Bank and a BBF select side.   VCU played the College of The Bahamas yesterday at 2 p.m., and then the Cybots at 6 p.m. Today, VCU played Malcolm Park at 1 p.m. I&amp;#039;ll do my best to find out how they did.    Thanks District.  I just cannot believe that there is not even a paragraph in the Richmond Times Disgrace about us playing in the Bahamas?  How many articles were there on the UR trip to Europe?  Oh and I forgot, another front page article on the Rodney Monroe degree...geesh will they ever let it drop?     VCUBeatsduke
