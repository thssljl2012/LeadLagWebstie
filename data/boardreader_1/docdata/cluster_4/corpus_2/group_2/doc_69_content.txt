 It&amp;#039;ll be hard to leave Darren Fletcher out for a while, I think. He&amp;#039;s starting to look like a very competent player. And Brown is a better right back than Neville.  Bosingwa has impressed me a lot, I thought he might of been one of those fullbacks who can&amp;#039;t defend but he looks to at least near the same level as the likes of Cole and Evra.
