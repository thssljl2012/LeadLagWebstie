  Sunderland are wankers!    Chappy, you have to remember that the league has shown lots of favoritism towards the top 4 and Newcastle. Sad really. We need a director that knows what&amp;#039;s right for the sport and the game, not for a club.  Guthrie&amp;#039;s tackle was severe. It wasn&amp;#039;t needed and it broke Fagan&amp;#039;s leg. It should have been a six match ban.
