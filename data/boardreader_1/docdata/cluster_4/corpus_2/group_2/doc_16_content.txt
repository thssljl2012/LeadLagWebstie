            Quote from: Alloy on  Yesterday  at 06:30:01 PM   The bitters worry me most, I&amp;amp;#039;m almost relived they pulled it back today, otherwise they would be like rabid dogs next week to put it right.   2 days ago I would have disagreed but thought the same meself today. Once the game had finished I was in a way glad they draw the game, as losing would have just fired them up more for saturday. Now they&amp;amp;#039;ll be more confident, which will suit us. Let them come out of the traps and we will get more space for our extra quality to hurt them. Be lying if I haven&amp;amp;#039;t got that sick feeling now that they just might catch us in a blip, and get one set piece goal from Yakubu or Cahill while we miss 25 chances trying to walk it into the net. Gutted as 2 days ago the thought of we might get beat or held to a draw was nowhere in my mind. Fucking Stoke
