   quote  Subaru    Keane is not utilising his teammates and if he does, he uses the wrong one.   Whaaat?  Didn&amp;#039;t you see the through ball that Keane set-up first time for Torres to poke in. Or didn&amp;#039;t you see the second one which opened Dirk Kuyt who gave Torres the chance. Keane might not have scored but he is helping the team a lot.
