          I think in these run of&amp;amp;nbsp; fixtures then not losing certainly isnt over-rated, if we take 4 points from everton and city away games i think that would be a good start, i dont think that many/if any teams will take 6 from those 2 away fixtures.. the 2 home games are vitally important that we win so that would be 10/12 then the chelsea game... theyre very strong at home so a draw would be a good result, id be very happy taking 11/15 which would also mean chelsea would have dropped at least 2 points in the same 5 game run.. drawing isnt the end of the world, it just depends who were drawing against. i think 11 is very realistic...
