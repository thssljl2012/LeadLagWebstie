    quote   Andy_Jay1987     Him and his stupid Manuel from Fawlty Towers accent can *bleep* off back to seville for all I care.   I do hope to god that you aren&amp;#039;t a Spurs supporter because if you are then i feel sorry for the other fans who&amp;#039;ll have to put up with your clap-trap. Juande Ramos is probably the best thing that&amp;#039;s happened to Tottenham in a long time. He has brought them a trophy, more what do you want? You ain&amp;#039;t gonna win the Premiership unless you have a billionaire or 4, you can&amp;#039;t attract the players so you can&amp;#039;t expect him to do well straight away. Every team starts off differently , some just get better later on . Give him time and he&amp;#039;ll perform trust me. If you stick by him, you&amp;#039;ll finish with a top 6 place at least.
