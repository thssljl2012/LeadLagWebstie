   quote   vezsreds     Honestly i can&amp;#039;t remember one liverpool fan on this forum saying we will definetly win the league this year at all, yet alone just becaus we signed Keane.    Some Liverpool fans say that but they don&amp;#039;t elaborate so it gets taken out of context. It&amp;#039;s not just &amp;#039;cos of Keane, he&amp;#039;s just our biggest signing, Reira will help also...
