   quote   Jaffers       quote   D I O S     Also, Anelka is class, Chelsea have *bleep*ed him up, because he was just amazing for us!      I wouldn&amp;#039;t say he was class, he should of easily scored today. How he failed to put in that cross from Joe Cole is beyond me, he just did a 360 spin when he only needed to stick out a leg.    Which is why I said Chelsea have *bleep*ed him up somehow! Low confidence or whatever, that&amp;#039;s back of the net playing for us!
