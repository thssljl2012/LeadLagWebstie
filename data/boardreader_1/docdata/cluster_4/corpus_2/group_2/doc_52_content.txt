         Newcastle v Blackburn: Preview      Newcastle striker Obafemi Martins could be out of action for six weeks after suffering a knee injury in midweek.  Martins had a scan on Thursday night after making his comeback from a groin problem in Wednesday&amp;#039;s Carling Cup defeat by Tottenham, and joins fellow frontmen Mark Viduka, Alan Smith and Andy Carroll on the casualty list ahead of the vital Barclays Premier League clash with Blackburn.  Midfielder Ignacio Gonzalez is also out with an Achilles injury, while Danny Guthrie and Joey Barton are still suspended and Habib Beye (Achilles), Jonas Gutierrez (shoulder) and Jose Enrique are also missing.  Joe Kinnear was appointed as interim Newcastle manager - and immediately forecast the Kevin Keegan-Alan Shearer dream ticket could be in place within weeks.  Magpies owner Mike Ashley sprang a major surprise when he asked the 61-year-old former Wimbledon, Luton and Nottingham Forest boss to step into the breech after Terry Venables rejected the temporary post.  Caretaker boss Chris Hughton will be in the dug-out for the clash with Blackburn, but Kinnear will then take over on a contract which will run until the end of October.  That suggests a timeframe for the sale of the club is firmly in place.  &amp;amp;quot;I think the club&amp;#039;s going to be sold at the beginning of October and Chris Hughton needs all the help he can get,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Kinnear told Radio 5 Live.  &amp;amp;quot;So if I can get in there and get a few results together until obviously the two main people are named, I assume from the new people coming in they will be Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Investment bankers Seymour Pierce are actively seeking a buyer after billionaire Ashley decided he had had enough following mass protests in the wake of Kevin Keegan&amp;#039;s resignation three weeks ago.  In a statement, Kinnear added: &amp;amp;quot;I am very excited about the challenge in front of me.  &amp;amp;quot;Results have not been great of late, but there is a lot of quality in the squad and I am very confident the players are capable of climbing the league table.  &amp;amp;quot;Newcastle United is a great club. When I was in charge of Wimbledon, I always remember the passion of the fans up there and how great a stadium St James&amp;#039; Park is.  &amp;amp;quot;It is a big challenge, but one I am really looking forward to.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;   Jason Brown will be in goal for Blackburn.  Brown steps in with England goalkeeper Paul Robinson out for two weeks with a calf injury sustained in the midweek Carling Cup defeat of Everton.  Rovers are also without Vince Grella (calf), Steven Reid (knee) and David Dunn (Achilles), while Benni McCarthy (groin) and Aaron Mokoena (virus) are doubtful.  However, midfielder Keith Andrews is available again after missing the Everton match as he was ineligible.  Paul Ince has dismissed suggestions his Blackburn side are facing Newcastle at a good time, given their opponents&amp;#039; troubles on and off the field.  The teams meet at St James&amp;#039; Park with Joe Kinnear named as the Magpies&amp;#039; interim manger, and Ince is expecting a rough ride.  Blackburn go into the game on the back of knocking Everton out of the the Carling Cup and defeating Fulham in the Premier League in the space of four days.  However, Ince is far from complacent and believes the problems in the North East will make it more difficult for his side.  He said: &amp;amp;quot;That makes it harder for us than easier. We are not getting carried away.  &amp;amp;quot;The bottom line is that everyone thinks that because of their problems we should go up there and win the game. But football isn&amp;#039;t like that.  &amp;amp;quot;When those players cross the line all the problems that are going on off the pitch will not affect them one little bit. If they score early then all their troubles are lifted.  &amp;amp;quot;It is a great place to play and they are a good side. The fans will be egging them on, so it will be a tough match.  &amp;amp;quot;But I don&amp;#039;t want my players to worry about what is happening at Newcastle. We have to concentrate on defending well for the first 15-20 minutes.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       ESPNsoccernet
