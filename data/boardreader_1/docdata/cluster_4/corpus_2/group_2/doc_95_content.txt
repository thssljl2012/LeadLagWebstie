   quote   g_lfc     What was that? Its a fast moving thread. Hard to keep up!     Saying it was rich coming from an Arsenal fan.    quote  Football is a game of opinion, and unfortunattly everyone gets one, so people who have no clue will be saying Liverpool are going to win the league. But the same applies to Arsenal fans!! And so many others. For you to judge all Liverpool fans off a few &amp;quot;kids&amp;quot; on this website is ludicris.   I&amp;#039;m not judging ALL Liverpool fans, I wouldn&amp;#039;t be so naive. Maybe I could have worded it so, but what am I meant to base my opinion of them off of? The only ones who I HAVE spoken to, have said what I&amp;#039;ve been repeating.  Matias, I&amp;#039;ve made many a post on the subject before the one you highlighted.
