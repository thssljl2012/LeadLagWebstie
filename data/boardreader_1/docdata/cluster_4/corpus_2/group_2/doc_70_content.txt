         Wigan v Sunderland: Preview      Wigan manager Steve Bruce must assess his international contingent before naming his side for Saturday&amp;#039;s home Barclays Premier League clash against Sunderland.  Jason Koumas (ankle) was ruled out of Wales&amp;#039; trip to Russia while Maynor Figueroa, Wilson Palacios, Antonio Valencia and Amr Zaki must prove their fitness.  Emile Heskey is fit after impressing for England though, and Kevin Kilbane came through unscathed for the Republic of Ireland, wearing a mask to protect the fractured cheekbone he suffered in Wigan&amp;#039;s 5-0 win at Hull last time out.  The Black Cats look likely to unleash new signings Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney.  Ferdinand has shaken off the hamstring problem with which he arrived from West Ham, while McCartney is in line for a second bow for the club after returning from Upton Park.  Teemu Tainio could make the squad after recovering from a thigh injury, but skipper Dean Whitehead remains a doubt with a sore hip and Carlos Edwards is unlikely to figure after playing twice for Trinidad and Tobago during the international break.  Striker Michael Chopra is still suspended.  Bruce, meanwhile, fears Sunderland counterpart Roy Keane could be one of a dying breed in the Barclays Premier League.  The former United skipper believes it is getting harder for British and Irish players to follow them into top-flight management.  Gianfranco Zola became the fifth foreign coach in the Premier League when he was appointed as Alan Curbishley&amp;#039;s successor at West Ham, while former England manager Kevin Keegan recently resigned as Newcastle boss.  There were no British or Irish managers on the final shortlist for the West Ham post and Bruce believes ever fewer of the top jobs are available to them.  He and Keane may have become top-flight managers but both only by winning promotion to the Premier League - Bruce with Birmingham in 2002 and Keane with Sunderland in 2007.  &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m delighted Roy&amp;#039;s done so well,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Bruce said. &amp;amp;quot;I always thought he&amp;#039;d stay in the game in some capacity because he loves the game so much.  &amp;amp;quot;But it greatly concerns me that over the past couple of weeks we&amp;#039;ve lost two big personalities and big managers in Kevin Keegan and Alan Curbishley.  &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;ve both graced the Premier League over the last 15 years, they&amp;#039;re both English and both good managers, and we&amp;#039;ve lost them unfortunately.  &amp;amp;quot;If we don&amp;#039;t encourage people like Roy Keane to go into management then I&amp;#039;m scared where we might get to because if we&amp;#039;re not careful, we won&amp;#039;t have any British or Irish managers any more.  &amp;amp;quot;I wish Gianfranco Zola the best of luck, he was a smashing player and a smashing lad, but would us British or Irish coaches get a job in Italy, France or Germany? I doubt it somehow.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       ESPNsoccernet
