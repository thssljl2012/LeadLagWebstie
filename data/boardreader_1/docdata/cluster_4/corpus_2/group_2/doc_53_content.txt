   quote   SuperCesc07     We got the talent,quality,skills u name it , but we aint got the consistency to keep on winning.  That&amp;#039;s pretty much how I see Arsenal too. All of their good players are too inconsistent. You are now probably in the worst position of the top 4 after this result, having played no big games yet.  As for Ronaldo, I think he did dive again to win that penalty from looking at that .gif. He trails his leg to make it look like Samuel made contact with him.
