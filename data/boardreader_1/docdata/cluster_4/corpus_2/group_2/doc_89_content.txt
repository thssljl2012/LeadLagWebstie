 People saying all about United fans shouldn&amp;#039;t of clapped Ronaldo when he came on, how is this situation different from when Drogba said he wanted to leave and told the club he no longer wishes to play for Chelsea etc? He has been welcomed back.  Both  clubs  know that they are a better team with the player so the fans will cheer, not for the player but what they do for the team.
