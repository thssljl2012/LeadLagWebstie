Scolari will speak to the Chelsea board before deciding whether to appeal against the red card that threatens to keep John Terry out of next Sunday&amp;#039;s showdown with Manchester United.          The England captain was dismissed 13 minutes from the end of Chelsea&amp;#039;s 3-1 Barclays Premier League win at Manchester City tonight after bringing down Jo just inside the visitors&amp;#039; half.        Referee Mark Halsey ruled Terry was the last man, even though Ricardo Carvalho was clearly behind his central defensive partner when the incident took place.
