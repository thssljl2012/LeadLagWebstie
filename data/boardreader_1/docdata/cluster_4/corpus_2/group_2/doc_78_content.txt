 I&amp;#039;ve got lot&amp;#039;s of time for Wenger and the way his team plays football, but I really don&amp;#039;t see what his problem is. Would he be saying all of this if it would have been Arsenal instead of City. I think not. Perhaps he&amp;#039;s a little frustrated with the financial situation at Arsenal?      Wenger puzzled by Blues takeover      22/ 9/2008         ARSENAL manager Arsene Wenger admits he can find &amp;amp;quot;no rational answer&amp;amp;quot; as to why the Abu Dhabi United Group wanted to launch a multi-million-pound takeover of Manchester City.      Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan will on Tuesday formally become the new owner of the Eastlands club.      The arrival of the Middle Eastern billionaires has changed the balance of spending power in the Barclays Premier League - which was shown by the shock capture of Brazil forward Robinho in a British record deal from under the noses of Chelsea on deadline day.      Wenger, though, maintains the reason behind the developments in the City boardroom remain a mystery.      Speaking in the October issue of the official Arsenal magazine, Wenger said: &amp;amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t know why these people are in there.      &amp;amp;quot;It doesn&amp;#039;t look like they are there to make any money. So if they are not there to make money out of it, then are they buying it out of love? Well, I am not sure these people are supporters of Manchester City from a young age.      &amp;amp;quot;So then comes a further question: Why are they doing it? Why have they bought the club? I can&amp;#039;t really find a rational answer.&amp;amp;quot;      Wenger added: &amp;amp;quot;If it is just a toy for them then it is even more dangerous.      &amp;amp;quot;You can have 20 billionaires in the Premier League, still only one can win it and one will come last.      &amp;amp;quot;The problem is that when these people who have bought into football get tired of it, what will they leave behind? That is the real question you can ask.      Investment       &amp;amp;quot;If their investment is purely strategic, based on the market interest, then they could easily decide one day that it is not strategic to be in that market any more, and then they will leave.&amp;amp;quot;      City boss Mark Hughes has been promised time for the club&amp;#039;s lofty ambitions of Champions League football to be achieved.      Wenger, whose side currently lead the Barclays Premier League, has made a reputation for spotting talent young and developing potential into world-class ability rather than simply splashing out on big-name signings.      However, the Arsenal manager maintains despite all of the money now within the game, proper etiquette must be observed and not to have players publicly courted by rival clubs.      &amp;amp;quot;My thoughts are that it is good to have money in football, but it&amp;#039;s how you use it. Basically you still have to respect the rules,&amp;amp;quot; Wenger said.      &amp;amp;quot;The football bodies have to be very cautious about that.      &amp;amp;quot;You can&amp;#039;t have a situation where people just come in and say they want to buy (Cristiano) Ronaldo or they want to buy (Fernando) Torres. That is disrespectful. These players are under contract.      &amp;amp;quot;If a player is under contract then you cannot make public comments which destabilise the club.      &amp;amp;quot;What you have to do is first of all ring the player&amp;#039;s club, to ask if they are ready to sell for this price.      &amp;amp;quot;If that doesn&amp;#039;t happen, then you have to shut up.      &amp;amp;quot;I believe that the governing bodies can enforce that because this is happening in public.&amp;amp;quot;      City rants about Wenger&amp;#039;s views.       http://www.manchestereveningnews.co....blues_takeover
