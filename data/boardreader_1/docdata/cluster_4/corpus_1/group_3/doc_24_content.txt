Stephen Ireland denied 10-man Newcastle a precious Barclays Premier League victory with a last-gasp equaliser in a 2-2 draw at St James' Park.Manchester City looked to be cruising to victory when Habib Beye was harshly sent off for a 12th-minute challenge on Robinho, who calmly converted the resulting penalty.But Joe Kinnear's men once again discovered the character which had served them so well at Everton last time out and, remarkably, they were within four minutes of victory when Ireland struck.Robinho looked to have got the better of Beye early on as he burst into the box, but the defender dived in to poke the ball away.However, to his horror, referee Rob Styles pointed to the spot and to compound Beye's astonishment, then produced a red card despite replays suggesting he had a good case.Robinho calmly converted from 12 yards, sending Shay Given the wrong way and leaving a club without a league win since August 23 with a mountain to climb. .But as they did at Everton a fortnight ago, Kinnear's men found a fighting spirit in adversity and pulled level in the 44th minute.Richard Dunne smashed a clearance against the unwitting Damien Duff and when the ball ricocheted to Shola Ameobi, he controlled and managed to steer it past the keeper to repay Kinnear's faith in him.The Newcastle frontman proved a constant thorn in the side of the City defence as the 10-man Magpies kept City on their toes. And with 64 minutes gone when, in his attempt to clear Geremi's right-wing corner, Dunne smashed the ball into the roof of his own net to send St James' into raptures.But City's answer was to attack and after Given produced a stunning save to deny Ireland six minutes from time, he could not repeat the feat two minutes later as the midfielder fired home from close range to claim a point.
