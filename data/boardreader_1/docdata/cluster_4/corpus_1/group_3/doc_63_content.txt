Goalkeeper Boaz Myhill believes Hull are no longer intimidated by the prospect of facing clubs such as Chelsea and Manchester United.The high-flying Tigers begin the most distinguished four days in their history as they host Chelsea on Wednesday before travelling to Old Trafford on Saturday.And a confident Myhill said: 'Just playing against them now isn't enough. A couple of years ago it would have been just a dream to play against them and the result would have been irrelevant.'After a remarkable rise through the divisions and a stunning start to life in the Barclays Premier League, Hull go into Wednesday's clash third and level on points with their visitors.Wales international Myhill, 25, has played in all four divisions with Hull and admits the change in mentality has been remarkable.'The club is in the Premier League now. We know we are always up against it against the big sides, but we have shown we can do all right when we are going really gung-ho,' he said.'We will be large underdogs and they are expected to win wherever they go, but we will give it our best shot and see what happens.'They are two great games to play in and it is not difficult to raise yourself.'Sometimes it takes a bit of getting used to, seeing our names amongst the other names,' he admitted. 'But it is there and long may it continue. We are just trying to establish ourselves at this level.'We have had a good start but we haven't achieved anything yet.'
