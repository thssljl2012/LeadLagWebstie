Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho could be out for a minimum of three weeks after being forced out of Wednesday night's 3-0 victory over Hull.Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari estimated the Portuguese defender may be facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after sustaining a thigh injury near the end of the game.His assessment of Carvalho's injury was made as the team left the KC Stadium following their success over Hull.Goals from Frank Lampard, Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda settled the outcome and kept Chelsea second behind Liverpool at the top of the Barclays Premier League.But Scolari is hopeful that England midfielder Joe Cole will be fit to face Sunderland on Saturday even though the player was substituted after feeling pain in his ankle.
