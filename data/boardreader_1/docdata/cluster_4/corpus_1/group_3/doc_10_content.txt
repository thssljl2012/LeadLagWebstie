Striker Roman Bednar's second-half effort - his third goal of the campaign - ensured back-to-back wins for the Baggies. It was no more than Albion deserved after dominating the second 45 minutes and Bednar could have claimed a hat-trick, hitting the bar from 35 yards and being denied at point blank range by Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Mowbray said: 'We know we played against a decent team, particularly in the first half and, with Clint Dempsey dropping off the front, they gave us plenty of problems. 'They reminded us of our team at our very best in the first half. They moved the ball around well. Jimmy Bullard and Danny Murphy are top players. 'On the second half performance I think we warranted the victory. We had the better chances, created more chances second half and I'm delighted with the effort we put in to get the points. 'The result was important. It keeps the momentum going and gives the players the confidence and belief they can compete in the league and we shouldn't fear whoever we play.' Victory ensured Albion have enjoyed their best start to a Premier League campaign - 10 points from seven games - but Mowbray is not getting carried away, particularly with a trip to Manchester United next on the horizon. He said: 'I don't tend to set targets and goals for the players. The next game is the important one and we've got to be ready to go to Old Trafford, make life difficult for them, and see if we can pick something up there. 'It is a bit early to talk about where we might finish. We've just got to look at the next game. We are happy to pick up the points and happy to keep going along.' West Brom manager Tony Mowbray insists his side have the self belief they need to compete in the Barclays Premier League after a 1-0 victory over Fulham lifted them to eighth place in the table.
