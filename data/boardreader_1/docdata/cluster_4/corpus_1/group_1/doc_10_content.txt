 Mark Clattenburg, one of the Barclays Premier League's most promising young referees, has been backed to make a swift return to officiating duties after being suspended pending a probe into his business affairs.The 33-year-old was pulled out of this weekend's FA Community Shield clash between Manchester United and Portsmouth following allegations he owes 60,000 as a result of a failed venture. Peter Walton will officiate at Wembley instead.But a spokesman for referees' body the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd offered support to the County Durham official saying: 'Mark Clattenburg is one of England's leading referees and we hope to resolve this matter swiftly.' He added: 'It is in the best interests of Mark Clattenburg and the game that these reports are fully investigated and, during that time, he will not referee any matches.' Clattenburg's firm, MC Electrical Retail NE Ltd, was wound up under the Insolvency Act on June 27, Newcastle County Court confirmed.Friend John Hepworth had served the company with legal papers demanding 59,589. When it failed to pay, he took the case to the county court and MC Electrical Retail NE Ltd was wound up.A joint statement from the Football Association and PGMO read: 'PGMO is aware of media reports concerning alleged debts incurred by companies connected to referee Mark Clattenburg. 'It has been decided he will not officiate any matches pending enquiries into the background to these reports. 'The FA has also decided to appoint Peter Walton as referee for Sunday's FA Community Shield between Manchester United and Portsmouth in place of Mark Clattenburg.'
