 Aston Villa 4 Manchester City 2Gabriel Agbonlahor bounced back from his England snub with an eight minute hat-trick as Aston Villa poured more misery on Mark Hughes side in the Barclays Premier League opener at Villa Park.Agbonlahor was left out of the squad by Fabio Capello for Wednesdays friendly with the Czech Republic but took out any disappointment he may have been feeling on City in devastating fashion.It was also a perfect way for Agbonlahor to celebrate after signing a new four-year contract with Villa on Thursday.His Villa team-mate Ashley Young, overlooked as well by Capello, was also in impressive form as he laid on two goals in an impressive all-round display by Martin ONeills side.They attacked with great purpose with John Carew dominating in the air and City only briefly threatened after a defensive mix-up handed them a penalty converted by Elano.It was another blow after the shock UEFA Cup reversal by Danish side FC Midtjylland on Thursday.Little went right for City after they suffered a pre-match setback when striker Valeri Bojinov was injured in the warm-up and he was replaced by 19-year-old Ched Evans with Felipe Caicedo being drafted in as a substitute.It had been scheduled to be Bojinovs first competitive game after a year out with a knee injury he sustained against Manchester United and he appeared on the touch-line at the start of the second period with his right leg in plaster.Villa made a promising start with Carew causing plenty of problems in the air - and the Norway international twice went close to breaking the deadlock.Carew was first to react to a corner from Ashley Young but his glancing header flew just past the far post. Then the Villa striker got on the end of another corner  this time by Gareth Barry  and forced Joe Hart to save away to his right.Michael Johnson blocked a close-range drive from Ashley Young and Carews first-time low drive had Hart sprawling across his goal to collect.City threatened for the first time when Kelvin Etuhu went past Nicky Shorey on the outside before firing a low attempt across the face of Brad Friedels goal with no-one able to apply a finishing touch.But then want-away midfielder Barry squandered a good opportunity for Villa after 26 minutes.Nigel Reo-Coker burst down the right flank and his powerful cross was only parried by Hart into the path of Barry but from eight yards out he hooked the ball wide.Brad Friedel had to make his first save of note after 30 minutes when he got his body behind Martin Petrovs low drive after good play by Gelson Fernandes set up the opportunity.City defender Tal Ben Haim became the first player to receive a yellow card after 33 minutes for a late challenge on Barry who needed treatment but was able to continue.Villa needed only two minutes of the second period to break the deadlock through Carew  last seasons top marksman with 13 goals.Barry found Ashley Young in space on the left flank and the winger sent over the kind of pinpoint cross which Carew thrives on as he sent a powerful header past Hart from six-yards out.City tried to respond instantly and Luke Young did well to block a powerful drive from 15-yards out by Elano.Friedel finger-tipped a low cross shot from Garrido around the post and Martin Petrov volleyed into the side netting.But it needed a mix-up between Luke Young and Shorey to present City with an equaliser after 63 minutes.There appeared to be little danger but the two full-backs hesitated and let in Michael Johnson who was eventually brought down by Luke Young in the box.Referee Phil Dowd immediately pointed to the penalty spot and Elano sent Friedel the wrong way from the spot.But Villa needed only five minutes to regain the lead through Agbonlahor.An Ashley Young corner was turned back across goal by Curtis Davies to Agbonlahor who beat Hart with a right-foot volley and within five minutes Agbonlahor had struck again to double Villas lead.Ashley Young picked out the overlapping Barry and his cross was headed home by the England Under-21 player.Then in the 76th minute Agbonlahor completed his first senior hat-trick when he raced onto a Barry through-ball and clipped the ball past Hart.Corluka scored an 89th minute consolation goal for City but they were well beaten by the final whistle.
