 Tottenham's aspirations of challenging the Barclays Premier League's big four suffered an early setback as Middlesbrough claimed an opening-day 2-1 victory at the Riverside Stadium.Defender David Wheater scored the first in the 71st minute after an Afonso Alves shot had come back off the underside of the crossbar and Mido, on for Alves, turned in a second with four minutes to go.All eyes pre-match had been on Tottenham's Dimitar Berbatov, who has been strongly linked with a move to Manchester United, and his appearance as a 65th-minute substitute did not help Spurs take anything from the game. A late Robert Huth own goal was mere consolation for the Londoners.
