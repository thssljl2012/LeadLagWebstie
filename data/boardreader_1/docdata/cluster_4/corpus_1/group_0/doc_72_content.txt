 BARCLAYS Wealth is beefing up its financial planning team in Edinburgh with four appointments as part of the bank's drive to firmly establish its financial planning department in the capital. Among the new recruits, who will work as financial planners, are Graeme Inglis, who is to move from HBOS, and Paul Turnbull, previously of HSBC. Douglas Noble has been promoted to office head in Edinburgh, while John Godfrey has moved from the Glasgow office to lead the investment management team.
