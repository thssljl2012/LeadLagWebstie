 The Finance Sector union is planning to meet with banks this week in a bid to phase out debt-sales targets.It says staff are being pushed to sign customers up for personal loans, credit cards, and overdrafts, whether they actually want them or not.Finsec spokesman Andrew Campbell says the targets are not a good look, especially coming at the rise of a credit crunch, and they can make working in a bank very unpleasant.He says there is a lot of pressure to drive bargains locking customers into loan and credit deals. Some branches have whiteboards in their tea rooms showing which staff have sold the most credit cards. Campbell says staff who do not reach their sales targets face severe consequences.Campbell says it is unrealistic to expect an immediate change. But if banks do not show any interest in discussing the issue, he says it'll reveal something about their interests.FINSEC meets ANZ National and Westpac Bank this week.It has also gone public to ask the BNZ and the largely non-unionised ASB to make the change in their behaviour.
