 Josep Guardiola has refused to be drawn on speculation linking Barcelona with Barclays Premier League stars Didier Drogba and Emmanuel Adebayor.Reports claim the Nou Camp boss is interested in both Chelsea's Drogba and Arsenal striker Adebayor, but Guardiola was remaining tight-lipped after watching Barca cruise to a 6-0 friendly win over Hibernian at Murrayfield in his first game in charge on Thursday night. 'I'm not here to speak about them,' he said. 'I have many excellent players and I am working with them. All good players are interesting and those players are interesting but there are many, many good players, in England, Germany, everywhere.' Asked whether he was preparing to make a bid, Guardiola added: 'I don't know. The sporting director can talk about that better than me.' Eidur Gudjohnsen helped himself to a double and Lionel Messi, Pedro, Bojan and Yaya Toure all claimed a goal apiece in a game where Messi stole the show in the 45 minutes he was on the park.Guardiola is now seeking a quick resolution over the Argentinian's participation in the Olympic Games in Beijing this summer - a move Barcelona are opposed to. He said: '(FIFA president Sepp) Blatter has to make a decision because we have been waiting a long time for the decision. 'If he has to go according to the law, he goes. If he is to stay according to the law, he stays. But a decision had to be made as quickly as possible.'
