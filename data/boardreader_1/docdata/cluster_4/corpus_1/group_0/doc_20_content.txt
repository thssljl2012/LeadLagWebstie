 A subsidiary of the ANZ National Bank has been fined for running misleading ads on television. ANZ Investment Services New Zealand has been fined $80,000 plus costs after pleading guilty to running the ads about Bonus Bonds. The campaign during November and December 2006 implied that the winner would receive $1 million and a holiday home, when they were actually going into a second draw for a chance at winning those prizes.
