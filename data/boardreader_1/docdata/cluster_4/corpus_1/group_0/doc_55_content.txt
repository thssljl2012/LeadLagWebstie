 Owen Hargreaves has called on Manchester City Council to ensure there is no repeat of the fiasco which prevented Manchester United showing off the Champions League trophy in May. United were denied the opportunity to parade the European Cup and Barclays Premier League crown immediately after their shoot-out victory over Chelsea. Scroll down for moreDisappointing: Owen Hargreaves (far left) was upset that Manchester United didn't get to parade the Champions League trophy in their home city after lifting it in Moscow.The local authority decided against sanctioning a celebration due to the trouble which erupted around Rangers' visit to the city for the UEFA Cup Final a week earlier. Instead, the Red Devils will embark on an extended lap of honour with the cups ahead of the friendly with Juventus at Old Trafford on August 6. More...   Hargreaves is looking forward to the occasion but feels it is wrong the club have been forced to wait over two months to officially mark their twin achievements. 'This is a belated opportunity for the fans to see the cups because obviously we did not have a celebration afterwards,' said the England international. 'However, it really is something that should have been done as soon as we came back. 'Everyone was disappointed it did not happen - the players, the staff and the fans. 'Trophies such as that are the culmination of so much hard work. It doesn't happen very often, so it is a shame something could not be set up. 'It is something that needs to be looked at because Manchester United could not be blamed for what happened at the UEFA Cup Final.'
