The campaign, created by Dare, aims to educate consumers about the personal overdraft facility, which is designed to tide customers over in the event of unforeseen emergencies.The campaign includes a website with a series of humorous films in which a character called Sam explains how Personal Reserve works.Throughout his week, Sam is beset by numerous misfortunate events, including having his car clamped, dropping his phone in a glass of water and accidentally ripping his shower off the wall.The online activity is supported by banner advertising and a mailing campaign which will go out to 11m customers. It has just gone live in preparation for the product launch on 18 August. Related stories
