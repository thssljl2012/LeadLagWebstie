 Australian rower James Chapman has dreamt of representing his country at the Olympics ever since he was a young child.In his junior years he envisioned success in track and field - either in the running or high jump events.But since having later discovered his rowing talents, the former schoolboys Head of the River-winner has always sought Olympic success on water.Chapman travelled to the 2004 Athens Olympics as a reserve, but will head to the Beijing Games as a fully fledged member of Australia's men's eight.He overcame the disappointment on missing out on a berth four years ago with successes at the King's Cup (2004, 2008), and finished fourth at the 2006 world championships in his first campaign with the men's eight.In 2007 Chapman failed in his bid to qualify for the Olympics with the men's four, but was such a strong performer that his inclusion in the first-choice eight was considered essential to Australia's chances of winning a medal in Beijing.Chapman's focus away from the Olympics is on his business career - he is currently working at Westpac Bank as a corporate analyst and business developer.
