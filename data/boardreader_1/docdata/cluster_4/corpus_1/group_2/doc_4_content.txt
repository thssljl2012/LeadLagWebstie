Brazil striker Ronaldo has again claimed he is in talks with Manchester City and believes it is a 'big possibility' he could soon be playing in the Barclays Premier League.The out-of-contract 31-year-old reckons he is within two to three months of a return to competitive action after being sidelined since February with a knee-ligament injury.'It is a big possibility,' he told French daily L'Equipe. 'Manchester City are in the process of putting in place an unbelievable project, with some great players. We are in the process of talking to them. So we will see.'The Brazilian, who believes his recovery from his knee injury is going 'marvellously well', has played down fears about his fitness.'People can say what they want,' he added. 'Let's just say I am above my usual weight, but that is normal. That isn't surprising - I have gone five months without training.'There is nothing illogical about putting on a few kilos. They can say what they want, it doesn't bother me.'I am going to continue to work hard and to look to reach my goal, to get back playing football. Like before.'Editor's ChoiceIf you've just returned from a holiday from hell with your other half, going away with a large group could be the way forward.The most progressive, sustainable community in the country opened its doors yesterday and The Argus was there to have a nose around.The Argus has teamed up with Jack Daniels for you and a friend to win tickets to travel to the US for the ultimate birthday celebration.Two high-profile stabbings in Sussex in the past week have raised concerns that knife crime is becoming more prevalent than ever.
