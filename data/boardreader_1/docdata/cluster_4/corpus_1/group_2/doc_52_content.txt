Just three days after crushing Portsmouth 6-0 in the Barclays Premier League, City were dumped out of the Carling Cup by Coca-Cola League One Brighton.And after last night's penalty shoot-out defeat to a side beaten at home by nine-man Walsall at the weekend, Manchester United boss Ferguson had a warning for his big-spending rivals. He explained: 'It's all very well having all the money but you can't buy everyone. It was proved in the summer. 'We didn't want to sell Ronaldo, other clubs don't want to sell their best players, and there are only so many players you can buy.' The Old Trafford boss, who has clocked up 21 years as United manager, told the club's official magazine, Inside United: 'Back in the 1950's Sunderland were called 'The Bank of England Team' - and they got relegated. There are no guarantees. 'You can buy 11 individuals - you can buy 11 Robinhos but it wouldn't be a team would it? 'The art of management is building a team with balance, with certain characteristics that blend with each other - that's the most important thing.' City manager Mark Hughes, who played under Ferguson at Old Trafford, has been promised time to achieve success by City's hugely wealthy new owners from Abu Dhabi.But Ferguson added: 'Mark Hughes will be faced with that situation having all this money and wondering what to do with it, and that can put you under a bit of additional pressure.'
