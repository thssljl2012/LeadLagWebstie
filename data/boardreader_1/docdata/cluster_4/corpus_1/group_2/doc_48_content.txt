West Ham 2(Barclays Premier League)WEST HAM put a disastrous week both on and off the pitch behind them with a nail-biting win over 10-man Fulham.After being hit by a whopping 30million bill by an independent tribunal and being knocked out of the Carling Cup by Watford in mid-week, Gianfranco Zola's men provided a perfect riposte as first-half goals from Carlton Cole and Matthew Etherington preserved the Hammers' superb unbeaten Premier League record at Craven Cottage.The Irons have now taken 16 points from a possible 18 at the home of their West London rivals.Cole - visibly boosted by his manager's backing after he was arrested for drink-driving in the week  opened the scoring with a close-range strike before Etherington doubled their advantage in a frenetic finale to the first-half, which also saw Fulham striker Andy Johnson sent off for a second yellow card.Fulham enjoyed the lion's share of possession and chances but it was West Ham who found their shooting boots to open up a healthy two-goal lead in the first period.Former West Ham player Paul Konchesky was left to rue his rash challenge on his old club mate Etherington as the left winger dusted himself off to put the boot in to Fulham.After receiving several minutes of treatment on the sidelines it seemed Etherington would join Konchesky in Andre Marriner's book as he sought retribution by clattering Andy Johnson.But he quickly began channeling his aggression in the most effective way as he first laid on Cole for the opener before doubling the Hammers' lead on the stroke of half-time.Cole's flick in the 43rd minute sent Etherington galloping down the right flank and the winger took the ball to the by-line before firing a low cross into the box. Mark Schwarzer in the Fulham goal got his fingertips to the ball but it fell into the path of Cole, who was left the simplest of tasks to finish from two yards.Just two minutes later Etherington raced on to a lofted pass from Mark Noble and he beat the off-side trap and the on-rushing Schwarzer to the ball, poking it past him into the unguarded net.In a frantic last few minutes, Andy Johnson was given his marching orders by Marriner after the referee adjudged his high challenge to be worthy of a second yellow card.While the Hammers had scored against the run of play in the first period, it was Fulham's turn in the second half as they halved the deficit with a Danny Murphy penalty.Schwarzer had pulled off two terrific saves from Herita Ilunga and Noble as his side were put under the cosh but the Cottagers were awarded a penalty when Irons' skipper Lucas Neill handled the ball in the area, allowing Murphy to step up and send Robert Green the wrong way. Substitute Craig Bellamy was guilty of missing when it seemed easier to score as he blasted his effort over the bar after good work down the left from Ilunga.Cole had his shot blocked on the line and Valon Behrami had an effort saved by Schwarzer as the Hammers found acres of space behind the Fulham backline.But two goals were enough in the end as Zola made it two wins from two in the league under his reign.
