Britain defeat USA in medal matchMilton Keynes' Andy Blake played a successful cameo role in his swansong appearance as Team GB overcame the odds to land Paralympic wheelchair basketball bronze against USA on Tuesday.Blake, who came off the bench at the death to score three points and consolidate Great Britain's 85-77 win in Beijing, immediately dedicated the victory to the squad's head coach Murray Treseder.The no-nonsense Aussie was forced to return to his homeland last week during the group stages after a long-standing medical condition flared up in the Far East.But Team GB never looked like capitulating in the play-off as Terry Bywater, who top scored with 32 points, hit a basket on the buzzer at the end of the third period as GB outscored America 24-11 to open up a 14-point advantage.And despite a brief US comeback in the final quarter, Britain ran out comfortable winners.Blake, who first won gold as a swimmer at the 1988 Seoul Games, helped GB cruise into the semi-final stages with wins over China, USA, Brazil and Israel.They then went on to knock-out Germany 74-61 in Saturday's quarter-final before losing to Australia in front of more than 12,000 fans in the semi-final.'I'm so proud of all the players,' said Blake.'It has been a hectic week but we've shown grit and determination to come through and win bronze.'There's no better way to go out than winning a medal. It's simply electric.'It doesn't quite hit you until the medal is around your neck.'It feels good for the team and for the effort everyone has put in through these last two weeks.'In 2006 we fell out of the world's top four. When we get into the gym and break sweat, blister and bleed, we want to get on the medal podium, hear national anthems, and be part of the best.'Blake has now called time on his international career, the highlight of which was captaining GB to bronze for year's ago in Athens.'You'll never see this group of 12 again,' he added. Obviously I'm retiring and I think that emotion pulled me through in the end.Lloyds TSB, proud first partner of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and supporter of ParalympicsGB on their journey to 2012.
