Missing out this time: Fabio Aurelio (left) misses Liverpool's trip to Marseille although there is a possibility Fernando Torres could be on the bench Photo: Reuters The former Valencia defender sustained a calf injury during his side's 2-1 win over Manchester United on Saturday. Aurelio's absence is not thought to be serious and the club have reassured fans by describing it as a 'minor' injury. However, Argentine midfielder Javier Mascherano is expected to have recovered from a knee injury, while both Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres are in the travelling party. Gerrard, recovered from a groin operation, is expected to start the game but there is a possibility that Torres will be on the bench after his hamstring problem. Brazilian Lucas, who missed out on Saturday's Barclays Premier League win because he had not arrived back from international duty, is also in the squad - but David Ngog has also been left out. Manager Rafael Benitez is hoping for a repeat of last year's 4-0 victory in the group stages, but he is not underestimating the French team. He said: 'They are playing well, winning games and scoring goals. It will be tough and they are a good team, but we are playing well at the moment.' Liverpool squad: Reina, Cavalieri, Arbeloa, Degen, Carragher, Skrtel, Agger, Dossena, Mascherano, Alonso, Gerrard, Benayoun, Babel, Lucas, Riera, Kuyt, Torres, Keane.
