Darren Bent insists the man-management skills of new Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp have quashed the discontent which set in during Juande Ramos' failed regime.  Spurs climbed off the foot of the Barclays Premier League with Saturday's thrilling 2-1 victory over Liverpool, making it seven points from three matches under Redknapp.  Appointing the former Portsmouth manager is proving an inspired move by the W  hite Hart Lane board who could only have dreamed of such a stunning revival.  Bent has revealed that Redknapp inherited a squad tainted by unrest and bereft of confidence, yet changed the mood instantly with an inclusive approach which restored self-belief.  And in a damning indictment of the language barrier under Spaniard Ramos, Bent has revealed that Redknapp's communication skills has sent morale soaring.  'At one stage the training ground was a horrible place to be,' he said.  'Everyone was down but since Harry has come in everyone has had a new lease of life. That has shown in the performances.  'It wasn't nice before. Ramos came in and banished a lot of players to the reserves because he didn't want them.  'But Harry has made everyone feel welcome and that's the respect you've got to show people.  'If you show them that respect, they will do what we've done on the pitch and get results.  'I never really got to know Ramos.
