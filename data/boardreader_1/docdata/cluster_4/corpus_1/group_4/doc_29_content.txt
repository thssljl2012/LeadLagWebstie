ASTON Villa manager Martin O'Neill has branded England's forthcoming friendly international in Germany as 'meaningless and pointless' even though striker Gabriel Agbonlahor is hotly tipped to earn a call-up from Fabio Capello.  O'Neill is perplexed about the timing of the match in Berlin next Wednesday given the current heavy domestic and European schedule and with no World Cup qualifiers scheduled until the end of March. He believes players would benefit more from having a rare midweek rest and is fearful of the burn-out factor ahead of today's Barclays Premier League trip to Arsenal. 'My feelings are not mixed. I think it (the internationals) are pointless, not just the England game but all of them next week,' he said. 'We'll be interrupting cup finals soon for another stab at a friendly game.'I know people say the England manager is going to experiment but I wouldn't accept it was a really good idea simply because Gabby (Agbonlahor) or Ashley (Young) might get a call-up.'
