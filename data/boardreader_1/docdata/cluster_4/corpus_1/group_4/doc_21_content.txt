Benitez has made it clear he is anxious for an early resolution to contract negotiations he hopes will secure his long-term future as Liverpool manager. The Spaniard, who is plotting Liverpool's bid for the Barclays Premier League title, believes sorting out his own future will also go a long way to boosting confidence.  "I want the contract done quickly, because the team is playing well," said Benitez.  "I do not want to be talking about this for weeks and months.  "The team is very strong - you can see the progress. There is a new stadium soon, and I want to be part of the future of Liverpool.  "The length of the contract is important to me. We have been improving the squad for five years - so clearly we know that in the future we can be contenders and we can win more trophies."  When a potential five-year contract was suggested, Benitez said: "That would be very good.  "We will have to see, but I would like to be here for a very long time.  "We must do it quickly.  week there will be meetings, and I hope it can be sorted soon - certainly not too long.  "I would like to see it signed before the end of the month. The owners have to talk to my agent about the conditions of the deal, but clearly the length of the contract is crucial. Stability is the key to winning trophies and being contenders for the title."Copyright PA  2008, All Rights Reserved  The full article contains 270 words and appears in Press Association newspaper.
