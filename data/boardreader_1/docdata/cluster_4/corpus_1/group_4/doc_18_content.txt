Manchester City midfielder Vincent Kompany remains doubtful for the Barclays Premier League match against Tottenham on Sunday at Eastlands.  Kompany sat out the 3-2 victory over FC Twente in the UEFA Cup last night because of a groin problem.  Benjani is pushing for a place in the starting line-up after marking his return from a thigh injury with a goal.  Provisional squad: Hart, Schmeichel, Zabaleta, Onuoha, Richards, Dunne, Ben Haim, Garrido, Ball, Wright-Phillips, Ireland, Kompany, Elano, Robinho, Jo, Benjani, Vassell, Fernandes, Hamann, Evans, Sturridge.
