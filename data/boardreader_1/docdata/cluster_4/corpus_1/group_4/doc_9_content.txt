 Chelsea rewrote the history books as Nicolas Anelka continued his prolific goal form to take them back to the top of the Barclays Premier League with a 3-0 win at West Brom. Luis Felipe Scolari's side equalled the 47-year-old record of Tottenham in achieving a 10th successive top-flight away win and surpassed their own previous best Premier League run away from Stamford Bridge from four years ago. Anelka's double took his own tally to 12 League goals for the campaign - and eight in the last four games - after Jose Bosingwa had broken the deadlock for the Blues.
