Jermain Defoe handed Tony Adams his first victory as Portsmouth boss in a dramatic finish at Sunderland.  The England striker converted an injury-time penalty to snatch all three points after the Black Cats had failed to make the most of a host of opportunities,  Algerian midfielder Nadir Belhadj had earlier blasted a 51st-minute shot past keeper Marton Fulop to cancel out Djibril Cisse's opener just four minutes into the game.  Sunderland have now record only one win in seven Barclays Premier League games, while for the visitors, the victory was their first in all competitions in six.
