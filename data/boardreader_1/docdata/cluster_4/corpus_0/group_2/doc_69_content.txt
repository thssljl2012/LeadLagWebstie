Manchester City's England Under 21 international midfielder Michael Johnson has this evening put pen-to-paper on a new five-year contract with the Club.The deal ends months ofspeculation surrounding the talented Urmston-born Academy graduate who has committed his future to City with a contract that runs until 2013.Michael broke into the City first team under Stuart Pearce, making his debut in a heavy defeat at Wigan back in October 2006, and became the 20th player to progress from Platt Lane to the Blues' first team in the process.It was a better experience the second time around as Johnson impressed in what proved to be a vital 2-0 away win at Middlesbrough in March 2007.The 20-year-old has since attracted interest from many fellow Barclays Premier League clubs, but this is another statement of intent by both Mark Hughes and the Club as they have secured the future of another internationally recognisedyoung player.Leon Collins
