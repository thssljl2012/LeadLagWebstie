Keane, police car^ my notes, so I would remember when I got back here after a round of msn.Well we'll start with Keane. I found out that Keane were coming to the Brighton Centre and I like Keane, but I couldn't think of any friends who would want to or be able to come, but I knew my brother liked them, so i inquired and now we are going. It's on the 10th of February.Last night I walked home, as I did this evening. Well last night it was like half 10 at night, got to the Old Shoreham Road, Nevill Rd, Sackville Rd Junction. So crossed to the middle (cba to say which one I was at :P) And you know there are 2 sets of lights for the section, the right turns then the straight ahead and the left turns. Well it was green for the right turns and nothing was there, which meant I could cross. There was a police car waiting to go at the next light change. I looked at the lights again to make sure that the lights weren't turning, as that'd send cars into me, it was still green, so I started to cross. Then I looked at the cars again and this police car had decided it didn't wanna wait and would go right after all, i.e. heading right towards me. I stepped back to preserve my life.
