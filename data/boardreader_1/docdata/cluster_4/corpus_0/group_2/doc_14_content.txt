Roman conqueror! Roman Pavlyuchenko is delighted to have opened his Spurs goalscoring account and hopes the team can now build on our midweek victory.   Juande Ramos' side go into Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Portsmouth having booked a place in the fourth round of the Carling Cup with a 2-1 win over Newcastle. Roman opened the scoring at St James' Park on the night and found the net for the first time since arriving at The Lane from Spartak Moscow in the summer. And the big Russian could barely hide his delight at getting onto the scoresheet just three games into his career in English football. &amp;quot;I'm very pleased,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I've been waiting to score a goal and I was very pleased for the team that I was able to score this goal. &amp;quot;I didn't score in either of my first two games and thoughts started to enter my mind that I needed a goal to boost my confidence. &amp;quot;I think the Newcastle result should give us confidence as a team for the upcoming games and we should only be thinking about going forwards from here.&amp;quot; Tottenhamhotspur.com - News Articles - Roman conqueror!
