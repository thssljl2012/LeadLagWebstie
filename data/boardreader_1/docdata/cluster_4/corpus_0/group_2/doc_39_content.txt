Chew on these statistics:  Camilo Villegas:  M/C at Barclays T-3 at Deutsche Bank 1st at BMW 1st at Tour Championship  Vijay Singh  1st at Barclays 1st at Deutsche Bank T-44 at BMW T-22 at Tour Championship  Somehow, I think that an M/C and a T-3 are worth more than Vijay&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;other&amp;#8221; finishes.  Way to go, PGA Tour.  Nice job with the FedEx Cup point distribution.  Methinks a freshman stats student might have come up with a better formula.
