No fanfare.. no stars&amp;#8230; hush&amp;#8230; hush in the last page of news papers. The National Football league, in its new avatar; I -league is here. This is the second edition of an obscure football league in India where obscure foreign players ply their trade. Brazilians, Africans and such goes the ethnic backgrounds of these players.

The Mumbai outfits Mumbai FC and Mahindra United, the Goan contingent that include Dempo, Churchill Brothers and sorts and the sole representation from the North JCT Mills. A SWOT analysis done here weigh up all the teams in this edition of i-league. With matches conducted over the weekends, I-league expect to increase its viewer ship. Last time for many matches, tickets were not issued;such was the turn out, hardly hundreds.

The AFC Challenge Cup victory against a formidable Tajikistan has been a real morale booster for everyone who follows Indian football and then Dempo&amp;#8217;s forced themselves in to the semi-finals of the AFC Cup . Tremendous so far with other notable achievements being the Indian  U-16 team&amp;#8217;s, who held Manchester United for a draw in the UK tour.
