Last Friday's Critical Mass incident is still in the news. It made the front page of the local section of the Seattle Times today. Apparently the&amp;nbsp;horrible relationship between drivers and cyclists in this city&amp;nbsp;is such a hot button that it still sells papers 5 days after the event, even without any new developments. The paper does a decent job of trying to represent both sides. Or at least, I can tell that they're slightly&amp;nbsp;less biased than I am.&amp;nbsp;  I've been a long-time supporter of the Cascade Bicycle Alliance (CBA), a local&amp;nbsp;organization that successfully&amp;nbsp;furthers productive bicycle-centric programs and acts as a political lobby to represent the voices of the two-wheeled community. CBA released a public statement today condemming last Friday's incident and&amp;nbsp;is organizing a meeting between bicycle community representatives, law enforcement, and public policy makers to discuss and moderate the issue. This is totally exciting to me! I want to be at that meeting! Feathers are going to fly, for sure, but I want to be part of the solution to this&amp;nbsp;shitty situation. We can fix this! Hell, I'm so overcome right now&amp;nbsp;that I &amp;nbsp;might go out and hug a car driver today.  Here's a link to the CBA Press Release: http://www.cascade.org/Advocacy/pdf/cbc-cm_statement_07-28-08.pdf They&amp;nbsp;haven't made&amp;nbsp;the location and time of this meeting public, but I'm going to send out a few emails to find out if I can't track it down. I'm hoping for a spot in the peanut gallery.  Here's a link to the Seattle Times article: http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008078611_criticalmass29m.html
