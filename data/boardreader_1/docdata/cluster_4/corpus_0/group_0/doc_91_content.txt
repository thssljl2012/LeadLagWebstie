 I hope you're proud of yourself.&amp;nbsp; I know I did a stupid thing by spacing and walking away without collecting my card and ending my session.&amp;nbsp; But you, instead of doing the right thing, decided to commit a crime.&amp;nbsp; You pressed the&amp;nbsp;"yes" button when&amp;nbsp;the machine asked if I would like another&amp;nbsp;transaction.&amp;nbsp;You then&amp;nbsp;proceeded to withdraw almost $300&amp;nbsp;from my account.&amp;nbsp; I want&amp;nbsp;you to know that I have filed a&amp;nbsp;police report and will be getting my money back.&amp;nbsp; With the ATM surveillance tape, I hope&amp;nbsp;they catch your sorry ass.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime,&amp;nbsp;enjoy your $260 shopping spree&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;Bank of America's dime.No love,&amp;nbsp;K&amp;nbsp;
