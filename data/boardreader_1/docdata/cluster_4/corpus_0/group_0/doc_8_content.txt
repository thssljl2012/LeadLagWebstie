 I'm a college student about to separate my finances from my parents', and I'd like to be able to track them on my Mac, so I'm looking for personal finance software.My finances are relatively simple: a Checking account, a Savings account, and no stocks yet, though I'm contemplating investing, etc.) and I use Bank of America.Searching google and this community came up with three candidates:Quicken for Mac 2007 iBank and GnuCashDoes anyone have any direct experience with any of these three programs?
