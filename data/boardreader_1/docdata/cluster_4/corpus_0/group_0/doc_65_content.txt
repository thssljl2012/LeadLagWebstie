I finally got a chance to check it out and I was duly impressed. It seems to be designed to support the BlackBerry which is pretty cool. From the website you have access to:  My Accounts: View current account balances. Account Details: View recent transactions on Electric Orange, Orange Savings Accounts and Orange Home Equity accounts. Transfer Money: Transfer money into and out of your ING DIRECT accounts. Remember, internal transfers made between ING DIRECT accounts occur immediately and transfer to and from external linked accounts take 2-3 business days. Electric Orange Payment Details: View payment details for recent payments. Changes or additions to Payments cannot be made through Orange Mobile.  If you have an ING account check it out at www.ingdirect.com/m
