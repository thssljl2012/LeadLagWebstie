In addition to the Charlotte Observer shilling for his campaign, McCrory also has the inside track with the Charlotte Bidness Journal, who wrote this story a couple of months ago: It all started with a call to Kenneth Lewis.  Pat McCrory, two months past his successful run for a seventh term as mayor, wanted to gauge the support from Charlotte's corporate community as he pondered a campaign for governor. So he went to the top. Lewis, the Bank of America Corp. chairman and chief executive, told McCrory that he was on board. "If I was going to run, I thought it would look bad to be mayor of Charlotte and not have the local business community behind me," McCrory says, remembering that January phone call. Soon after McCrory entered the race, Lewis and Duke Energy Carolinas President Ellen Ruff led a February fund-raiser for him, hauling in more than $400,000. "I'm getting incredible support from Charlotte, from the business community," McCrory says.  Just in case anyone has any confusion about who McCrory answers to.  And who could be a more reliable guide than a CEO whose rudderless company recently suffered $3.6 billion in credit losses?
