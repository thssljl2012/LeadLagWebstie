 Note to self (and I guess all of you too):Although Catchphrase is a fun party game, playing it til 4:30 in the morning is a little excessive, even when there are drinks and cake involved! I guess some things about birthday parties don't change (the game playing, obviously not the 4:30 am part ;)In other randomness my Bank of America ATM now counts my money for me and scans lil pictures of the checks and puts it on my receipt. This would be a really cool feature except that it takes MUCH longer to deposit money. Don't get me wrong, I still thought it was cool enough to warrant calling Andrew to tell him about it (though he wasn't as impressed as i was). Ok, its time for some serious coffee making!
