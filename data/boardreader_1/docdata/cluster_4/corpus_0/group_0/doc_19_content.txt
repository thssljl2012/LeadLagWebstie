 From today's Daily Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/06/30/cnvisa130.xml):Lloyds TSB gives Visa cards to 11-year-oldsA leading bank is giving children as young as 11 debit cards without informing their parents, it has emerged.The bank receives a fee from the retailer every time a card is used. In the past, children aged 11 to 15 with current accounts could only have debit cards that could be used only in cash machines or at bank branches.A spokesman for Lloyds TSB said: "We wrote to customers under the age of 16, who previously had a cash machine card, to let them know they could have a debit card.I used to have one of these cards before I closed my Lloyds TSB current account after a fee increase.http://digital-lifestyles.info/2008/06/30/lloyds-tsb-visa-debit-cards-for-kids-used-to-buy-pr0n-fags-booze-etc/ adds:"A gloriously naive Lloyds TSB claimed that they wrote to their cashcard-holding customers under the age of 16 to let them know they could have a debit card but made it clear that they should let their parents know - like thats going to work!"
