CHRISTINA KIM: Today was just personally quite a struggle I  thought actually. Yesterday&amp;#8217;s round just seemed to happened it seamlessly. I  just kind of would just blink and the ball would fall in. Today it seemed  like the combination of slightly more difficult pins along with knowing that I  shot 9 under, which is always hard to follow up on. Once you start shooting  those 5, 6, 7, , 8, 9, so on and so forth, it&amp;#8217;s hard to back them up. I just  hung in there and only had one bogey in 36 holes. I&amp;#8217;m quite pleased with  that. Q. You said yesterday was kind of seamless. I think you  said after the third hole yesterday. Some days are like that and some days are  like today where you feel like you&amp;#8217;ve had to earn everything.   CHRISTINA KIM: Absolutely. Yeah, like I said, yesterday I just  seemed like I farted and a birdie came, you know. No effort it seemed. It&amp;#8217;s been  I mean, honestly, I haven&amp;#8217;t had a round that low. I&amp;#8217;ve probably had a 64 once in  the last three years. It just seemed really hard to even get to one of those  scores, let alone have a chance to back it up. I was watching the leaderboard  and seeing Sherri Turner come in at 12 under first thing in the morning. You  know that yesterday wasn&amp;#8217;t necessary just a fluke in terms of condition of golf  course. You knew people were going to be throwing darts and there were going  to be some low numbers out there. That added probably a little bit of pressure.  Just the fact that I&amp;#8217;m in this position again after years and years and years it  seems. It&amp;#8217;s just great to be back here. Keep reading&amp;#8230;.
