Although these groups are barred from soliciting money for presidential candidates, the association is telling prospective contributors that money for the association will ultimately help out McCain at the top of the ticket. Of course the association&amp;#8217;s fund is getting cash from big corporations like Pfizer, Bank of America Corp. and Travelers, which have given $150,000 or more. But that&amp;#8217;s not the main target of this fundraising effort. [WSJ:] &amp;#8220;Rather, the pitch is aimed at individuals, including many top contributors to the controversial Swift Boat group that targeted Sen. Kerry. Texas developer Bob Perry, the largest financial backer of the Swift Boat group, also is the largest individual donor to the governors group, at $250,000. Carl Lindner, a retired insurance executive in Ohio and another top Swift Boat financier, has contributed $100,000 to the governors&amp;#8217; fund. The campaign-finance lawyer for the Swift Boat group in 2004 now serves the same role for the governors association. The McCain campaign and the individual contributors all declined to comment on their involvement.&amp;#8221;Yet the whole situation is dubiously legal. In 2005 the Federal Election Commission banned such groups from soliciting donations by pledging help to a federal candidate. Even the McCain camp questions the pitch tactics. &amp;#8220;If it is in fact telling its donors their money will help elect McCain they are being inaccurate,&amp;#8221; said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers, told the Journal, noting the group cannot legally attempt to sway a federal race. But he said that because he had not yet seen evidence the group is campaigning on Sen. McCain&amp;#8217;s behalf, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not an issue.&amp;#8221; And, in a further non-issue, John McCain&amp;#8217;s fixer in dealing with his Wesley Clark problem (and, previously, his broken wife problem) is none other than SBVFT Bud Day. That&amp;#8217;s straight talk I can believe in!
