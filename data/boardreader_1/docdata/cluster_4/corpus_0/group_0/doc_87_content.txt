 The last couple of days have gone by quite fast, so I hope the next couple of weeks go the same way. I hate imposing on my aunt! But also, I want to get the first 2 weeks at teh new job out of the way. They're always the hardest. Plus I'm officially broke and Informa don't pay me until next Monday lol  Wait, I cba to post anymore right now....
