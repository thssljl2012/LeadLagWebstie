 I've got Gareth and Alasdair comming round before they go to Europe for a month. Alasdair moved to OZ 2 years ago so its nice to see him again and Gaz lives round the corner hence why I never see him as he lives far to close! XD&amp;nbsp;I guess we are going to end up going into town or playing Rock Band seeing as people are comming round just to play on it. I am rather good at the guitar now..even if I dont like it and expert is just a lil challange for me now I just cba doing the solo mode as its so lame to play songs I don't nkow or like. I can now play the drums on medium and working on hard (a few songs but not all) and singing well...singing is odd as frist time I got 100% which pissed me off so I am just not playing the singing as it's not fun because I can do it and there is no challange in it..unless I don't know the words to the song in which case why the hell would I want to sing it. I still pulling for GH as it's just that little bit better and little bit harder and I don't worry that the guitars will break halfway through a song. Oh and the blisters on my hands from playing so much are going now but I still sometimes get them from playing Halo 3 for days on end...so sad.I rather miss Zoe still and won't get to see her today =( and I missin Holly and Alex nearly just as much. I should get to see her soon and well my rents are going away on friday so after that Zoe can come live here for the week if she wants...that said I do want to see her before then.I have booked my driving theory test. It is in 2 weeks and I cba studying. I passed the CD a few times but I reckon its pot luck and I think in the exam situation the added pressure will help me (as I work best under pressure) or I will just go 'OH SHIT!' and fail...I am praying the latter does not happen.I am currently typing 120 words PM which I didnt think was to bad for a dyslexic kid =)
