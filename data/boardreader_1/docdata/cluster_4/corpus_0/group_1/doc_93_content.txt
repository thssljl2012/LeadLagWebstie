 Going to see Hair in Central Park, watching the cast pull audience members onto the stage for a final reprise of Let the Sunshine In and actually deciding not to be cynical about it and join in - only to be stopped by security because too many people were on stage.The opening shill for Bank of America was also a teensy bit pathetic. Watching the show now is a bit like watching Rent now - when I managed to take it in its original context, I enjoyed it, but overall that is a difficult thing to do.
