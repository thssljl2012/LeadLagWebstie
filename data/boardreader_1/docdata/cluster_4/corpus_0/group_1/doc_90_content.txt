I recently moved to an apartment in East Harlem, a decision I made because of its proximity to the Bronx (where I&amp;#8217;ll be working) but also its relative accessibility to the rest of Manhattan.

My roommates and I were thrilled with our apartment because it&amp;#8217;s a block away from the 6 train, a couple blocks from the 2 and the 3, and very cheap. There&amp;#8217;s a 24-hour laundromat next door and a grocery store a few doors down. Just a few blocks away is a Bank of America and a CVS. There were other vacancies in our building so we recommended that other friends of ours who were looking for an apartment to come and take a look. Unfortunately, something about visiting our neighborhood at night led our other friends to believe that the neighborhood was &amp;#8220;unsafe&amp;#8221;. In fact, they argued that the neighborhood was one of the &amp;#8220;most dangerous places&amp;#8221; they&amp;#8217;d ever been. Descriptions of roaming gangs and police patrolling in groups of four colored our friends&amp;#8217; descriptions of their experience in our neighborhood. I have been here all hours of the day and have never seen such a thing. Just about the scariest thing I&amp;#8217;ve seen is a little girl holding an ice cream cone as she walked with her parents. Okay, more realistically - maybe the guy sitting outside the laundromat who said, &amp;#8220;Hey sweetie&amp;#8221; as I walked by. Not scary, though. Just obnoxious. Because they&amp;#8217;re my friends, I&amp;#8217;m willing to cut them some slack. I&amp;#8217;m willing to think that either they came here on a bad day or were mistaken about what street we lived on. The only other plausible reason for them believing that this neighborhood was extremely unsafe is that they have a complete distorted view of what &amp;#8220;unsafe&amp;#8221; really means. It makes it seem like they&amp;#8217;ve grown up in cushy, suburban homes surrounded by the warmth and wealth of upper middle class living. And I can&amp;#8217;t say that that&amp;#8217;s not where I came from, but that&amp;#8217;s the point. It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem excusable to me. Instead it just reeks of biases, of racism, of ignorance and naivete. And I don&amp;#8217;t want to think of my friends that way but right now it&amp;#8217;s hard not to. My roommates and I have been brushing it off with jokes - &amp;#8220;Oh my god, the little girl with the ice cream! We have to get out of this neighborhood, it&amp;#8217;s so unsafe!&amp;#8221; but in the back of my head I&amp;#8217;m still cringing from the thought that some of my friends are just on a completely different page than I am. I&amp;#8217;ve also been told that I can&amp;#8217;t work in the Bronx because it&amp;#8217;s too unsafe. I&amp;#8217;ve been told that I can&amp;#8217;t do my job at all - teaching in the inner city - because it&amp;#8217;s too unsafe. I have all of these people from different corners of my life (none of whom know me well, thank god) telling me that I shouldn&amp;#8217;t do what I&amp;#8217;m doing because it&amp;#8217;s unsafe. And their caution hints at the idea that maybe I&amp;#8217;m the stupid one, the ignorant one, the naive one. Little girl in a big city and she doesn&amp;#8217;t know what she&amp;#8217;s getting into, what dark path she&amp;#8217;s walking down. It sucks because nobody tells me these things because they&amp;#8217;re trying to be mean or hurtful, they&amp;#8217;re doing it because they are completely well-intentioned and are trying to &amp;#8220;look out for me&amp;#8221;. So it&amp;#8217;s hard not to do anything else but laugh it off, let it slide off my back (water droplets on duck feathers). But really, at this point - it&amp;#8217;s getting ridiculous. The next time somebody tells me they think they know what &amp;#8220;unsafe&amp;#8221; is for me (and not for them, not admitting to their own fears and biases and racism) I&amp;#8217;m going to give them a piece of my mind or else a punch in the face.
