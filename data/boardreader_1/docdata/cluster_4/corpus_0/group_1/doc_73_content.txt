A friend recently informed me that she had nearly&amp;nbsp;been the victim of a loan scammer.&amp;nbsp; She had been looking for a&amp;nbsp;loan that didn't do any credit checks, hoping to find maybe a private lender.&amp;nbsp; She wandered onto the Gumtree advertising site and saw that there were absolutely lots of adverts offering loans.&amp;nbsp; She applied for one and was accepted, no questions asked.&amp;nbsp; All they required was her name/address and a scanned copy of her driving licence or passport for proof of identity.&amp;nbsp; Warning bells starting to ring though, when, they informed her that the interest rate was only 2% and they required her to send them a fee of &amp;pound;50 by Western Union, which they insisted was just an administration fee.&amp;nbsp; Any company that asks you to send them money by Western Union is not legit..and 2% is somewhat strange!I decided to do some detective work regarding these loan offers on Gumtree.&amp;nbsp; I applied for lots of them and informed them that I was looking for a legit lender who would not require an upfront fee.&amp;nbsp; Most of them ignored me, some replied with quite rude emails saying I was wasting my time and theirs if I wasn't prepared to pay the admin fee.&amp;nbsp; Some gave me telephone numbers which when googled came up on the 419 scam list.But one stood out from the rest, they tried everything under the sun to persuade me to send them &amp;pound;100.&amp;nbsp; They insisted that my loan had been transfered to my bank account but I couldn't touch it until I had sent &amp;pound;100 by Western Union.&amp;nbsp; This was, they said the banks administration charges but the loan company would refund this money to me and they had in fact transfered this amount back to me already.Worse still I had a letter from Barclays Banks using a hotmail email account....unbelievable!!!&amp;nbsp; They said I must send this money immediately so they could complete the loan transfer.&amp;nbsp; There was a telephone number on the Barclays email and on one Sunday I rang it, and a male foreign accent voice just answered &amp;quot;ello&amp;quot;....strange that Barclays Bank was open on a Sunday!!!&amp;nbsp; I didn't send anymore emails but I continued to get emails from them asking why I hadn't sent the money and saying I was holding the loan transfer up.&amp;nbsp; Towards the end their mail was quite aggressive.The frustrating thing is that there is nothing anyone can do about it.&amp;nbsp; Sure enough Gumtree will remove the advert straight away when reported, but they only make new ones with new emails.&amp;nbsp; I wonder how many people do fall for this scam, some people must do or these scammers would not be advertising, they are obviously making a quick buck. Anyway you've been warned!Took a trip to the seaside today, &amp;quot;Sunny Hunny&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;rained like crazy on the journey and we got soaked through just getting off the bus and running over to the toilets.&amp;nbsp; It did eventually stop raining and brighten up a bit so we came out of hiding and proceeded to head for the chip shop.&amp;nbsp; We find a phone on the floor (a very wet phone) so handed that in first, well first of all we rang a number on there under &amp;quot;mum&amp;quot; in the contacts and she informed us it was her sons phone who was on holiday there for a week so she was going to try and find a way of contacting him so he could pick it up from the information centre.&amp;nbsp; She wouldn't stop talking and by the time she'd finished he only had 12p credit left....OoopsWe decided to have our sausage and chip meal in the cafe rather than the grass, wasn't too keen on getting a soggy bum.&amp;nbsp; Went for a really long walk on the beach.&amp;nbsp; It was so windy we felt tired afterwards and my ears were hurting.&amp;nbsp; It was quite chilly too.......DON'T let me get started about the weather...ARGH!! Thank god I didn't wear my shorts!After donuts, icecream, sweets it was time to get back!&amp;nbsp; Roll on Summer! lol
