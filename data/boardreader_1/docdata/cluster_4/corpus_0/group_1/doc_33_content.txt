 Click for larger picture in a new window On a recent Night Walk through Downtown Dunedin, I was struck by the bold colors in this SunTrust sign. By day a bland symbol of American banking dogma, at night, a beacon of color in the black void that is after dark.  Eh? Yeah, anyway, I like the way the colors really pop at night, in the dark. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Now that I think of it, I will have to check out some of the other big banks around here, like Bank Of America, Wachovia, AmSouth, etc., to see if they have signs that POP at night...  ____ If you would like to see more of this area, check out Clearwater Beach Daily Photo, and Clearwater Daily Photo.
