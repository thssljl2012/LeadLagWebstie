Yesterday was fun =DI met Kirshteeeeee in Ipswichhhhhh :]I was her boyfriend, because she was dragging me round shops and I was holding her basket looking uninterested by clothes &amp;amp; beauty products =p I HAD NO MONEY.That bitch let me accidently leave my shampoo with her shopping so she bought it for me =p Lmao. I insult her instead of being grateful =pTHEN SHE BOUGHT ME A STAR NECKLACE.. that ended up breaking later on.. BUT YAY =pAnd then she bought me a vanilla iced latte =p Kirstie spoils me =( haha.PLEASE NOTE.. that I argued with her crap loads everytime she bought me something =pBut she won.. she always does...WE MET JONATHON. Who didn't have a good day at work. =( We drove to felixstowe.. I played on my DS in the back, and was suprised at how quick we got back =p We waited like an hour outside Kirstie's house for Kirstie obviously =p Jon and I talked at first and then he started reading and I got my DS out =p haha. We sat at the clifffffffftops, Jon was in a pick on Chloe mood =( I cut my hair. Kirstie printed us lists of what we all had to take for cromer, the only thing I need to take apparently is waterballoons =p We picked up DAVID.And then we went to the CO OP.And saw PARKER.who was wearing a TIE =pKirstie bought me blue lolly things, and then wouldn't let me buy MYSELF anymore =s lol. We sat at the cliff tops again =pAnd I needed to pee lots.. I said something like "I need to squeeze my legs tight so&amp;nbsp;theres no leakage" lmao and the boys were DISGUSTED. Dinosaur Dave went to tickle me so I'd pee myself and I dont think Ive ever shouted fuck off so loud before =o lol. he got told!Then me and Kirstie were discussing someone having a fishy minge lol and then David said we were more vulgar than usual =p Then me and Kirstie discussed our boobs and the boys listened&amp;nbsp;EAGARLY. =p cos they're PERVES.Then we drove for a bit.And listened to jumping all over the world. =pAnd then we listened to when you were young and me and Kirstie were singing in a loud deep opera kinda voice =p I dont think I'll be able to ever sing that song normally now =pWe waited outside the co op for parker to come out =p he had a wall-e&amp;nbsp;thing =p that HAD EVERYTHING. i was amused by the little wall-e stickers =p i stuck them over me, kirstie and parker :] Jon drove us to tescos.. me and Kirstie were singing loud.. and Kirstie gave my chewing gum box a personality, he had a MWAHAHAHA laugh that made his head break lmao. and then she took his clothes off. Kirstie is 19 years old by the way =pWE GOT TO TESCOOOOOOOOS.And food shopping was fun. although I cba to type about it..&amp;nbsp; cos we pretty much just went down aisles and picked out food, like normal food shopping =pfate fell short this time, your smile fades in the summer. place your hand in mine, i'll leave when i wanna.yeah.paying for all of it was awkward =p Parker did some calculations in my book lmao.I dunno really.We drove back.And sat at the clifftops. and did fuck all as always.So yes.I had such a weird realistic dream though =( I keep getting em and I wake up with such a strange feeling.. ohhhhhh I also woke up at 3am and couldn't fall back to sleep =p so I was knackered at work today.. fucking all day =( it killed me! I also felt really ill in the morning. Matt reckoned it was from ALL THOSE LOLLIES I HAD BEFORE I WENT TO BED lmao cos I still had a blue tongue at work =pI didn't wear my shoes at all at work today xDI had such an overdramatic moment running from one side to the store to the other screaming "MATTHEW DON'T GOOOOOO WITHOUT ME NOOOOO!" and then he said "I've never had anyone run after me like that before" haha.And I asked matt to marry me =p but he didn't answer =( lmao.This customer asked me how much her pic n mic went up to and I FOR SOME REASON said "130" and then she looked so suprised =p and I was like "Oh sorry I meant 1.30" and that whole moment amused me so much =sAnd then I bent over to pick up a basket and an old man blew a raspberry and I was SO confused by that lmfao! you dont expect old men to be so CHEEKY =pi got me the NINTENDO magazine to read on my lunch.. fucking animal crossings is gunna be on wii! BE EXCITED PEOPLE!I can't remember what else happened that mademe laugh =sBut yeah. In the last two hours I was so exhausted that I started to mess up loads, like I put in that this man bought 100 worth of lottery tickets =p it took me so fucking long to walk home because my feet hurt so much. I really cba for tomorrow...four hours of probably NOTHING at woolies, and I gotta pack still.. I started but it made me feel overwhelmed =sMy feet acheeeeeeeCharlotte lent me dvds I think I may go watch them now :] Im a cool dude on a saturday night :]
