 The Chief Justice of Canada addresses the CBA CouncilThis year's summer conference for the Canadian Bar Association is being held in Quebec City. The meetings generally get some media attention. Serious work and decisions are made but the most significant impact of the conference is the hallway meetings amongst lawyers from across the country. These hallway meetings strengthen the bonds of amity across Canada and this is important for nation unity. Seeing that, for example, lawyers in British Columbia face the same issues as lawyers in Quebec or Manitoba cannot help but build an ever closer union of Canadians.
