The site is relaunching a new design today with enhanced financial features and educational tools. Mint.com Features Some of the new features that Mint.com has added since launching last September includes budgeting tools, brokerage/investment accounts, mortgage accounts, student loans, and auto loans. Mint.com is also launching How-To guides, where experts give advice on planning retirement, paying student loans, buying a car, creating a personal budget, etc. One of the best features Mint.com offers is monitoring the APR on your credit cards and providing suggestions on ways to save money. Personally I&amp;#8217;d like to find out more information about credit cards that offer 0% APR until a certain month. I just switched to a Bank of America credit card for 0%, but not based on Mint.com&amp;#8217;s recommendation. I actually received the information about the Bank of America 0% APR credit card from a pamphlet in the mail. The purpose of Mint.com&amp;#8217;s new design is that it those looking for a specific financial purpose find it right on the homepage. Notice the retirement, student loan, buying a car, and paying off debtat the bottom? Who doesn&amp;#8217;t want to do that? According to Mashable, Mint.commade double-digit growthwhen adding the new look in turning visitors into members.   The new Mint.com looks pretty cool. I haven&amp;#8217;t played around with Mint in a while, but I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll get into it when I have money lying around in many different accounts. Mint.com hasabout $17 million in funding.               ...
