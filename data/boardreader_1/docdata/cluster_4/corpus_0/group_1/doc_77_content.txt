 Last night I met up with some Austinites in WP. &amp;nbsp;Told them to tell the cabbie North Ave, Milwaukee, &amp; Damen and to meet by the Bank of America (formerly known as Filter). &amp;nbsp;Couldn't really meet on the corner b/c of the drum circle with patchouli and all. &amp;nbsp;And it wasn't just a drum they were beating on. &amp;nbsp;The performance also included the sounds of sticks hitting an OLD TV. &amp;nbsp;By 3AM, they were definitely gone.
