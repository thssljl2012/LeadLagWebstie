 So. It's summer, it's hot, it's muggy, it's 10:44 pm on Saturday, and like the old married fogey I am, sitting in front of this flat screen rewatching Shrek the Third over and over again. Mostly it's not any good, but there are a few gems.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;like Sleeping Beauty.&amp;nbsp; She reminds me of someone I know.I'll be 35 in just over 3 months and I've decided that life is one big joke brought on by someone who has nothing to do and likes to laugh at other people. I lost my job about 3 weeks ago.&amp;nbsp; I worked for Countrywide - recently bought out by Bank of America. One of many on the chopping block to save money and survive this financial mess. My in-laws have suffered cancer, brutal shootings, miscarriages, home and job losses - all in the last 3 months. &amp;lt;&amp;lt; My current 'To Do' list &amp;gt;&amp;gt;1. Reconnect with&amp;nbsp;my&amp;nbsp;husband.&amp;nbsp; We've been together for 14.5 years.&amp;nbsp; Married for 7 years.&amp;nbsp; After spending the last 5 years mostly removed from me for job and family reasons, he has been officially back home for good for almost two months. These last 3 weeks that I've been jobless are the first segment of life in 5 years where we've been together 24/7 without interruption. Having him away for so long made me re-evaluate everything I thought a relationship was.&amp;nbsp; It's damn hard, but he's my salvation and I love him.&amp;nbsp; I don't know how those connected to the military handle this.&amp;nbsp; At least I knew mine was coming home.2. Beg for a new job.&amp;nbsp; A career I'm not even sure I want to continue after 10 years of the same old thing.&amp;nbsp; Why should I have to beg?&amp;nbsp; They should be lining up at my door.&amp;nbsp; And there is something SO wrong about having to slave away your whole life for someone else.&amp;nbsp; What does it accomplish?&amp;nbsp; Nothing.3. Schedule time for fill-in-the-blank education.&amp;nbsp; My husband goes back to college in the Spring to continue his Civil Engineering degree - now that he can.&amp;nbsp; I've learned that during these&amp;nbsp;past 5 years my field has changed, and while I have my degree, for some it's not enough.&amp;nbsp; Certifications are now required, rather than a bonus option.&amp;nbsp; Whoever thought that would happen?&amp;nbsp; When would a degree with 4 or more years of hard work behind it, EVER be next to invalid?&amp;nbsp; That's the way it feels like, anyway.4. Find out where my creative layer went.&amp;nbsp; Despite the fact that simple words come easy here, my writing is suffering its worst block in history. My fan fiction stories are outlined, but going nowhere. I've edited the next 3 chapters for a month, to no avail. My original fiction that I had hoped to submit for publication this year is so far into extreme drought that I wonder if my brain has dried to dust and blown away.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The more I try, the more livid I&amp;nbsp;become.&amp;nbsp; Breaking glass works wonders.5.&amp;nbsp; Options I won't post here.&amp;nbsp; Stuff other people seem accomplish at the drop of a&amp;nbsp;hat&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;I can't.&amp;nbsp; Things I don't need the whole world telling me, &amp;quot;it will happen one day.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Go feel sorry for someone else.Right now life is pulling me into so many directions that I feel lost, I feel helpless, and I am deep into massive anxiety mode.&amp;nbsp; The most I can do is sit here and drool when I think about it all.&amp;nbsp; Drinking bouts of&amp;nbsp;Bodegas Montecillo&amp;nbsp;help - a lot.&amp;nbsp; It used to help my writing.&amp;nbsp; Now, it's like I'm dead inside.
