Whew! I forgot a bunch, but who is counting?Oh its also brought to you by FreeTibet.org. Ok I&amp;#8217;m kidding about that one. But seriously. Being in the Olympics is all about representing your country, right? On August 8th, just over 10,000 athletes will compete in 28 different sports. In the United States,viewers will be given the opportunity to watch virtually all of the over 300 events onseveral different channels. NBC hasa website up that will give viewers the tv schedule for each event. I know most folks are looking forward to watchingedge-of-your-seat action with table tennis, synchronized swimming, and trampoline (is that really an event?), but I instead will focus on some of the othersports. Swimming I&amp;#8217;m not talking about Synchronized Swimming, folks. I&amp;#8217;m talkin&amp;#8217; aboutsome good ole fashion freestyle, breaststroke, and backstrokes with Michael Phelps. Catch all of the action starting on August 9th at 3:30pm EDT. Basketball On Sunday August 10th, watch the Men&amp;#8217;s U.S. team play the China National team. What is at stake is a major butchering of the U.S. Team for the 2nd time in two olympics. We&amp;#8217;ll see if the U.S. team can play together like the original Dream Team. The game starts at 10:00AM EDT on Sunday, August 10th. Gymnastics The particular interest here would be Women&amp;#8217;s Gymnastics. The Women&amp;#8217;s team qualifying starts on August 10th at 9:30PM EDT. Soccer See the U.S. men&amp;#8217;s team pair off against Japan on Thursday, August 7th at 5:00AM EDT on MSNBC. See the U.S. women&amp;#8217;s team pair off on Wednesday, August 6th at 7:30AM EDT on MSNBC. Track and Field The action begins on Friday, August 15th with the men&amp;#8217;s qualifying for the &amp;#8220;fastest man in the world&amp;#8221; 100M. We&amp;#8217;ll be lucky if anyone doesn&amp;#8217;t test positive for steroids! Please check out the website for more events scheduled, especially if you&amp;#8217;re hoping to watch water polo, judo, and fencing.
