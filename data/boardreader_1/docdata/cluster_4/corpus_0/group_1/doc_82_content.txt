That boy who couldn't sing and had all those stupid hairstyles on AMERICAN IDOL a few seasons back? Just when we thought his 15 minutes were up and we were done with the boy forever, he's resurfaced. Nationwide Insurance has tapped the now 18-year-old to appear in the company's ad campaign, &amp;quot;Life Comes at You Fast.&amp;quot; Pseudo-celebrities, such as Kevin Federline, Fabio, and MC Hammer, have already poked fun at themselves in earlier commercials and now it's Sanjaya's turn. In the new ad he sings, sports that infamous (ie: stupid) &amp;quot;pony hawk&amp;quot; hairstyle and visits a wise man who tells him he needs a retirement plan... and a haircut. That's very similar to his short stint on AMERICAN IDOL when the judges would often tell him that he couldn't sing. Ha! [Nationwide] We know you're just dying to see this commercial... so look for it after the jump.
