This july is rather exciting month- the key word i have selected is: change, change, change.   A New flat Hope this can be a rather long term accommodation for me.  Secondment to BARCLAYS   Ioannis was right. A week in BARCLAYS let me realise that i used to work '4-days' a week at DELOITTE. The intensity of work is keeping everyone very busy. No pain, no gain, i guess.  Sarah (my director) was right:- 'This is something you can get your teeth into!' Yeah.. right^^ my cocky smile has gone now and painfully replaced with 39 degree fever and constant coughing. I guess she forgot to mention the BARCLAYS virus... which got me ill for 5 days with a chest infection. Not the good start i was hoping for,nethertheless, i'm going back to work tomorrow.  Holiday to Greece i'm taking off to Greece this Sunday to have my long waiting summer holiday. Let's see what is it so special about the 'Blue and White' country... ... :) Beach babes with great bodies and gorgeous tan, Maybe? lol...
