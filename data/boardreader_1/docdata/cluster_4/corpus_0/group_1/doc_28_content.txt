 Hi, everyone, I've been gone for the summer and struggling with dial-up. I'll be back to post more often on Writers' Rest soon. If you have any suggestions for guest interviews please let me know. It may be a little sporadic around here as we're leading up to the conference, but after that I'm sure we'll have LOTS to chat about! Today I'm a guest blogger over at Rachelle Gardner's site. Pop over for my take on rejection if you can. You'll have to cut and paste the link as I can't get it to work! Sorry!http://www.cba-ramblings.blogspot.com/
