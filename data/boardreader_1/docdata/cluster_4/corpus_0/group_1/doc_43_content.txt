Please check out the Japanese American Relocation Project Archives, renovation of a trail through the woods that used to be a Japanese neighborhood, and a virtual noblewoman reading what is widely regarded as the first novel ever written in Japanese or any other language. You know what other anniversary it is?: Harriet handing George a report warning that some guy named Bin Laden wanted to attack the United States. Clean, Clear, Water: preferably without getting killed. Good advice: The folks who brought us P90x and 10 Minute Trainer (which is a very good workout, by the way) tell us to Think Thin. A damn shame: The CDC reports that average waits at American Emergency Departments have risen from 38 minutes to almost an hour.  What makes matters even worse is that&amp;#8217;s an &amp;#8220;average&amp;#8221; number, not a &amp;#8220;typical&amp;#8221; number.  About half those people actually waited less than 31 minutes, but the other half had much longer waits. Why?  More visits and fewer ERs to take patients!  Oh, and 17% of those patients had no insurance. No word on the relative acuity of those patient&amp;#8217;s complaints. Running Argument: The USPS says private companies always do things better.  Congress says prove it.  The USPS replies duh, private companies always do things better. Now think about this.  For under $0.50, I can get an envelope delivered almost anyplace within a hundred miles the next day, and delivered almost anywhere in the lower 48 within 2-5 days. How much does FedEx and UPS cost to get the same letter delivered in the same time frames?  How much would a courier for a local letter cost?  In what possible way could privatization make things better? I love Paris?: I have to admit, Paris Hilton is classier (and smarter) than most people give her credit for. Her reply to the McCain ad is clever, polite, and cutting. Maybe e-passports weren&amp;#8217;t such a good idea: They&amp;#8217;ve already been cracked. Get BAC: The Countrywide merger with Bank of America is threatened by bondholder lawsuits. That&amp;#8217;s over and above the State AGs that want a piece of Countrywide. Oh Freddie: Freddie Freddie Freddie, what&amp;#8217;s with the losing so much money?  How on earth did you end up with a situation where 10% of your portfolio accounted for half your losses? Where&amp;#8217;s Poochie?: (Reference) Diane Duane (yes, that Diane Duane) points out GPS for dogs, and notes that it should work for cats too.  Some nut suggesting using it for your kids in 3&amp;#8230; 2&amp;#8230; 1&amp;#8230;. And finally: why bailouts stink but why we need them anyway.
