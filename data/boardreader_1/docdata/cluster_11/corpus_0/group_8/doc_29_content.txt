Empty Wallet - Source: Flickr In fact, Thursday was such a bad day in the stock market that it wiped away the positive gains that occurred on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell to 6,594.4, a loss of more than 280. The Dow hasnt been this low since the middle months of 2007. The Standard &amp; Poors index also dropped a little bit more than 4% to land on 682.6. The S&amp;P is as low as it has been since 1996. The NASDAQ index fell around 4% as well, while the Russell 200 dropped almost 6% on the day. Virtually every industry felt the sting on Thursday. The biggest losers were General Motors and a number of the companies in the struggling banking industry including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Each of those three banks dropped at least 11% on the day. GM, on the other hand, fell more than 15%. While some stock market experts think that the market may be nearing a bottom, other experts believe that the Dow Jones industrial average could end up at around 5,000 before the rebounding begins.
