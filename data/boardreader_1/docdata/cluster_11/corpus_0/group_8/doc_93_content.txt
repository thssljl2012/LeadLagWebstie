Citibank was priced at about $28 a share during the last year-today its still overvalued at $1.13. AIG saw a high of $49.50 and is now listed for .43 cents-this was after years of their stock being valued at $70. Bank of America went for about $44 dollars a share and now trades at $3.59. Wells Fargo was $45 and is now $10. Chase has not done so bad, it was $25 and is now $8-no, that&#8217;s still pretty bad. Ford Motor Company has sucked for a while-the year high was $9 and now it&#8217;s $1.89. Ford trading at $2 a share-wow. GM&#8217;s high was $24 and is now about $2. Compare that with Toyota which was at $108 during the last 12 months and is now $60, or VW which went from $232 at one point and is now down to $52. Both down, but no where as near to out as American auto makers. All kinds of stocks are down, not just the ones that make the news. General Electric was $38 and is now $6.69. Chevron went from $105 to $60. General Mills from $72 to $51. Disney from $35 to $16. Coke from $62 to $40. Pepsi from $75 to $47. Google from $600 to $318. Wal-Mart from $64 to $48. Now it&#8217;s possible to look at this as common sense rearing it&#8217;s ugly head. This was all make believe money anyway. None of the money on Wall Street becomes real until someone sells and some else buys. I used to be into the whole stock market thing. Like all forms of gambling, it seems so easy to do. I spent a bit of money and lost just about all of it.  I read a really fun book called Rule The Freakin Markets which talked about the glory days of the Stock Market Bubble. The basic advice, as I recall it, of Rule The Freakin Markets was buy stock-any stock at all-and sell it when it goes up 20%. See the tiny flaw with this plan? You need to know what stocks are going to go up. Well, if you knew that, you wouldn&#8217;t really need the book. I had one winner-Lion Gate Films-twelve month high $10 dollars, now about $5. If I won the Lotto in the next couple of days, I&#8217;d likely buy Amazon.com-year&#8217;s high $92 now selling at $65-but one of the only stocks I&#8217;ve looked at with a raising chart instead of a falling one. But short of winning the lotto, there are no stocks in my future, which is kind of sad. The entire market is on sale, and looks to keep going lower for a little while yet to come. But no one has any money to snatch up all those great deals, and that&#8217;s why they are all so cheap. When everyone has money to throw away, that&#8217;s when things like Google make mad money. Krispy Kreme is going for a little over $1, but only had a high of $5 for the year. Like a lot of stocks I used to like, Krispy Kreme is now a penny stock. Like House Flipping, being a Day Trader was something everyone thought they could do well. We just didn&#8217;t know all the people running Wall Street thought they were Day Traders as well. You never know when a market has hit bottom until it starts to go up again. There is no sign that we have hit bottom yet and there is no reason to think it will get back to where it was once it does rise again. Comic books and signed 1st editions are looking better all the time.
