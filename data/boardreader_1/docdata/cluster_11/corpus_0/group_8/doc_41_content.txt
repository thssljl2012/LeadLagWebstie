 Insurance group AIG has just reported the largest quarterly loss in corporate history with a Q4 print of -$61.7bn.As expected, the newswires are all over this story. However, of the six or seven articles I've scanned, beyond recycling the same fact about the quarterly record, there is no mention about whether the total loss for 2008 is an annual record. Surely readers would like to know? I appreciate business journalists are a busy bunch right now but there really is no excuse for not putting the 2008 loss in context, especially as reporters saw this monster number coming and could easily have prepared a historical comparison table or paragraph well ahead of time. Plain sloppy is what I say.Anyway, from my quick (and possibly dodgy) reckoning here is how it stacks up:AIG loss: $99.3bn (2008)AOL Time Warner loss: $98.7 billion (2002)GM loss: $30.2bn (2007)So yes, it looks like AIG has just pipped AOL to the top-spot!The top three losses in the UK are:RBS loss: 24.1bn (2008)Vodafone loss: 21.8bn (y/ending March 2006)Lloyds loss: approx 10.8bn (2008)Half of these six have come in the last seven days!
