You have to wonder why Barack Obama suggested on Tuesday that stocks might be a long-term buy.  Is his administration ready to make peace with Wall Street? Is he scared about the stock market moving lower? Or can he just not resist the temptation to call a market bottom? Whatever his impulse, Mr. Obama should reconsider his bullishness. Lately, Wall Street has been no place for a contrarian investor seeking to do battle with the bears.  And that would include a President seeking to defend an indefensible budget. Now, if there is anyone who might empathize with a fellow contrarian, it would be me. I have long believed Wall Street isn&#8217;t all-seeing and omniscient, and that good companies should worry about their businesses and the share price would follow. But the past year and a half has been especially brutal for the bullish contrarian. The bears have been proven right in every single instance I can recall. You name the company&#8211; Bear Stearns, Countrywide Financial, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America and now, General Electric.  You name the market&#8211;every equity market world-wide, the ABS, CDS, MBS, CDO and most other credit markets.  Or name the economic statistic&#8211;home prices, new housing starts, oil prices, unemployment rates or GDP growth.  You would have done very poorly by moving against the crowd.  Take it from me.Last summer and fall, I went long the XLF, the financial sector exchange traded fund, at an average of a little less than $19 before dumping most of it in November at half that value.  In early February, I suggested that Jeff Immelt at GE must know &#8220;something&#8221; the market didn&#8217;t. How else&#8211;given how bad things were&#8211;could he possibly and so stubbornly keep the dividend? Three weeks later he cut GE&#8217;s dividend by nearly 70%.  Unfortunately, I put Obama&#8217;s &#8220;buy&#8221; call in the same camp as Immelt hanging onto the dividend. These are well-meaning gestures founded largely on faith, rather than facts, that the market inevitably will prove wrong.  GE&#8217;s reputation and Immelt&#8217;s assurances meant that GE got the benefit of the doubt from investors six months ago. But the more the market has learned about GE&#8217;s balance sheet and the economy, the lower the shares have fallen. Same with Obama. Investors wanted to believe in him. The day of the election, the Dow was driven to more than 9600. Today, post-release of the Obama budget, it is at 6800, down 30%. The more investors have learned about the state of the economy and Obama&#8217;s plans for it, the less they rate the stock markets prospects.  Obama&#8217;s higher taxes and antibusiness policies have shaken investor confidence. And Wall Street hasn&#8217;t found his budget credible. Unemployment cresting at under 9%? GDP growth of more than 3% next year? Wall Street thinks not. Of course, Wall Street is notoriously fickle. But for Obama to dismiss the market as an indicator that &#8220;bobs up and down day to day&#8221;&#8211;or as a &#8220;natural reaction&#8221; to the country&#8217;s economic woes is to miss its message of late. Stocks are down in 11 of the past 12 sessions, and five straight trading days since the Obama budget was released. That isn&#8217;t &#8220;bobbing.&#8221; That is the market declaring a state of emergency. Mr. Obama may want to have a chat with Mr. Immelt. In the past year, Mr. Immelt has bought GE stock at $33, $15, and a few days back at $8.26. The shares now trade under $6.50.  So much for the contrarian buy. Mr. Obama, please take note. Update: The post has been changed to reflect that the Dow industrials closed at 9625 on Nov. 4.
