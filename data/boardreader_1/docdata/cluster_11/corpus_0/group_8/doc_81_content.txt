Everett  When a zombie (stock) attacks, play parlor games.   John Carney of Clusterstock alerts us to a sobering reality: As of last week, Citigroup&#8217;s (C) ATM fees were 300% of Citi&#8217;s share price.  The troubled bank&#8217;s stock has risen slightly since then, it&#8217;s still trading below the $3 the bank charges non-Citi customers for the use of its ATMs. Citi is one example of a &#8220;zombie stock&#8221;, which my colleague Peter McKay defines as &#8220;generating little profit or price appreciation for shareholders over a span of years or decades to come.&#8221; This sparked a recessionary game here in the newsroom with such zombie stocks and other bargain-bin shares. It&#8217;s a financial version of the schoolyard game Would You Rather. The math changes a bit, as stock prices change, but here are some examples:  Would you rather have&#8230; -One share of Citi or a trip to a Citi ATM? Bank of America (BAC) or a BofA ATM trip? -Four shares of American Express (AXP) or a AmEx Starwood Preferred Guest credit card for a year? -One share of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) or 3,100 copies of &#8220;The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life&#8221;? -One share of Starbucks (SBUX) or a bag of decaf espresso roast? -30 shares of Crocs (CROX) or a pair of Crocs Caymans? Yes, this is slightly financially morbid. But hey, we&#8217;re watching our 401(k)s erode, too.  Wallet readers, chime in with your own market-inspired Would You Rathers.
