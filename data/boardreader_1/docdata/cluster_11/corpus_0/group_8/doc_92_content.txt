The Federal Reserve also released its Beige Book Wednesday with a bleak outlook.The S&amp;P 500 has been rose above 700 and the VIX, an implied volatility measure for the S&amp;P 500 index, is down. However, its level has been indicating that investors see  bear markets lasting for another two years.   LIBOR rates once again climbed as banks are increasingly nervous about lending to each other and return to hoarding capital, further locking up credit markets as dismal economic news continues to come out. The TED Spread widened as investors are jittery after corporate bonds fell last month for the first time since October as the U.S. recession deepened, according to Bloomberg. The price of T-bills also fell as investors remain concerned about market supply. The Treasury Department has been selling record amounts of debt, raising more than $94 billion in the last two weeks alone. The Treasury Department is set to announce on Friday the details of more T-bill auctions. - George White and Maria Woehr                     Troubled Wall Street        Prices at approximately 4:00 pm ET                 Name       Price at          open       Price          at 4:00 pm       Change       Mkt cap                 J.P.
