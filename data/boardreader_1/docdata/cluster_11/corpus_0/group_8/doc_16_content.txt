The Institutional Risk Analyst has released its fourth quarter 2008 banking industry stress test results.   Its news release focuses on the top four banks, Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).  Draw your own conclusions. People who know more about this than I do discuss it in the comments section on The Big Picture.  I dont own these stocks.
