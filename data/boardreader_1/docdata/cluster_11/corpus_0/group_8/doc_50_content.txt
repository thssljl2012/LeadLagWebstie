The markets struggled to break even Monday. The Dow slipped 69.06 points to  6,557.88, the S&amp;P 500  fell 4.92 points to 678.46, and the Nasdaq  dropped 18.24 points to 1,275.61. Financial stocks were mostly in the green. Capital One Financial Corp.'s (NYSE:COF) stocks are up after announcing that it is cutting its quarterly dividend by 87% to save $500 million annually. The cut leaves only BB&amp;T Corp. (NYSE:BBT) as the sole top 10 U.S. bank that hasn't cut its dividend.Meanwhile, Citigroup Inc.'s (NYSE:C) stocks are just about breaking even at around $1. News is the bank doled out $13 million to employees whose trips to resorts were canceled and it spent about $3.5 million to provide rewards for top-performing advisers at its Smith Barney brokerage unit.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) may be responsible for the $41.1 billion Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) and Schering-Plough Corp. (NYSE:SGP) deal, but both stocks are down on the announcement that Barclays Capital cut its price targets on both firms. The report says the banks are expected to post losses for December, "mostly due to asset markdowns, investment losses and 'very subdued' core earnings." Still, Morgan Stanley jumped to the top of the mergers and acquisitions advisory rankings for the Merck Schering-Plough deal. - Maria Woehr                Troubled Wall Street        Prices at approximately 1:30 pm ET                 Name       Price at          open       Price          at 1:30 pm       Change       Mkt cap                 J.P.
