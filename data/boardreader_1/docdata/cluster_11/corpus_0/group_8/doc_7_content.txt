The bear market that equities entered a little more than three weeks ago accelerated markedly in Thursday&#8217;s trading session, as several landmark events both underscored the depths of the problems confounding equity investors in the current climate, and exacerbated the already-troubled psyche of Wall Street. Shares of Citigroup- a little more thantwo years removed from its days asthe big dog in banking - plunged below a buck a share in Thursday&#8217;s trading, winnowing what was, as recently as late 2006 a market cap of more than a quarter-trillion dollars to a valuation of just over $5 billion. Citigroup, which reigned as the fifth-largest company in the U.S. by market cap when the stock market reached its zenith in October 2007, has since fallen to 238th place on the list of companies by size. The slide below $1 made Citi the first of the banking giants to trade as, effectively, a penny stock (though it managed to inch above $1 by the close), it may not, in fact, be the last. Bank of America (BAC)traded for just a hair over $3 a share in the session, while large regionals such as Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB)haslaboredbelow $2 a share, with a 20% decline Thursday, and Regions Financial (RF)slid below $3 in a session that saw the stock lose 12%. Worries about further cuts to banks&#8217; credit ratingsremained a manifest problem. Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC)lost 15% after Moody&#8217;s indicated it might downgrade its debt rating, and JPMorgan (JPM)sank 14%, after the ratings agency changed its outlook on the bank&#8217;s credit to negative. Investors also have worried that the government&#8217;s plans to run banks&#8217; balance sheets through a &#8216;&#8217;stress test&#8221; may result in the decision to place some failing banks into receivership, a move that would wipe out the value of common equity. Citigroup&#8217;s move below $1 a share wasn&#8217;t the only thing that promised to lodge March 5 firmly in the memory of traders and investors. Shares of General Motors (GM)plunged below $2 a share after the company&#8217;s auditors expressed concerns about the auto maker&#8217;s ability to continue to operate as a going concern, the most-concrete admission to-date of the risks the auto maker might have no recourse but to seek bankruptcy protection. Several of the industrial names that paced Wednesday&#8217;s modest rally - gains erased within minutes of Thursday&#8217;s opening - lost ground as one day&#8217;s hope for a giant stimulus windfall from China evaporated under some mealy comments from government officials. Shares of Caterpillar (CAT)dropped 8%, Textron (TXT)shed 15%, and Alcoa (AA)slid 16%. The declines highlighted the difficulties the bulls have had in launching the market on anything approaching a string of sustained success. The Dow industrial average hasn&#8217;t had even a two-day winning steak in amonth. Speaking of the Dow, the industrial average tumbled 281 points, a decline of 4%, to close at 6594. The industrial average has lost 20% - the measure of decline generallythat would generally qualify as a full-fledged bear market - and has done so in aslittle as 18 trading days. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 surrendered 30 points, or 4.25%, to sink to 682. That marked the lowest close on the 500 since September &#8230; of 1996.
