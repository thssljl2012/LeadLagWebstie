Rumors that Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) faced nationalization helped drive multiple-session triple-digit sell-offs during the last month, but Citi paid back some of what it helped to lose as news on Tuesday of CEO Vikram Pandit's letter to employees boasting of a strong start to its quarter revived an ailing market, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 379.44 points to close at 6,926.49. Pandit's positive prose also provided Citi with a needed boost, lifting shares 40 cents or 38.10% to $1.45 on Tuesday.Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), whose name had also been tossed around in the nationalization rumor mill, rose $1.04 or 27.73% to $4.79 per share on Tuesday. Also helping to lift spirits on the Street was news that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke argued Tuesday that regulators should make some improvements to controversial mark-to-market accounting rules. However, he stopped short of saying the rule should be suspended.Bond insurer MBIA Inc. (NYSE:MBI), which has taken particularly hard hits on mark-to-market rules due to its insurance of toxic structured finance products, jumped 58 cents or 18.77% Tuesday to close at $3.67 per share. The gain can be partly attributed to a renewed vote of confidence from private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which late Monday disclosed it upped its stake in the battered monoline insurer to 25% from about 23.7%. Among deal stocks, the bulk of activity continues to be in the healthcare sector. Schering-Plough Corp. (NYSE:SGP) shares climbed 95 cents or 4.72% to $21.08 in the wake of a Monday announcement that Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) proposed a $41 billion cash-and-stock deal for New Jersey neighbor. Meanwhile, Merck bounced back from Monday's market retreat and closed up $1.21 or 5.76% to $22.20 a share. - Michael Rudnick
