Wall Street is giving a (for now at least) thumbs up to the Treasury Department&#8217;s toxic assets bank plan in the form of the Dow making its fifth-biggest point gain in its history. That&#8217;s the initial thumbs-up, which could hold. On the other hand, Wall Street could eventually hold up a much different finger.  But the news today was heartening to all Americans who want to see the administration succeed. The Wall Street Journal: The Treasury Department&#8217;s new plan to take toxic assets off of banks&#8217; balance sheets spurred a blistering stock rally Monday, leaving major indexes with their biggest percentage gains since October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 497.48 points, or 6.8%, to 7775.86, the fifth-biggest point gain in the measure&#8217;s history. Monday&#8217;s finish marked the highest close for the Dow, which is up 18.77% from its 12-year closing low of 6547.05 hit March 9, since Feb. 13. The Dow was pushed upward by gains of 25% for J.P. Morgan Chase and 26% for Bank of America. Citigroup rose 20% and American Express bounced 19%. Alcoa rose 13% and General Electric gained 9.3%.
