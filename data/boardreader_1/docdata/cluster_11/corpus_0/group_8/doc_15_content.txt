CITI, GM COULD FACE DOW DELISTING - New York Post If the US government assumes greater control over US bank Citigroup or automaker General Motors, that might &#8220;trigger&#8221; their removal from the Dow index, the Dow Jones Indexes said yesterday. John Prestbo, editor and executive director of the DJ Indexes, which selects the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, said he tracks both companies &#8220;every day to see what the status is.&#8221; Should either stock be removed, &#8220;everything is on the table basically in terms of replacements,&#8221; Prestbo said.  The Dow used to be designed to try to emulate the performance of the U.S. economy - big banks, railroads, manufacturing enterprises. It should be interesting to see what they come up with now - and in the future.
