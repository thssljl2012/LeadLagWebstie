Nationalization rumors have swirled around three Dow components lately  Bank of America, Citigroup, and General Motors &#8212; knocking their shares to historic lows. But even without the aid of such speculation  always denied by executives  dozens of other companies&#8217; shares have performed similarly lately, according to an analysis done for WSJ.com by S&#038;P&#8217;s Capital IQ unit. What is the market trying to tell us about all these companies?  In normal times, when the government isn&#8217;t undertaking once-in-a-lifetime Keynesian intervention in the U.S. economy, stock performance like that of the names mentioned above would suggest likely bankruptcy or, at best, prolonged life as a &#8220;zombie&#8221; company, generating little profit or price appreciation for shareholders over a span of years or decades to come. Those fates may still befall many of the market&#8217;s most distressed companies spanning every sector, not just the banking industry, where the &#8220;zombie&#8221; phenomenon has already garnered attention among executives, the media, and senior policy makers, said David Kovacs, chief investment officer of Turner Investment Partners, which independently verified S&#038;P&#8217;s data. &#8220;When stocks lose that kind of value, they almost never recover,&#8221; said Mr. Kovacs, who has also studied the long-term performance of companies that were nearly worthless after the dotcom crash. &#8220;After a while, they&#8217;re just there. But you never get anything out of them as an investor.&#8221; Each of the three above mentioned blue chips is down more than 85% from its 52-week high and trading under $5 a share. Applying those metrics to the broad S&#038;P 1500, there were 70 additional names that have performed similarly through Tuesday&#8217;s close. The 10 worst performers from their 52-week highs are listed below, and you can view an Excel document with the full list here.
