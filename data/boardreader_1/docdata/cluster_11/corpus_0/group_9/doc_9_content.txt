The stress has got to be killing bankers. Not the stress of the job - the strain of private jet travel, the glad-handing with cronies stacked on the board, thestruggle to make ends meet when year-over-year compensation tops out at no more millions than received the previous year - which has become a familiar, if fetid, part of the landscape. (Thank goodness that landscape has been cropped like the fairway on the ninth hole at Augusta.) We&#8217;re talking about the stress test. The results of which will be released to banks themselves beginning Friday, before some details are revealed publiclyon May 4. For their part, bank stocks have held up remarkably well over the last several weeks. Thanks to almost-universally strong first-quarter results - or, at least,not-as-dreadful-as-feared first-quarter results - most of thefinancials have held onto the gains banked since the bounce off theearly-March bottoms. That trend has extended into Friday. Bank of America(BAC)has ticked up about 1%, Wells Fargo (WFC)adds about 3%, and JPMorgan (JPM)has held flat at just under $34 a share, still more than double the March 6 lows, and about as high as it&#8217;s traded during this bear-market rally. Combine with a couple accommodating earnings results - American Express (AXP)bounced 6%as its net dropped 55% but still topped estimates, and Ford Motor (F)surged 21% after its $1.4 billion loss didn&#8217;t realize the worst of the fears - and it adds up to a constructive start to the trading session. The S&amp;P 500 (GSPC)is looking narrowly higher, up about half a percentage point on theopen. However, it&#8217;s going to take an even more-impressive rally than the one the index staged late Thursday, when it capped a sluggish session with a sprint to the post that allowed it to tack on aone percent closing gain. That is, if the index is hell-bent on keeping alive the rally off those March lows that has seen the S&amp;P 500 record week-over-week gains six times in a row, the longest such streak since the mid-1930s. As it stands, the S&amp;P would need something on the order of an 18-point - or two percent - advance to get back to where it endedlast week. Nineteen points would push it into positive territory for this week. The stress &#8230; boy, it&#8217;s a killer, ain&#8217;t it?
