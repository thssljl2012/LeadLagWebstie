 Gaia Online   "Chains4w"    "Resid3nt"    You are implicitly claiming that DOW's fall is Obama's fault, which it isn't.         Wrong.   Very Wrong.      CRAZY Wrong.        You are reading it upside down, I suppose:      Quote:  U.S. stock futures fell, indicating the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index may end a two-day advance, after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner  delayed the announcement  of the Obama administration's financial-recovery plan.

Conditions for proving that A caused B  Precondition - Plan must be in motion (precondition not met)  Conditions - Finding causation on indicators.    DOW is not an answer for the reasons described before.
