   Dow Falls Below 7000 for First Time Since 1997                 By      Ylan Q. Mui         Washington Post Staff Writer   Monday, March 2, 2009; 10:53 AM                     The      Dow   Jones industrial average      opened below 7000 for the first time in 12 years this morning following news that   government will invest another $30 billion in insurance giant AIG after it posted the largest quarterly losses in corporate   history.                  The Dow plummeted 160 points, or 2.3 percent, to 6903 a little over an hour into trading -- a level not seen since     1997. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.5 percent, or 18 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.9 percent, or 25     points.              Shares of AIG were up 6 cents, or 14.4 percent, to 48 cents in early trading but are off 99 percent for the year.     The company      announced this morning      it had lost $61.7 billion during the fourth     quarter and would access $30 billion in taxpayer money as part of the restructuring of its federal bailout. The move marks the fourth time the government     has stepped in to help the company since September                   LINK
