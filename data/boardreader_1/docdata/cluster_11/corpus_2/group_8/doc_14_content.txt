                      Quote:              Arrangers JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. added seven banks to a syndicate of lenders for Sears Holdings Corp. JPMorgan spokesman Adam Castellani said  the loan is oversubscribed, with $5.5 billion in commitments so far.     Lampert, 42, whose ESL Investments Inc. helped revive struggling companies such as Kmart and AutoZone Inc., emulates the investment style of Warren Buffett.  The banks are betting that Kmart Chairman Lampert will, as Buffett did with Berkshire Hathaway Inc., use Sears Holdings as a springboard for dozens of acquisitions that would generate millions in fees.     ''He has a good reputation for what he has done so far, and his deals are big,'' said Roy Smith, a New York University finance professor and former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.                The big money is betting that Lampert will be successful with this deal.
