Bank credit concerns hit record high -CDS NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - Concerns about the health of large banks jumped to a record high on Monday as worries about the fate of Citigroup (C) continued to weigh on debt spreads, according to a key index. The CDR Counterparty Risk Index, which measures the average credit spread of the largest credit derivative dealers, rose above 300 basis points for the first time, lead by weakness in credit default swaps on Citigroup and Barclays Bank BARC.L, according to Credit Derivatives Research, which manages the index. Credit default swaps on both banks weakened 30 basis points, while Bank of America's (BAC) swaps widened 15 basis points, CDR said. Citigroup and Bank of America's swaps are both at record wides, the research firm added. "BofA trades at all-time wides even as its stock is rallying and Citi currently trades at 600 basis points, the widest of any name in the index," CDR said in a release. Bank of America's shares rose after Barron's said the bank could avoid Citigroup's fate and post strong earnings once the turmoil is over. For details, see [ID:nN08396014]. Credit default swaps insuring the debt of Merrill Lynch (MER) and Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 25 basis points and 22.5 basis points, respectively, CDR said.
