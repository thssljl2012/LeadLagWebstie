            Quote from: El Campeador on March  7, 2009, 04:52:44 AM   I did climb on a few slides down yes, but not Citibank, although I always thought the ADIA investment was a terrible move on Abu Dhabi&#039;s part. I wonder what happened to the financial advisors who convinced Abu Dhabi to commit to this $7.5b+ deal, now that it&#039;s a race between the US government forcing a conversion, or their conversion dates that stretch out to March 2010 I think. Strike price of $31 through $37 a share, and the stock is in $1 purgatory.   Never try to catch a falling knife.    In this case, it&#039;s raining falling knives!  And there&#039;s many things I&#039;d do for a Brunello, truly a great wine of the world.
