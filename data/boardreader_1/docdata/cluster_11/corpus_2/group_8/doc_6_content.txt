Roughly 95% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 finished with a loss.      Though losses were broad-based, financials were dealt the worst blow. The sector fell 9.9% with particular weakness among diversified banks (-16.5%) and other diversified financial services companies (-13.2%).      Moody's announced it is reviewing the credit ratings of Bank of America (BAC 3.17, -0.42) and Wells Fargo (WFC 8.12, -1.54) for possible downgrade. Moody's lowered its outlook for JPMorgan Chase (JPM 16.60, -2.70) to negative from stable. Sellers pushed both WFC and JPM shares to new multiyear lows.                       Now I'm positive Obama's policy's are going to fail. Why? His spending bill has been announced - stock market went down hill from there. Quite the opposite was supposed to happen. FEIL.
