Although I can pick up but I don't intend to, I prefer contra under current volatile market conditions, can sleep better at nite......           Me still very undecided.                I took a punt tdy for following reasons.         1. Drop from 9.28  to 8.88..some rebound possible from here on day to day movement.        2. Trade on a 20 pts range..        3. Buy here 8.90  to sell 9.05 for contra..        4. This lvl shd hold for next few trading sessions..cos the drop   from          11.00  to 9.00    too fast and dramatic..though blame it on citibank         share....plummet to  below $1 from $2. the past 10 days. which drag down most of the bank share.        5.  Watch the STI...may try the low of 1474....but reckon will try 1550 first.        ..... Long term may see UOB share ard $7.50 as the next support lvl...        Just my view....DYOR.
