The dividend is not even the biggest worry now,,,, maybe 1 month ago they could have cut it in half,,, share price drops 10% to &pound;1 and then recovers gradually,,, now bit late to repair the damage,,, and would be quite embarrassing to do the U turn too,,,    The real worry at the moment is that largest stakeholders Legal &amp; General are having a steep sell-off at the moment, which is raising fears of an insurance giant collapse,,, specifically that AIG is also hanging on the thread,,, thats why its been well worse than the general market yesterday / today,,
