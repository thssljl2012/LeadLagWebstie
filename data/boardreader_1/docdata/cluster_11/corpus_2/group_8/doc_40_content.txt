 CWEI Message Board Posts          Recs: 2              OT - Mean Street: Barack Obama, the Jeff Immelt of U.S. Presidents/Blog     http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/03/04/mean-street-barack-obama-the-jeff-immelt-of-us-presidents/        March 4, 2009, 12:28 pm    Posted by Deal Journal        You have to wonder why Barack Obama suggested that stocks might be a long-term buy on Tuesday.      Is his administration ready to make peace with Wall Street? Is he scared about the stock market moving lower? Or can he just not resist the temptation to call a market bottom?           Whatever his impulse, Mr. Obama should reconsider his bullishness. Lately, Wall Street has been no place for a contrarian investor seeking to do battle with the bears.     And that would include a President seeking to defend an indefensible budget.    Now, if there is anyone who might empathize with a fellow contrarian, it would be me.     I have long believed that Wall Street is not all-seeing and omniscient, and that good companies should worry about their businesses and the share price would follow.    But the last year and a half has been especially brutal for the bullish contrarian. The bears have been proven right in every single instance I can recall.    You name the company  Bear Stearns, Countrywide, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman, AIG, Citi, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America and now, General Electric.     You name the market  every equity market worldwide, the ABS, CDS, MBS, CDO and most other credit markets.     Or name the economic statistic  home prices, new housing starts, oil prices, unemployment rates or GDP growth.       You would have done very poorly by moving against the crowd.     Take it from me. Last summer and fall, I went long the XLF, the financial sector ETF, at an average of just under $19 before dumping most of it in November at half that value.      In early February, I suggested that Jeff Immelt at GE must know something the market didnt. How else  given how bad things were  could he possibly and so stubbornly keep the dividend?    Three weeks later he cut GEs dividend by nearly 70%.     Unfortunately, I put Obamas buy call in the same camp as Immelt hanging onto the dividend. These are well-meaning gestures founded largely on faith, rather than facts, that the market inevitably will prove wrong.     GEs reputation and Immelts assurances meant that GE got the benefit of the doubt from investors six months ago. But the more the market has learned about GEs balance sheet and the economy, the lower the shares have fallen.    Same with Obama. Investors wanted to believe in him. The day after the election, the Dow was driven higher to over 9600. Today, post-release of the Obama budget, it trades at 6800, down 30%.    The more investors have learned about the state of the economy and Obamas plans for it, the less they rate the stock markets prospects.      Obamas higher taxes and anti-business policies have shaken investor confidence. And Wall Street has not found his budget credible. Unemployment cresting at under 9%? GDP growth at over 3% next year? Wall Street thinks not.    Of course, Wall Street is notoriously fickle. But for Obama to dismiss the market as an indicator that bobs up and down day to day   or as a natural reaction to the countrys economic woes is to miss its message of late.    Stocks are down in 11 of the last 12 sessions, and five straight days since the Obama budget was released. Thats not bobbing. Thats the market declaring a state of emergency.    Mr. Obama may want to chat with Jeff Immelt. Over the past year, Mr. Immelt has bought GE stock at $33, $15, and a few days back at $8.26. The shares now trade under $6.50.     So much for the contrarian buy. Mr. Obama, please take note.
