I agree with you. Labwire has held share price pretty well compared to some "blue chip" stocks. Citibank has lost around 98% of its value since its high. GE is 1/7th of its former self and the automakers are abysmal in the midst of the market meltdown. LBWR is obviously down but holding steady with new income streams coming on line. As Robct has pointed out, we're at three straight quarters of increasing revenue with the same predicted for the fourth quarter. It should be a nice quarter for longs.
