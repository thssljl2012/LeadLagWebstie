   QUOTE(axplayer &#064; Mar 23 2009, 08:22 AM)        I also meant to say that Vanguard is not an option where I work. The only choices are:  AIG, Fidelity, ING, Lincoln National Life Insurance Co., MetLife, and TIAA-CREF      axplayer, Go with fidelity or TC and do this yourself without that adviser. 1% seems reasonable, but then you have to add on the mutual fund fees and he or she will probably not set you up with lost cost funds. My guess you will be paying over 2% which puts you in a lot of market risk, because your funds have to grow that much more to pay the costs. Not a good idea.    Fidelity has the Sparten funds charging 10 basis points! Using Tony mix of funds, set up an allocation best for you, rebalance as you grow older, its a no brainer.   Steve
