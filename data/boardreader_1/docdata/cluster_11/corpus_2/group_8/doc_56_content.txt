      It looks like it could be a great time to invest.  For anyone who has a little extra money, what are you investing in?  Index funds, mutual funds, or individual stocks?  If you hit the right stock, there's a chance to make a lot of money, but finding the right one is the trick, isn't it?    I was tracking Bank of America, as I don't think banks will be nationalized, and I also don't think that the largest bank will be allowed to fail, but I'm not so confident any more.  Citigroup is hovering around &#036;1.  That might be worth a gamble.   Are there any other industries/companies that present a good gamble at this point that you're looking at or invested in?
