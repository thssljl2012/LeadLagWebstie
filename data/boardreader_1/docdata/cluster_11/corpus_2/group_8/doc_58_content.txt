 In the past investors would jump in when they see a bargain. This time there are not enough investors left to push the market higher. Look at the banks and other issues, under normal circumstances many will jump in to buy a company like American Express at less than $9 (Warren Buffet thought $28 for AXP was cheap and said he would buy at that price) and Bank of America at less than 4. Bombardier is now trading at a p/e of less than 4 - then why are investors not jumping? I suppose for the same reasons that they are not buying other bargains - there is not enough cash left with investors to do so.  No one would have imagined that the situation with the market could get that bad. BBD.B at $2.30? That would be a hell of a bargain under normal market conditions - I still think it is. I said I wouldn't add at $3.30 but at $2.30 it looks tempting. The C series will get orders - they will win large contracts in transportation and the CRJ1000 will be a winner for them. It is all a matter of time.
