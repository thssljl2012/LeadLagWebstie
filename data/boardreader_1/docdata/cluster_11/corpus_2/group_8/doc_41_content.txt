         According to this entry, Eddie did some manipulation, I mean, reinvesting during the second quarter of 2007....         http://www.stockpickr.com/port/Edward-Lampert/#contentTitle         He increased his holdings in Citibank by 62%, and reduced his holdings in Motorola by 32%.  I guess those new high interest credit cards will help ESL a lot more than they will help Sears Holdings!
