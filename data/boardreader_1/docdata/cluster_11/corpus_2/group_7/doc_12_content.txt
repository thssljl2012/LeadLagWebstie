Point 1.    I'd be interested on hearing views on the bad bank idea and how that may impact RBS share prices.    I don't know enough about the plan, but I guess if the government took over bad debts, they'd be no longer on the RBS books and the share price would respond positively?    It's still being considered apparently.     http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7868112.stm     Point 2    I've been watching BAC (Bank of America) for a week or two and the fear is they may get nationalized. The price went down 12% at one point yesterday on the back of these rumours. The game in the USA is much the same as here but the politics is different. What are the views of those here on whether Obama will decide to Nationalize BAC?
