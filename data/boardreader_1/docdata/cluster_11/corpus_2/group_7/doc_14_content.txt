Volcker, Nick Brady, and now Geithner are all advocating that model for fixing the current situation. &gt;&gt;    Does LatAm apply? LatAm debt was 315b when Mexico defaulted in 1982, but US Banks only held a fraction of that, probably well under 100b. That's 5-7% of assets vs. real estate today which represents almost 40% of US Bank assets.    More to the point, US Banks were able to leverage a growing US economy to offset LatAm losses. The consequences of boom-time lending and subsequent tightening in LatAm did not affect the banks' core US business. 'Ignore it and keep driving' works for a windshield washer fluid leak, but not for engine oil.    Of course the Swedish approach also has problems.      thread start
