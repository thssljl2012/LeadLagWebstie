I mean, the money has already been taxed, but I guess the gains on the money from now on would not be taxable as it's a Roth.                 A fund that trades foreign securities must pay taxes on gains/dividends to the respective governments.  So every year you hold a fund trading foreign securities you'll get a tax document showing foreign taxes paid (usually broken down by country).  If the fund is in an IRA/401K it's of little value other than trivia.  If the fund is held in a taxable account, when you file your taxes you can claim these paid foreign taxes as credit against tax owed.        A taxable account being an account you open at Bank of America/Vanguard/Fidelity/T.Rowe/wherever that lets you trade securities and is NOT an IRA/401K or other tax-deferred account.      If all your investing is going to be in tax-advantaged accounts (IRA or 401K Roth/Traditional) then don't worry about it.         At heart your concern is still one of market timing.  Anytime you buy, it could fall 20% afterwards; I'm not saying it's best for you to buy now, it's just that concern/possibility will always be there.  I expect a positive blip up in domestic markets after the stimulus bill is passed.  OPEC has signaled a production cut to get oil above $70, though it's unclear if they will be successful.  Financial markets will not appreciably improve until there is optimism amongst the investment community that the credit markets and banking situation is stable (6-18 months seems a popular guess right now).  I speculate a market rally will precede any recovery or real job creation, but as to when, that's a timing bet.
