         Seems to me that gold has proven itself a safe haven over last 12 months or so.  Gold has been rising since and perhaps a little before the beginning of 2003  --------  If you look at a longer period, there are plenty of times when its done the complete opposite.  If it truely were a safe investment, that wouldn't be the case. It would reflect inflation.  Saying its a safe haven, is actually saying something about the general economy. i.e. That the gold price is negatively correlated with other assets.  Again, I'm not sure you can say that.
