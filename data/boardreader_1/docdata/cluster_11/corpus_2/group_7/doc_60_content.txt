Re: January Results Well such as it is, at least we've had a little recovery... I think I mentioned a few weeks ago that I'm using dividends received to fund additional purchases. As is obvious from my 2 Buys of Citibank, we've not reached the bottom. I just hope it is too big to fail as I've been hearing. It is a roll of the dice for sure, but not a lot of $ on the table. February is going pretty well too. GIEW is +8% after the first week and I've already had 1 Sell. I've plowed half of those proceeds into a Buy on another holding so that I can 'spread the wealth' so to speak. BTW: Welcome to those newbies who have joined out little group recently. Stick with it. It will work out.
