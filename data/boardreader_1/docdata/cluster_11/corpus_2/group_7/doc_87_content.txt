         Seems to me that gold has proven itself a safe haven over last 12 months or so.  What else has held its value?  I thought platinum would fare better but it is proven to be just another commodity like oil going up and down in value with supply and demand.  Gold has few practical uses but is still forms a key part of western bank reserves?? Gold is an idiosyncratic even eccentric investment but gold is.... well, gold!!
