Good evening    A bullish pattern has developed and a BUY alert has been signalled today, ie 12/2.  However, the validity of this bullish pattern now needs to be confirmed!  A good starting point may be to keep an eye on after-hours future trading and world stock markets, to get preliminary hints about the direction of the UK market, and these should also be closely followed prior to the UK confirmation session. (ie tomorrow 13/2/2009)......    1) HSBC Liffe futures that expire 28/3/2009 - up 1.3%, session now closed    2) NYSE:HBC (USA) now turned positive 21.00 GMT up 1.0% at market close. (bucking trend as Citicorp and Bank Of America down 3 &amp; 2% respectively) Plus DOW finished only 6 points down reversing a 200 + point decline at session lows. If DOW futures up before UK start at 8 am, treat as positive.      3) HSBC Holdings HK -confirm tomorrow morning prior to UK market open    There are two possible cases of this BUY confirmation. You have to follow the next session carefully to check if these cases will hold or not:     1) The market opens with an upward gap, signaling a bullish sentiment in the first case. Your benchmark will be the opening price. If the prices stay over the benchmark, go LONG.     2) In the second case, the market opens at a level, equal to or below the previous day&#146;s close. The benchmark is that closing price. If prices during the session stay over the benchmark, go LONG.     SHORT positions are NOT suggested given the bullish alert. The SHORT sellers should consider covering their positions if the market confirms the BUY signal.     NB, this is not advice, and always DYOR.    Hope this helps.    Triple Witcher
