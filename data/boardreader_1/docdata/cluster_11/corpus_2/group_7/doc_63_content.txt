         All, As regards the cost basis there is a risk premium here that the Street is providing.  The biggest risk right now is that the dividend will be cut and, frankly, I can't put a number on the likelihood that WFC will do this.  I reiterate that one of my investment theseses these days is how is the business doing in what is truly a challenging environment.  Relatively speaking the numbers that WFC has reported (ie, loan originations, revenue) suggest business is OK.  Not great, but OK and how could this be otherwise these days even for good companies.  If an investor with a long term horizon is reinvesting the dividends, this is taking care of the  cost basis in a fairly painless way that is remarkebly tax efficient.  Right now I'm taking what the Street is giving me, but I'm also being watchful.  On a weakly related subject as we all know Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch where I have my investmewnt accounts.  B of A's CEO is on the front of the latest edition of the monthly magazine I get from Merrill.  That picture and his self serving comments in an article in the magazine just made my blood boil.  He might be a fine individual, but what a worthless CEO.  I don't have similar feelings about WFC.
