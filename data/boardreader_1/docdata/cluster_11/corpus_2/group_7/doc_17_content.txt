         I think the good times of the past decade or so have fooled many people that gold and silver are more like industrial commodities than money. The simple reason for this is that the entire world believed the US were a trustworthy economic superpower and so the dollar become the worlds reserve currency. A propaganda miracle and an amazing confidence trick. Now we know that the US is as fallible as any other country economically, and are now printing money like some tin pot banana republic. Fiat money across the globe will expand as everyone tries to devalue their currencies. The dollars in the central banks accross the world will become more worthless as its buying power decreases. Imagine how the Chinese must feel. Decades of busting their asses in exchange for a shitload of paper. I doubt they will want more of that. As long as the myth of American economic supremacy was believed the dollar was good but now its back to reality. Gold, Silver, oil and physical commodities.  Perhaps I've watched to many videos by Peter Schiff, Jim Rogers and Marc Faber but I'm uber bearish on the world economy and to my mind gold, silver and oil are the places to be. Probably land too. Silver has some catch up to do as it goes through a transition from industrial commodity to real money. Silvers demise in comparative value with gold was, I believe, due too the misguided confidence in the dollar which temporarily took away the need for a more durable means of value exchange but I think silver will make a come back.  Coming off the gold standard was a massive mistake IMO.  Anyway, good luck whatever your beliefs.
