 OK time to forget the dating thread, time to think about Warren Buffett (is that prounounced boofay?) plunging $300m into Harley.     That is ooohhh what, around 200 million of Brit cash?     If I was Harley, I would feel the noose tightening around my neck...     Further cements Triumph's strong Independent position perhaps?     Here it is, from the trusted BBC...        Harley-Davidson gains $600m boost          Harley-Davidson is cutting production by up 13% in 2009       Motorcycle firm Harley-Davidson has secured a $600m (418m) cash injection, including $300m from billionaire investor Warren Buffett.    The funds will help the iconic US firm improve its cash base, after losses in its financing arm saw it post a 58% fall in profit for October to December.   The other $300m comes from investment group Davis Selected Advisers (DSA), Harley-Davidson's biggest shareholder.   Harley-Davidson announced last month that it is cutting 1,100 jobs.   This represents more than 12% of its workforce. It is also trimming production by up to 13% this year.    Generous interest    The announcement of the fresh investment saw shares in the Milwaukee-based company rise as much as 23%.   Mr Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company and DSA will be paid an annual interest of 15% for their investment.   It is just the latest big investment made by Mr Buffett, 78, as the US economic downturn has worsened.   Towards the end of last year he bought $5bn of shares in US bank Goldman Sachs, which also needed additional funds to improve its finances. "Harley's finance arm needs capital in a highly constrained credit environment," said Ed Aaron, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "We knew capital would be available at a price."
