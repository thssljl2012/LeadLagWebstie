 Precious Metals Message Board Posts          Recs: 3              Re: 'Paper gold market will crash at Comex'        Marc Gugerli: The majority of investors purchase Paper-(Gold)-Futures at the COMEX. The sellers or counterparties of those Gold-Futures   are just a few very dominant players. Some of them have an in-official close link to the US government.   So far most of the investors didn&#8217;t exercise the gold futures and have accepted cash instead of physical settlement.       This is about to change. I believe that the comex will default and the entire paper gold market will &#8222;crash&#8220; and gold could rise very quickly to 2000 until 3000 US Dollars. When this happens it will be too late to exercise or to try purchasing physical gold. It&#8217;s the same with a house insurance, which you need before the beds are burning!        Yep .. that's what worries me !    For example , the Hunt brothers bought loads of Silver on margin, i.e. loans from their bank.  The story goes that JPM in particular had a massive short position on Silver and was in danger of BK'ing.  So the FED joined in to rescue them .. telling the banks to cut the Hunt Brother's credit lines , which resulted in the price of Silver crashing .. and BK'ing Hunt brothers .    OK, this time on Gold, we have JPM, GS and another big US bank with big short positions .  How many of the Long paper-gold holders are on margin , I don't know.  ..... just hope they're not , and are requesting physical delivery !      Bottom line : it wouldn't surprise to see the FED play some tricks here .. just to make sure Gold does embarrass the fiat paper !              thread start
