Do you honestly think MTRE is immune is from what is happening in today's markets? Do you think that just because there is no BAD news that MTRE cannot succumb to the needs of investors to raise cash when the need arises, despite the long-term outlook? MTRE will rise on its own merits, despite the current market environment the United States finds itself in. They are no more immune to what is happening than are these household names: Rubbermaid (NWL) 52wk low @ $7.16 today ($24.16 52wk high) ALCOA (AA) 52wk low @ $6.75 today ($44.77 52wk high) Bank of America (BAC) closed @ $4.90 versus a $43.50 52wk high AIG (AIG) 52wk low @ $0.75 today ($52.25 52wk high) and so many more that could be listed.......The DOW is now down 46% from its high, and probably will fall even more before bottoming out. Yes, there are penny stocks that are currently running.....from what? Rumors? Pump &amp; Dumps? Momo plays simply instigated by bands of traders right here @ IHUB? MTRE is a solid play, one that doesn't require babysitting, and when this crazy market finally settles down, reality will once again take over, and people will invest in good, safe, undervalued stocks..........like MTRE I have said it many times before. MTRE is NOT a daytrader's dream nor a flipper's paradise. If that is what you are looking for, pick a different stock....... JMHO
