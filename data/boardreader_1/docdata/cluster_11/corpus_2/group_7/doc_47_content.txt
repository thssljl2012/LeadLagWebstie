 ELN Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              OT: Fidelity     http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=asmu2saPk9F4&amp;refer=home     &lt;Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Fidelity Investments, the worlds largest mutual-fund company, more than doubled its stake in Citigroup Inc. in the fourth quarter, ahead of a 61 percent slide in the stock this year.     Fidelity bought 104 million shares of Citigroup in the quarter ended Dec. 31, bringing its stake in the bank to 171 million shares, or 3.1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Boston-based firm is the sixth-biggest holder of Citigroup, the data show.     Citigroup posted a record $18.7 billion loss last year, forcing it to seek a $52 billion government bailout. The stock fell as much as 14 percent today to $2.50, the lowest since Dec. 12, 1991. New York-based Citigroup and the biggest U.S. banks have tumbled this year on concerns that mounting losses from mortgage-related securities will force regulators to step in and nationalize them. The KBW Bank Index is down 49 percent.     It was just a horrible move, said Jim Lowell, chief strategist at Adviser Investments in Watertown, Massachusetts, and editor of Fidelity Investor, a newsletter. Lowell said a number of Fidelity managers increased their holdings of financial stocks in October on the assumption that the worst was over for the group.     Fidelity also added shares of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in the fourth quarter. JPMorgan shares are down 32 percent this year; Wells Fargo shares are down 58 percent. Fidelity owns 4 percent of JPMorgan and 5.2 percent of Wells Fargo. Fidelity cut its holdings in Bank of America Corp., bringing its stake to 2.2 percent.     Fidelitys strong suit is not deep-value investing, said Christopher Davis, a fund analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. There is a chance that many of these financial companies wont make it. &gt;  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Some pro KM people on this board cited the facts that Fido is 1) up to its ears on elan (ie 15% or so)  and 2) didn't trim too much , is proof that Fido must trust/believe in KM and/or believe in the potential of eln pipeline ...    Well, it is seems that Fido is way deep in a lot of loser stocks other than elan. Hence the above argument does not mean much to me.
