Dew , This might surprise you. """" As of last nights close (January 20), The DJIA had the following stocks less than $10 Citi (C) = $2.80, GM (GM) = $3.50, B of A (BAC) = $5.10, Alcoa (AA) = $8.35 If all four of these stocks went to zero on todays open, the DJIA would lose only 157.3 points."""""" Because the Dow Jones industrial average is a "price-weighted" index, companies with high share prices carry proportionally more weight than those with low ones. Instead of IBM accounting for one-30th of the Dow's overall price, these days it accounts for more than 9 percent because of its shares' relatively high price of $96.14. Normally, this isn't a big deal; since the index tracks the performance of leading companies in American economic life, its 30 component stocks tend to have stable, mid-double-digit share prices. But over the last year, some of the companies in the DJIA have settled to the bottom of the blue-chip barrel. Four now trade for less than $10 a share -- Alcoa ($8.40), Bank of America ($6.13), Citi ($3.91), and General Motors ($2.84). With the exception of J.P. Morgan Chase ($27.63), the index's remaining financials -- American Express and, if you really want to be inclusive, General Electric -- both trade for under $20 apiece. As James Bianco of Bianco Research observed last month, all seven of the companies in this paragraph combined carry less weight in the index than IBM does alone. In practice, this has reduced the Dow's financial and automotive companies to statistical lightweights. While the two industries are massively important to the American economy and the stock market's overall performance, the Dow affords the sectors far less clout than they carry in "market-weighted" indexes like the S&amp;P 500. To use an extreme example, GM and Citi now trade at a combined $6.79. If both were to drop to zero, the Dow Jones Industrial Average would drop by less than 50 points.
