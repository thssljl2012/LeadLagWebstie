We remain right where jr indicated with bounce needed soon or bail out imminent.       Look what happened just since Tuesday afternoon when I put out a few price targets for this week.  DOW breached but S&amp;P fighting to hold 780 level and financials tanked. Today felt just like Wednesday, like ground hogs day.  I may have gone too early on SSO and FLR, but not down much yet.    We learn that SSO at 19.50 when S&amp;P is 780.  If S&amp;P goes to 750 Nov. low I plan to double down on my 400 SSO in my IRA.  I project that would be about $18.00 on SSO.  I sold my SSO trading block on the gap up this a.m. for $100 profit.   If S&amp;P breaches 740 I am bailing, selling SSO, FLR and PRAA (still have stop to protect profit) in my IRA to move to 90% cash.  Now about 70% cash in IRA,     FLR 38 now, still in 100 trading, 200 IRA, may add at 36 to avg. down if it gets there tomorrow, but will put a tight stop or watch to dump on brink of cliff fall off should that occur.    BAC - Wow, went from $5 on Tuesday post, to $4.51 Wed and now under $4 right to target.  Will it be Bank of America or Barack of America with nationalized banks, thoughts anyone?   If it gaps down on the open, I am going to buy some, not betting the ranch though.    DXO - Got down to $1.75 but glad to see you guys finally caught a break on the oil futures.  Wonder if 1 day or a rally from here though.    Anyone have a prediction for tomorrow and Monday?      thread start
