 Thanks for the link and information on Vanguard Equity Income.  That's a good reminder that actively managed funds also have limitations and management restrictions.  It can also be difficult to sell large positions in a down market.        With a company like Bank of America which is down at least 75% from its high, it may be very tempting to hold on to the stock.  The company has big earnings power that should come back in due time.  Selling now would lock in a substantial loss.        An alternative to the Dividend Fund and ETF might be a Utility Fund or Utility ETF.  That eliminates the exposure to Financial firms, and Utility Stocks have held up relatively well.  There is quite a selection starting with the XLU.        There are also Closed End Funds trading at a discount to NAV such as UTF.  It has an 8.47% yield and is selling at a 12.58% discount to NAV.  A buyer would need to be comfortable with a leveraged fund.
