Any banks that will need any more money (maybe WFC, JPM?) will get so much dilution that they will trade like FRE, FNM, AIG, etc.  No matter how you slice it, the government's intervention will kill the common stock.  But because they are committed to keeping these companies private (as opposed to nationalization), the common will just trade like the GSEs and AIG.         IMO, the market's expectation of the bank rescue plan is going to rally banks and give an opportunity to sell what you have in bank stocks and think about buying SKF or FAZ.  Even though the banks seem like buys here, they are not.  Their ability to make money going forward is limited--at least for the next several years.
