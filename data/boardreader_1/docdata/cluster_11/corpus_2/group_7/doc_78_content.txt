While what your saying is correct, those are in fact all Pinksheet Stocks, with the .PK extension and all legitimate companies, they are also ALL International Stocks. They ALL include the "Y" as the Fifth Indicator in the symbol. The "Y" refers to: Y- ADR (American Depositary Receipt) (http://www.stockmaven.com/symbols.htm) What Does American Depositary Receipt - ADR Mean? A negotiable certificate issued by a U.S. bank representing a specified number of shares (or one share) in a foreign stock that is traded on a U.S. exchange. ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars, with the underlying security held by a U.S. financial institution overseas. ADRs help to reduce administration and duty costs that would otherwise be levied on each transaction. (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp) This therefore should help investors/traders understand that these legitimate companies are not your typical Pinksheet stocks and simply can't be fairly compared to such IMO.
