         Mark to market means it can go up or down. Some read it as only down. What will they say when it is valued up? Once again those who don`t know rule the day as it is much easier to short at the moment. But like Bank of America it will shoot up and catch them out. How can it have market cap of around 9b with profits as declared? P/e ratio just about 2. Talk about value investing? Looks like the Arabs know more than we do.
