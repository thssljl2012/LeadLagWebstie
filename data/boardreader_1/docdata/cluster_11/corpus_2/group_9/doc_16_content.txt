U.S. stock futures drop as DuPont, Merck cut view By Steve Goldstein, MarketWatch Last update: 7:54 a.m. EDT April 21, 2009 LONDON (MarketWatch) -- U.S. stock futures on Tuesday dropped as blue chips DuPont, Merck and Caterpillar cut their 2009 profit or sales estimates in a largely bleak wave of earnings reports. After early gains, S&amp;P 500 futures fell 6.3 points to 826.60 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 7.5 points to 1,306.00. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 65 points. Worries over Bank of America's outlook and the banking sector more generally drove a retreat in U.S. stocks on Monday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 289 points, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 37 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell 74 points. Richard Cookson, head of asset allocation research at HSBC, said investors may have got too enthusiastic in the first place. "Banks are able to suspend some of their mark-to-market (accounting) for their existing portfolio, which has a rather flattering effect on profits. One of the things that spooked people yesterday was comments about a rise in loan losses," he said. "Corporate profits are under severe pressure, simply extrapolating the fact that the economy may be over the worst to say corporate profits will jump is a stretch. They're going to fall hard this year."
