I have been giving Lloy some thought following my exchange with Garbled yesterday.    Garbled predicted a 150 sp this week and noted that Lloy seem to be the darling of UK banks recently. I saw legs this week but yesterdays fallout from BoA and Citi and renewed pessimism directed towards the US bank sector have dashed my optimism even for the rest of the week ahead.    I ask myself why this bank is outperforming now?    Unlike Barc there is a deafening silence from the company recently, post APS inclusion. There is talk of a RI and discussion as to means of payment for the APS. AGM has been postponed and no forseeable news release.    Is no news good news? In this case, probably.    Why has the Lloy sp appreciated materially in recent weeks? I am lost for an explanation.    The company still has large exposures to the US and UK housing markets, which are still relatively stagnant. They will certainly experience sizable writedowns this year. Yes, HMG will not let them fall but this does not justify short term upside until the recession reverses and world financial markets recover.    Yes, the enlarged group does have increased weight in the UK retail banking market going forward, but does this justify a 100+ sp in the current climate? I fail to see many plus points for this company in the short term.    Long term, once they sort out and have paid their APS financing and return to paying dividends, i can see a solid entity evolving.    For this week, Lloy shareholders (of which i am one as of eysterday morning (regrets, regrets!) should hope that the sp can survive 2 days of banking concerns and count on Barc doing them a favour again on Thursday. I need 107+ to get into profit on my shareholding and will get out fast on Thursday or Friday if we surpass this mark.    It would be good to hear reasoned answers from Lloy stalwarts to my points above, posted by a newbie to this particular bb.    Good luck to all this week and forward.    Z.
