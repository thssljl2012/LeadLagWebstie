I have mostly mutual funds and they've dropped about 1/3 from the highs - a little less - so I figure I'm doing ok.  Now they're starting to turn around.  Funds and ETF's are the way to go, but look at the expenses charged.  Things like DXO (double short crude oil) charge huge fees, but you can still make out if you've guessed the market correctly (yeah, right!).      For funds, it depends on what you pick.  I go for long term growth, combination of value &amp; dividends and medium grade, high yield paper.      Right now might be a very good time to get in, but people were also saying this 4 months ago and we saw what happened.  Oh yeah, Citibank at $20 is a freakin' steal!!!  Yup.      I'm buying call options rather than stocks outright.  If your wrong about the market, you lose a lot less.  And if you're right, you make out as well as owning the stock.  But since I don't like trying to time the market, I go with the 2011 leaps - the 2010's if they're the longest available.      The market is so volatile that you can put in a bid for an option that is 2/3 of the current bid and in a couple weeks, there's a good chance you'll get it.      Whatever you do though, stop loss orders, trailing stops, etc. are your friends!
