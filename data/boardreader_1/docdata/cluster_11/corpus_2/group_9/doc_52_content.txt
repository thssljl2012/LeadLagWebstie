         I'm doing a paper on Citibank and their current woes for a finance class for my MBA. Need some help finding the amount of reserves and secondary reserves that they hold. Anyone know where I can find this stuff to do a ratio analysis.   Either that, or a website or publication that gives me the reserves to assets ratio and the secondary reserves to assets ratio would be fine too.  Thanks in advance
