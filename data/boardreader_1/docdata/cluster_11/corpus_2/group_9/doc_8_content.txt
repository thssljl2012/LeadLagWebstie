Market Update 090421 http://biz.yahoo.com/mu/update.html 4:35 pm : Uninspired by the latest batch of earnings announcements, bulls initially yielded control of stocks to sellers for the second straight session. However, the early decline in stocks compelled buyers looking for more attractive entry prices to move in and offer their support. That helped stocks rebound midmorning and climb higher for the rest of the session. Financials attracted the most support. The sector was down more than 1% in the early going, but finished with an 8.2% gain at its best levels of the session. Buying in the sector was broad-based, but US Bancorp (USB 19.27, +3.33) provided some of the most positive influence to diversified banks (+13.6%) and the overall financial sector after it reported better-than-expected first quarter earnings. Meanwhile, Regions Financial (RF 6.14, +0.34) attracted buyers into regional banks (+6.9%) after holding an upbeat conference call. The stock was initially sent lower after the company announced a small profit for the latest quarter. Shares of RF swung nearly 28% from their session low to their closing price. Buying among financials also helped lift investment services stocks. State Street (STT 36.15, +5.50) surged after topping earnings estimates, but even Bank of New York (BK 27.98, -0.05) and Northern Trust (NTRS 56.17, -1.98) were able to pare losses after both falling short of analysts' expectations. Semiconductors (+3.3%) were supported when Texas Instruments (TXN 17.11, -0.21) reported better-than-expected results and indicated that demand has begun to stabilize. Dow components IBM (IBM 102.31, +1.88), Coca-Cola (KO 43.09, -1.24), Caterpillar (CAT 31.39, +0.91), DuPont (DD 28.06, +1.32), Merck (MRK 23.54, -1.68), and United Technologies (UTX 47.99, +2.18) all issued quarterly results for participants to digest. The results were generally mixed, leaving the blue chip average to trail the other headline indices for virtually the entire session. Still, the Dow managed to close with a solid gain. Small-cap stocks saw some of the strongest gains. The Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index tacked on 3.9% this session. Emulex (ELX 9.70, +3.09) was a primary leader among small-cap stocks. Its gain came after the company received an offer from Broadcom (BRCM 20.52, -1.27) to be acquired for about $764 million. Airlines also made a strong performance by climbing 10.0% after Delta Air Lines (DAL 8.11, +1.30) reported a first quarter loss that wasn't quite as bad as feared. Educational services stocks were absent from this session's advance. Prior to the opening bell, analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded several service providers. The group fell 7.0%. Health care stocks also lagged. Health care was the only sector to finish in the red; it closed 0.9% lower. United Health (UNH 22.80, -1.41) and Schering-Plough (SGP 22.11, -0.94) both were laggards, despite better-than-expected earnings. There were no economic reports today, but Treasury Secretary Geithner spoke before a congressional committee. He indicated that there was still about $109.6 billion available from the $700 billion rescue package passed last year, and he expects to get at least an additional $25 billion back, bringing the total to $134.6 billion.DJ30 +127.83 NASDAQ +35.64 NQ100 +1.5% R2K +3.9% SP400 +3.1% SP500 +17.69 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 2021/1.94 bln/671 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2409/1.67 bln/634 3:30 pm : June crude oil hit session lows early in the morning at $46.72 per barrel. The futures rose throughout the session and managed to close at $48.47 per barrel, down just $0.04. May crude oil expired at the close; the contracts finished trading at $46.64 per barrel. Natural gas futures opened near session lows of $3.45 per contract, much like crude oil did this session. The May contracts recovered and were able to close the session down just shy of 0.8% at $3.51 per contract. Precious metals opened the pit session with considerable momentum from yesterday's gains. The contracts were not able to extend yesterday's rally, though, as equity markets attracted bids and the U.S. dollar failed to match yesterday's rally. June gold opened at a session high of $896.40 per ounce but traded down during the session to close at $882.70, down 0.5%. July silver futures contracts also trended down during the session. The futures contracts closed at $12.09 per ounce down 0.5%.DJ30 +113.41 NASDAQ +28.96 SP500 +15.44 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1967/2.0 bln/708 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2339/1.2 bln/694 3:00 pm : The stock market continues to trade with a strong gain, but has been unable to build on its advance as resistance surfaces at the 845 level. With the stock market still trading near that level and only one hour left in the session, participants are watching closely to see whether stocks can muster enough momentum to push higher into the close. With the close in sight, participants are preparing for the next batch of earnings announcements. Capital One Financial (COF 14.82, +1.44), Gilead Sciences (GILD 43.94, +0.17), and Yahoo! (YHOO 14.21, +0.55) are all scheduled to report their latest quarterly earnings results after the closing bell. On average, Wall Street expects Capital One to post a loss of $0.08 per share, Gilead to report earnings of $0.59 per share, and Yahoo! to unveil earnings of $0.08 per share. Tomorrow morning will be replete with more earnings reports. Morgan Stanley (MS 24.56, +1.04) will headline the announcements. Wells Fargo (WFC 18.25, +1.25) will also garner strong attention as investors await additional commentary and insights from the company's management to supplement Wells Fargo's preannounced results, which were unveiled last week. Altria (MO 16.68, -0.25), AT&amp;T (T 25.25, -0.04), Boeing (BA 36.23, -0.25), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 40.42, +1.31), Genzyme (GENZ 54.41, +0.08), Northrop Grumman (NOC 47.00, +0.00), St. Jude Medical (STJ 33.92, -1.47), and WellPoint (WLP 41.32, -0.11) are also scheduled to announce.DJ30 +85.38 NASDAQ +19.31 SP500 +11.20 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1894/1.84 bln/754 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2263/1.08 bln/720 2:30 pm : Educational services stocks have been noticeably absent from this session's advance. Prior to the opening bell, analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded shares of Apollo Group (APOL 60.92, -4.85), Lincoln Educational (LINC 15.13, -1.89), and ITT Educational (ESI 99.79, -7.08). The premise behind the downgrade largely argued that a more challenging regulatory environment could hinder longer-term growth. The argument is also tainting shares of Corinthian Colleges (COCO 16.21, -1.79) and Career Education (CECO 20.50, -1.64) in this session's trade.DJ30 +80.92 NASDAQ +19.29 SP500 +10.56 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1844/1.69 bln/784 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2244/1.00 bln/755 2:00 pm : Small-cap stocks are snapping back after seeing intense selling pressure in the prior session. The Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index fell more than 5% Monday, but it is currently up 2.3% this session. Emulex (ELX 9.46, +2.83) is a primary leader among small-cap stocks this session. Its outsized gain comes after the company received an offer from Broadcom (BRCM 19.86, -1.93) to be acquired for about $764 million.DJ30 +77.97 NASDAQ +20.30 SP500 +11.37 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1848/1.56 bln/756 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2243/930 mln/767 1:30 pm : Stocks are taking a breather by pulling back a bit after recently registering session highs. Gains remain broad-based, though. The Volatility Index, or VIX, is down 4.7% to roughly 37.4 this session. It had crossed 40 during the prior session, which was the first time in more than one week that it breached that level. However, its spike of 15.4% on Monday was the highest single-session move by percent since January.DJ30 +62.76 NASDAQ +19.63 SP500 +8.53 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1828/1.45 bln/762 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2194/865 mln/798 1:05 pm : Stocks started the session in the red as participants looked to extend the prior session's losses amid a mixed batch of earnings reports from several widely held companies. However, a bid for financials has surfaced to carry the broader market to an impressive gain. Financials fell to a loss in excess of 1% in the first few minutes of action, but are now trading with a 5.1% gain, near session highs. The turnaround comes amid leadership from JPMorgan Chase (JPM 31.49, +1.80) and Wells Fargo (WFC 18.50, +1.50). US Bancorp (USB 18.23, +2.29) is also showing strength after the diversified bank reported better-than-expected first quarter earnings. Shares of diversified banks are currently up 10%. Regional banks have also overcome considerable selling pressure to trade with a gain of 4.6%. Regions Financial (RF 6.25, +0.45) started the session as a primary laggard after posting a small profit for the first quarter, but garnered support in the wake of an upbeat conference call. Investment services stocks are mixed, however. Bank of New York (BK 25.73, -2.30) missed expected earnings, State Street (STT 33.45, +2.80) topped estimates, and Northern Trust (NTRS 53.23, -4.92) fell short of the consensus earnings forecast. Prior to the financial sector's rebound, large-cap tech was showing the most promise. Strength among large-cap tech stocks came as investors reacted positively to better-than-expected first quarter results and upbeat guidance from IBM (IBM 101.73, +1.30). Texas Instruments (TXN 17.17, -0.15) reported better-than-expected results of its own, along with an in-line earnings outlook for the second quarter. Management helped bolster confidence in a turnaround by indicating that demand has begun to stabilize. Health care stocks are lagging this session. United Health (UNH 22.91, -1.30) is seeing selling pressure despite better-than-expected earnings. Schering-Plough (SGP 22.17, -0.88) is also down despite better-than-expected earnings. Dow component Merck (MRK 23.76, -1.46) missed earnings expectations, though. Fellow Dow component DuPont (DD 27.82, +1.08) topped the consensus earnings estimate and issued in-line guidance for 2009.
