like you im staying at cash, there are stress test results tomorrow but they are likely to be a no-win, either the results will be bad sending the SP down, or the results will be good suggesting to the markets that the tests arnt stressful enough sending the SP down.  Thats how the markets analysed the US bank profit results.
