    &lt;&lt;Looks as of the Street expects BAC to issue Common shares for the Pfd "at its book value" &lt;=[ Huh??] on the date it the pfd were issued. That would really benifit BAC, However since the Bank already exceeds the Stress test bar , I don't believe it will happen&gt;&gt;         Where do you get that they "expect" the conversion would be at Book Value and not the current stock market value?         The Fed's should be forced to take that kind of haircut after the sh*t they pulled / did to BAC, but that's not the question.         Why would the Fed take such a loss when they have the control??         In Citi they forced a Big % haircut down the throats of the converted pfds, but that wasn't what they had to eat. They won't eat it here either.         If this were to be, i would think it would be a straight forward market value approach conversion where the Feds also got a discount on that value, due to the impact on value for the dilution.         If so, dilution could be a significant %, but if that's what was needed to be to put BAC back to where it should be capitalized at to suceed, then i would think it would be good for the stability and price for the stock on a long-term basis.          Personally, i'd much rather see the Fed continue to lend on the cheap &amp; let the backs earn their way back, but they haven't yet asked me what i want.          Hey, i'm not against a BV conversion, but, seriously, imo, you have more chances of the Feds reimbursing BAC for its ML losses than ever seeing that happen, lols.         jmo    M    msg 4694
