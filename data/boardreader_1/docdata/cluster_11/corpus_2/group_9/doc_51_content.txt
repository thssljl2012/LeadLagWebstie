Citi Reports $4.69 Billion in Fixed Income Trading   By Dan Denning &#8226; April 20th, 2009 &#8226; Related Articles &#8226; Filed Under    http://www.dailyreckoning.com.au/citi-reports-469-billion-in-fixed-income-trading/2009/04/20/   We'll see if the rally in Aussie shares can keep on keeping on this week. We  have our doubts. Not least because the optimism surrounding bank share is not  only misplaced. It's naive.   So the banks have returned to profitability have they? That was the theme on  the market last week. And if it were true, a recovery in bank balance sheets is  just the sort of thing that might precede a recovery in the economy. But it  probably isn't true. Here's why...   The big three banks reporting last week-Citibank, Goldman Sachs, and JP  Morgan-all reported huge revenues from their trading desks. As we reported last  week, Goldman's $6.6 billion in trading revenues was not only 70% of total  revenues, but it was also a ten billion dollar improvement on a $4 billion loss  in the fourth quarter.   JP Morgan reported nearly $5 billion in revenues from fixed income securities  trading. And Citigroup reported $4.69 billion in fixed income trading. In fact,  all of Citigroup's other major operating segments reported declining revenues  for the quarter. Its global credit card revenues fell by 10%. Consumer banking  revenues were down 18%. And Citi's Global Wealth Management revenues were down  20%.   But something magic happened in the fixed income trading group for Citi. This  is pure gold if you like arcane financial statements packed with fictional  earnings. If you dig into the quarterly report, you'll learn than fixed income  trading revenues were boosted by a "net $2.5 billion positive CVA on derivative  positions, excluding monoclines, mainly due to the widening of Citi's CDS  spread.   That takes some sorting out. A CVA is a "credit value  adjustment." As you can learn here, it's the credit  risk premium of a derivative contract. Once you sort it out, you learn that Citi  "made" $2.5 billion on a derivatives position designed to profit when the  companies own credit default swaps spreads widen.   Or, in plain English, Citi profited because it made a bet  that the cost of insuring itself against a default would go up. The credit  default swap market is the place where you can bet on the credit worthiness of a  firm, or, essentially, the chance that a firm might default on its bonds. Citi  appears to have reported a $2.5 billion trading gain in the fourth quarter  precisely because the market thought the company stood a good chance of failing  (hence the widening CDS spread).   As far as we can tell, if you use this kind of perverted  logic, the closer Citi gets to bankruptcy, the more money it would "make" on its  derivatives. That shows you how bogus the quarterly number was. The company  reported declining revenues in its core banking and lending activities. But  thanks to fixed income and this handy $2.5 billion CVA, the company was able to  report $1.5 billion in net income.   Also, don't forget that all of the banks benefitted from what financial  sector analyst Meredith Whitney called "back door financing." Whitney described what amounts to  Fed-sanctioned front-running of the fixed income market by the banks. The Fed  publicly telegraphed its intention to buy $750 billion mortgage backed  securities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and $300 billion in U.S. Treasury  bonds. And that was AFTER it announced in late November of last year it would be  wading in as a buyer for all agency bonds to support the U.S. mortgage  market.   Since the financial statements of the banks don't break trading re
