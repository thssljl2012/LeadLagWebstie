NEW YORK - Wall Street extended its rally into a second day Wednesday as financial stocks padded their own big gains.  If investors keep buying, they'll give the stock market its first back-to-back advance since Feb. 5-6. But analysts were again cautioning that the market remains deeply troubled by the ongoing problems in the banking industry and the impact of the recession on companies in all industries.  'It's rare to see large gains follow large gains,' said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments. 'What we would find encouraging is getting a bounce that holds. That would suggest that we may be at the beginning of a rebound.'  Financial stocks were again leading the market. Bank of America Corp. was up more than 12 percent, and Citigroup Inc., whose profit news gave the market its best day of 2009 on Tuesday, was up more than 14 percent.  Tech stocks also rose sharply, giving the Nasdaq composite index a boost.  There was little economic and corporate news expected Wednesday that could help influence the market.  'To a certain extent, the market's on its own,' Gayle said.  The catalyst for Tuesday's rally was word that Citigroup has been operating at a profit so far this year. News of the improved performance was a welcome reprieve from the flood of bad news that has slammed bank stocks and the broader market for months. And it did make investors optimistic that the first quarter might not be as bad as expected.  But Tuesday's advance was also fed by short covering, which occurs when investors need to buy stock to replace shares that were borrowed and then sold on expectations of a market decline.  In morning trading Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.26, or 0.6 percent, to 6,967.75. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 7.88, or 1.1 percent, to 727.48, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 21.28, or 1.6 percent, to 1,130.03.  The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 6.73, or 1.8 percent, to 374.48.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 290.3 million shares.  Citigroup jumped 20 cents, or 13.5 percent, to $1.65, while Bank of America added 50 cents, or 10.4 percent, to $5.29.  Apple Inc. rose $3.97, or 4.5 percent, to $92.60 after announcing a new version of its iPod shuffle.  Staples Inc. said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit dropped 14 percent amid a number of charges related to an acquisition. The office products retailer reported a 16 percent jump in sales. But both sales and adjusted earnings missed Wall Street expectations. Shares fell 27 cents to $15.47.  Bond prices were mixed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, was unchanged from late Tuesday at 3 percent. The yield on the three-month T-bill, considered one of the safest investments, slipped to 0.23 percent from 0.24 percent late Tuesday.  The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices rose slightly.  Light, sweet crude fell 89 cents to $44.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average jumped 4.55 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 2.02 percent. In afternoon trading, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.60 percent, Germany's DAX index rose 2.34 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.88 percent.
