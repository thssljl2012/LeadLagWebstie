Wall St rebounds from 12-year lows Buoyed by positive Citi outlook  WALL Street soared overnight in an explosive rally after troubled banking giant Citigroup's upbeat profit outlook prompted a buying frenzy that lifted beaten-down stocks.  The Dow Jones vaulted more than 373 points, or 5.7 per cent to 6920.44 at the closing bell, as blue chips rebounded strongly from 12-year lows a day earlier.  The tech-dominated Nasdaq leapt 89 points, or more than 7 per cent to 1358.28 while the S&amp;P500 index rallied more than 6 per cent to a preliminary close of 719.14.  The rebound came as an internal memo showed struggling US banking giant Citigroup is seeing a return to profitability in early 2009 after punishing losses last year.  Chief executive Vikram Pandit said Citi has been profitable for the first two months of 2009 and was having its 'best quarter-to-date performance since the third quarter of 2007'. 'Wall Street was in dire need of some good news, and Citigroup delivered,' said Joseph Hargett at Schaeffer's Investment Research.  Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com said the market seized on what would ordinarily be routine news from Citi. 'Any whiff of seemingly good news can give certain stocks a big boost, particularly since this isn't a normal market.' Citigroup led the banking sector higher, which lifted the broader market. Citi jumped 23.8 per cent to $US1.30, after hovering near the $US1 mark in recent days.  Elsewhere in the financial arena, Bank of America rallied 22.9 per cent to $US4.61, JPMorgan Chase added 16.3 per cent to $US18.50 and Wells Fargo advanced 9.4 per cent to $US10.91.  Delta Air Lines climbed 8.0 per cent to 4.52 after the leading US carrier said it was cutting international capacity by an additional 10 per cent.  In Europe, the London FTSE 100 index added 4.8 per cent to finish at 3715.23. The Paris CAC 40 soared 5.75 per cent to 2663.68, while in Frankfurt the Dax jumped 5.28 per cent to close at 3886.98.
