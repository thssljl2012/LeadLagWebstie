What's happened this morning:  1) Shorts attacked along the usual lines: wait until 10 AM ET, then press financials. One important point about today: the volume is not nearly as strong as the middle of the week, so shorts are showing signs of exhaustion.  2) Right after 10 ET, real estate investment trusts (REITs) were under pressure as Standard and Poors cut credit ratings on two REITs (Camden Property and First Industrial), and put 9 others on watch for possible cuts...concerns over tenant stress for retail properties, impact of the recession on apartment fundamentals, etc.  3) Techs were also weak this morning, with Google  loading...    [GOOG Loading...   ()  ] and IBM  loading...    [IBM Loading...   ()  ] both downside standouts  4) The final downside push came as GM  loading...    [GM Loading...   ()  ] began a late-morning slide to move below $1.60.  Despite the inability to rally, some are insisting we are groping for a bottom. They cite:  1) Payrolls: awful, but bottom around 600-650,000 the past four months  2) Commodities showing signs of a bottom  3) Housing starts well below household formations  4) Both the TALF and the stimulus plan will come on in the second quarter  5) Some insiders buying stock, including our parent company GE  loading...    [GE Loading...   ()  ], Wells Fargo  loading...    [WFC Loading...   ()  ], and Bank of America  loading...    [BAC Loading...   ()  ].  _____________________________  _____________________________  LATEST FROM TRADER TALK  Current DateTime: 10:06:31 06 Mar 2009  LinksList Documentid: 20477529  Expiration DateTime: 3/6/2009 10:09:09 AM
