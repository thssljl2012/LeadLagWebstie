Financials fall deeper, but their bounce off bottom could be higher than techs' comeback NEW YORK (Menafn - MarketWatch) -- U.S. bank stocks have a better shot at recovering from their recent collapse compared to how technology issues fared in their comeback in the wake of the dot.com bubble burst, some analysts said on Tuesday.  Last week's 84% decline in the Standard &amp; Poor's financial index from its February 2007 highs had the sector surpassing the 83% drop in the S&amp;P's Information Technology sector from its peak in March 2000 to its trough of Oct. 2002. 'There is probably more opportunity to get stabilization in financials in the near term, as in a year from now, they will have bounced off more from the bottom than have technology shares - so many of them went out of business,' said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies &amp; Co. Among the survivors, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO typifies the rebound in the technology sector, with what was an $80 stock in 2000 today trading below $15.  Looking at a broader gauge, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index COMP peaked at about 5,000 in 2000, and currently stands at around 1,300.  The current trouble plaguing U.S. banks will likely in the end means the FDIC will have closed a couple hundred out of 8,000-plus banks, 'as opposed to the two-thirds of the dot.coms that no longer exist,' said Hogan. 'We're not going to lose 6,000 banks. We may see some consolidation, but we'll have a collection of stronger consolidated banks with a de-risk business model and a de-leveraged balanced sheet and be stronger for it coming out,' said Hogan. 'There will be survivors, but the problem with the financial sector coming back is they (financial institutions) are going to be less regulated, probably in a way we've never seen before,' said Linda Duessel, equity strategist at Federated Securities.  On Tuesday, financial shares led a broad market rally after an intense sell-off, with investor sentiment bolstered in part by word from Citigroup Inc. C that it was profitable in the first two months of the year.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average $INDU gained 328.23 points to 6,875.28. The S&amp;P 500 Index $SPX rose 39.01 points to 715.54, and the Nasdaq gained 77.01 points to 1,345.65.
