'Our merger analysis indicates that J&amp;J could pay a 10  percent premium over Merck's original offer and the deal would be accretive for  J&amp;J in the first year whether or not Merck exercised its right to buy out its  cholesterol joint venture with Schering-Plough.'  Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson, a Dow component, rose 10 cents to $46.70 in  premarket trade while Schering-Plough shares added 7 cents to $20.30 before the  bell.
