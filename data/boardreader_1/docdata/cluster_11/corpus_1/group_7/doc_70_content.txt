NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- U.S. bank stocks added to earlier session gains as concerns grew that the government's planned medicine to heal the banks could sicken the patient further. The KBW Bank ETF  (KBE:  , , ) , which tracks major U.S. bank stocks, fell almost 9%. Analysts at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods said Thursday that by their estimate, 11 of the nation's biggest banks face the need to sell up to $116 billion of new common stock to meet capital requirements under a U.S. plan to stress test the industry. And, Goldman Sachs, in it own research report late Wednesday said that the planned government intervention is better for lenders than for borrowers. Goldman also said it expects bank losses to continue, and that in their estimate the sector has recorded only half the losses it must take. 'We forecast $2.1 trillion of losses from U.S. credit this cycle, or a roughly 9% cumulative loss rate,' Goldman said. 'About $1.1 trillion of losses have been announced to date, or about half of our total estimate, with about 80% of these losses showing up at US institutions and the remainder showing up primarily in Europe,' Goldman concluded.
