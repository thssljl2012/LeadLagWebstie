Led by declines in Bank of America(BAC Quote - Cramer on BAC - Stock Picks) and Citi(C Quote - Cramer on C - Stock Picks), the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 157 points, to 7194. The S&amp;P 500 was off by 17 points, to 756. The Nasdaq declined 26 points to 1416.  Those declines, arriving with worse-than-expected existing-home sales data and the start of the Treasury's 'stress test,' were despite the President's address to a joint-session of Congress on Tuesday night.  Investors who tuned in saw  President Obama  shift from the cautionary tone he had previously employed to a more confident position.  'Tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before,' said Obama.  The President touched on healthcare, education and energy, emphasized the significance of the credit crises, and defended the recent homeowner affordability and stability plan. Housing was to be top-of-mind for investors Wednesday morning.  The National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales in January declined to 4.49 million, the lowest level in nearly 12 years. Sales were down from 4.74 million in December, and undershot the expectation for 4.79 million.  The median sales price was lower by14.8%, year-over-year, at $170,300.  The Mortgage Bankers Association, providing its own portion of housing data, said the market composite index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased by 15.1% for the week of Feb. 20, on an adjusted basis. The average contract interest rate increased to 5.07% from 4.99% for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and to 4.71% from 4.66% for the 15-year variety.
