The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently off by 32 points at 7524, while the S&amp;P 500 edged down nearly a point to 790. The Nasdaq was lower by 7 points at 1461.  Banks again took a jab, with the KBW Banking index down 2.8% and Bank of America (BAC Quote - Cramer on BAC - Stock Picks) and Citigroup(C Quote - Cramer on C - Stock Picks) down around 9% apiece, leading the decliners on the Dow.  Hewlett Packard (HPQ Quote - Cramer on HPQ - Stock Picks) was also down steeply after earnings, with gains in Home Depot(HD Quote - Cramer on HD - Stock Picks) and CocaCola(KO Quote - Cramer on KO - Stock Picks) providing some balance.  Investors had plenty of data to sort through, including numbers on the job market. The Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims were unchanged for the week ended Feb. 14 at 627,000, a bit higher than expectations for 620,000.  The producer price index, an indication of inflation at the wholesale level, rose 0.8% in January after falling 1.9% the month prior and outpaced expectations for a 0.3% increase. Core prices, which factor out food and energy costs, rose 0.4%, also exceeding a 0.2% uptick the month prior and expectations for 0.1%.  'These figures, of course, are inconsistent with the recent behavior of commodity prices and the large amount of anecdotal evidence indicating that businesses are cutting prices,' writes Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller Tabak and RealMoney.com contributor. 'The disparity reflects the lag that exists between changes in commodity prices and finished goods prices.'
