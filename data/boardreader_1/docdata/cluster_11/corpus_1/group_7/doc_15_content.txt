Reduction in fuel prices and cheaper food items like tea and edible oils pulled down inflation to a year's low of 4.39 per cent. Inflation declined by 0.68 percentage points during the week ended January 31 from 5.07 per cent a week ago, mainly on account of reduction in prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas, announced by the government on January 28.  It was 4.74 per cent a year ago. Among food items that became cheaper during the week were tea, fruit and vegetables, and spices. Even the prices of imported edible oils, mustard oils and coconut oil came down. In the manufactured goods category, items of common use like dhoties, sarees, ceiling fans and cotton cloth became cheaper.   During the week, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) too became cheaper by as much as 15 per cent. However, items that turned expensive during the week were maize, wheat, rice and pulses and tobacco. The previous comparable low was recorded at 4.36 per cent for the week ended January 12, 2008. Inflation for the week ended December 6, 2008, has been revised downwards to 6.56 per cent as compared to 6.84 per cent in the provisional estimates.
