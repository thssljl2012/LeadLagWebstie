-- While stocks kicked off the year with their worst January performance ever, subscribers to the BullTrade.com 'Stock Alert' Service (Special Membership) have recently enjoyed several fantastic gains. Early in the month, a recommendation to short shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C - News) helped traders realize a 40% profit within a couple of days. In late December, members received a 'Trading Idea' that stated buying StemCells ahead of Obama's inauguration could pay off handsomely. As it turned out, the stock ran from $1.50 to nearly $3. Special Members are currently enjoying a six-year streak where over 96% of all closed-out trades have been winners. One member e-mailed his thanks in saying, 'I've only made three trades so far this year and I'm up 25%. Less is more! Keep up the great service!' The staff at BullTrade.com is focused on making 2009 one of the best trading years ever!  Other stocks that have been profiled or recommended in the past include Apple (NasdaqGS:AAPL - News), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC - News), DryShips (NasdaqGS:DRYS - News) and Potash.
