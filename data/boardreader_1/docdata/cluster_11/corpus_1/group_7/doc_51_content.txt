A bullish report in Barrons said that patience in the stock could be nicely rewarded and cited Pershing Squares faith in the company. - This stock hasn't been this cheap in a long time, explains Karen Finerman.

Veggies. It turns out, greens these days contain far fewer nutrients than they did 50 years ago.

Researchers think they could contain 5 to 40% less minerals than those harvested 50 years ago.  Wells Fargo (WFC) dropped 8%.

Uber-Rich Tax Evaders. This is a drop for the wealthy individuals who may have been avoiding paying their taxes through offshore accounts at UBS.

The SEC has been investigating the bank after a former executive said UBS had told American customers they didnt have to disclose their identities to the IRS.  Pool Corp (POOL) dropped 12%.
