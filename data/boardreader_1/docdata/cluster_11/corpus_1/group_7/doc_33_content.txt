Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) opened at $5.39. So far today, the stock has hit a low of $5.36 and a high of $5.76. BAC is now trading at $5.50, up $0.66 (13.64%). Over the last 52 weeks the stock has ranged from a low of $3.77 to a high of $43.81. BAC shares are surging this morning on news that company CEO Ken Lewis purchased almost $1 million worth of the company's common stock this week as a vote of confidence in the bank. He also said in a memo to employees that the company's board 'unanimously endorsed our business model, strategic direction and the team,' at its regular meeting last week. This could be a good sign for BAC. Technical indicators for the stock are neutral and S&amp;P gives BAC a neutral 3 STARS (out of 5) hold ranking. If you are looking for a hedged play on BAC the stock seems like it could be a candidate for a March out-of-the-money bull-put credit spread below the 4 range.
