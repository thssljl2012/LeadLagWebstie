Hong Kong's millionaires' club is losing numbers fast as its wealth slumps in the downturn.  In fact, it has lost 16 percent of its members. Worse still, members have lost 26 percent of their liquid assets.  Citibank interviewed 3,323 people, aged between 21 and 79, more than 400 of whom had over HK$1 million in liquid assets.  Projecting the results against an estimated population of 5.3 million, rather than the actual seven million recently announced, the bank said there are now 348,000 millionaires in the territory compared with 414,000 in 2007.  And their average assets shrank from HK$4.6 million to HK$3.4 million.  Those in the HK$5 million group are the hardest hit, with the numbers declining by 36 percent to 43,000.  The number of those with liquid assets between HK$2 million and HK$5 million dropped 10 percent to 86,000.  More than 60 percent of the millionaires interviewed said they lost money in stocks, averaging HK$427,000, while 30 percent lost an average of HK$158,000 in mutual funds and 18 percent on average lost HK$75,000 in foreign currencies.  'Even though their assets have shrunk, I believe the millionaires can still outlast the downturn as the market has strong foundations,' said Citibank deputy country business manager Simon Chow. Aggressive investments in equity products is the main reason so many lost money.  Millionaires are pessimistic about the economy this year, with 47 percent saying they will be more conservative in investing.  Just 11 percent said they will be more aggressive.  They also predicted the Hang Sang Index will linger between 10,000 and 15,500.  The number of 'pessimistic' or 'very pessimistic' millionaires on the property market soared from 10 percent in 2007 to 74 percent.  Those who are 'optimistic' or 'very optimistic' slumped from 48 percent to 6 percent.  Millionaires also claimed they have reduced their daily expenses.  Those who are employed are not confident about retaining their salary levels.
