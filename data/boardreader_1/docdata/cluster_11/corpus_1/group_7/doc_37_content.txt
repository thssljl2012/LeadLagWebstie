  Fannie Mae  FNM  Stocks in New York were uninspired after a tepid start Thursday as investors absorbed a mixed set of economic data and earnings.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently falling 13 points to 7542, while the S&amp;P 500 hung onto a one point gain at 790. The Nasdaq was off by 5 points at 1462.  Banks again took a jab, with the KBW Banking index down 1.8% and Bank of America (BAC Quote - Cramer on BAC - Stock Picks) and Citigroup(C Quote - Cramer on C - Stock Picks) tugging on the Dow.  Hewlett Packard (HPQ Quote - Cramer on HPQ - Stock Picks) was also down steeply after earnings, with gains in Alcoa(AA Quote - Cramer on AA - Stock Picks) and telecoms Verizon(VZN Quote - Cramer on VZN - Stock Picks) and AT&amp;T (ATT Quote - Cramer on ATT - Stock Picks) providing some balance.  Investors had plenty of data to sort through, including numbers on the job market. The Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims were unchanged for the week ended Feb. 14 at 627,000, a bit higher than expectations for 620,000.  The producer price index, which measures average change in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 0.8% in January after falling 1.9% the month prior and outpaced expectations for a 0.3% increase. Core prices, which factor out food and energy costs, rose 0.4%, also exceeding a 0.2% uptick the month prior and expectations for 0.1%.  'These figures, of course, are inconsistent with the recent behavior of commodity prices and the large amount of anecdotal evidence indicating that businesses are cutting prices,' writes Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller Tabak and RealMoney.com contributor. 'The disparity reflects the lag that exists between changes in commodity prices and finished goods prices.'
