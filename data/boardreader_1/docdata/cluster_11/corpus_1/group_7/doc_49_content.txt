Look at Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Aflac (NYSE: AFL), PNC Financial (NYSE: PNC), Zions Bancorp (NYSE: ZION), Harford Financial Services (NYSE: HIG), etc. (basically, any bank, insurer, and anyone else involved in the financial industry).  Take a look at the broad market indices. Notice how it's lingering sideways? The market can't rally without the financials. Keep an eye on this sector today.  I am still short the financials for a swing.
