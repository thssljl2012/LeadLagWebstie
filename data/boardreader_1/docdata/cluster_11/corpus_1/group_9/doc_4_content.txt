So, big reversals as the indices closed very near the session rally highs. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) advanced 2.96 to 233.87.

Stepping back and reviewing the hourly chart patterns, despite a very negative early start and big gap down, the indices rallied back sharply closing at the high end of the range for the day in a very impressive showing by the bulls. We?ll see if further overhead resistance at yesterday?s high at 1258 NDX and lateral price resistance at 815 SPX can thwart the rally or if the rally is able to extend past that and break out to the upside.
