Bolton captain Kevin Nolan returns from suspension for the visit of joint Barclays Premier League leaders Liverpool.  The boyhood Reds supporter served a one-match ban during last weekends 1-0 victory at Hull but he should make an immediate return to the starting line-up.  Wanderers boss Gary Megson has no other concerns and could discard the 4-4-2 formation he used at the KC Stadium, reverting to a 4-5-1 and bringing back Nolan at Johan Elmanders expense.  Provisional squad: Jaaskelainen, Steinsson, Cahill, A OBrien, Samuel, Nolan, Riga, McCann, J OBrien, Muamba, Gardner, Taylor, Davies, Elmander, Al Habsi, Shittu, Smolarek, Helguson, Basham, Cohen, Fojut.
