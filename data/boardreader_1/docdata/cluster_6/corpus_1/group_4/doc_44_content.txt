 Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher has been withdrawn from Scotland's squad to face Argentina next week after sustaining a knee injury.  Fletcher played 63 minutes of United's 5-0 victory over Stoke in the Barclays Premier League at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon before he was replaced by Darron Gibson.  Wednesday's match against the South Americans at Hampden Park will be Diego Maradona's first as manager of the national team.
