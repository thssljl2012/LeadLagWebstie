Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate will choose between record signing Afonso Alves and top scorer Mido for Sundays Barclays Premier League match at Aston Villa.  With Tuncay Sanli almost certain to retain his place in attack after an impressive return from injury, Southgate must decide on a partner for the Turkey international.  Mido came off the bench to net his fifth goal of the campaign against West Ham last weekend to stake his claim. Southgate is expected to name Justin Hoyte at right-back against Villa, relegating David Wheater to the bench, while Julio Arca is poised to replace Didier Digard in central midfield.  Provisional squad: Turnbull, Hoyte, Taylor, Riggott, Pogatetz, ONeil, Arca, Aliadiere, Downing, Tuncay, Mido, Jones, Wheater, Digard, Emnes, Walker, A Johnson, Alves.
