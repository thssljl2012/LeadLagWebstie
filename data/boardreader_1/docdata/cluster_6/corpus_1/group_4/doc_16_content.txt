Chelsea are odds-on for the Barclays Premier League title following Liverpool's 2-1 loss at Spurs on Saturday evening.  Phil Scolari's side beat Sunderland 5-0 earlier, but only went 10/11 with the layers once Liverpool somehow managed to contrive defeat at White Hart Lane.  Rafa Benitez's side went 1-0 up inside three minutes through Dirk Kuyt and controlled the majority of the game for the next 70 minutes, hitting the bar three times but couldn't find the killer second goal.  A late Jamie Carragher own goal was followed by an injury-time winner from Roman Pavlyuchenko to leave Benitez's side second in the table on goal difference.  Liverpool are now 9/2 for the title, with Manchester United 15/8 second favourites following their narrow 4-3 win over Hull City.  Cristiano Ronaldo bagged a brace and is now 7/2 favourite to win the Golden Boot from 9/2 chance Fernando Torres who didn't play any part at Tottenham.  Arsenal are out to 20/1 for the league title after they lost 2-1 at Stoke City.  The relegation market has drastically seen a shake-up following Saturday's events and Spurs are now 14/1 to go down with Boylesports, who offered 11/4 exactly a week ago.  Tottenham are now the same price as Portsmouth to go down, as Harry Redknapp's former club lost 2-1 at home to Wigan.  Stoke are still favourites for the drop, but are now 8/15 following their win over the Gunners.  Latest Zone Stories
