Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate is hoping he is the man to finally keep striker Mido happy.The 25-year-old has proved something of a footballing nomad throughout his career to date, having played in his native Egypt, Belgium, Holland, Spain, France and Italy before arriving in England.Indeed, Boro are his eighth club after spells with Zamalek, Gent, Ajax, Celta Vigo, Marseille, Roma and Tottenham, and he was linked with a loan move to Wigan during the final days of the summer transfer window.Southgate admits he can see why Mido might have fallen out with a succession of managers, but believes his desperation to play is the reason for his itchy feet.He told the club's official website, www.mfc.co.uk: 'I can see why he might not have settled in the past - he is an emotional lad who wants to play football.'The fact is certain managers might not have known how to deal with him and may have fallen out with him as a result of that.'I hardly ever have fall-outs and it is very rare that I don't get along with people.'I enjoy working with Mido. He has good opinions on the game and is an intelligent lad who wants to win and wants the team to do well.'Asked about Wigan's interest, which was revealed by Mido during a trip back to Egypt in August, Southgate said: 'I don't think he wanted to go anywhere.'I think he just wanted to let me know how much he wanted to play.'Southgate will hope to have Mido available for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with West Brom after he pulled out of last weekend's Wear-Tees derby clash against Sunderland after the warm-up with a groin problem.
