Harry gets cracking Harry Redknapp insisted that he wanted to 'get cracking straight away' as we marked his first day in charge with our first league victory of the campaign against Bolton on Sunday.   Development coach Clive Allen selected the team to take on Bolton but Harry drove straight to the team hotel first thing Sunday morning to meet the players and was heavily involved throughout the day, taking his place alongside Clive on the touchline. His arrival certainly lifted the club and the players responded in fine style as goals from Roman Pavlyuchenko after 17 minutes and Darren Bent's penalty after 75 minutes secured a much-needed 2-0 win in the Barclays Premier League. Harry reflected: &amp;quot;I met the players at the hotel, had a chat with them at about half past 11, came in with them on the coach, went into the dressing room and got cracking straight away. &amp;quot;I only joined the club on Saturday night, so Clive put the team together, it was fine and I said 'great, let's go with that'. &amp;quot;I could have sat in the stand and watched the game but there was no point in that, we haven't got time. I needed to get cracking so I got into it straight away. &amp;quot;My first priority here is to stay in the Premier League. The record was two points from eight games and we're in trouble, no question. The priority is points and getting up that league table and it was a great start for us.&amp;quot;  Tottenhamhotspur.com - News Articles - Harry gets cracking
