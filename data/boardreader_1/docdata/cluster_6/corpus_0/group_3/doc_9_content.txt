Tuesday 14 October, 2008. Everton. Barclays Premier Reserve League North Home 19:30.   from the offal...  After playing at The Racecourse Ground, Wrexham for the last three seasons a decision was made to bring the Club's home fixtures in the Barclays Premier Reserve League North closer to the city of Liverpool. After looking at a number of possible alternatives it was agreed that the home of Super League Club Warrington Wolves would make an ideal venue for Gary Ablett's side to play their games.  The Halliwell Jones Stadium was opened in October 2003 and boasts a capacity of 14,000 with the North and East Stands being fully seated, whilst the South and West Stands offer covered terracing.  Admission will be by payment of cash at the turnstiles on the night of each game:   ADULTS - 5.00 CONCESSIONS (UNDER 16S AND OVER 65S) - 2.00 Alternatively supporters can purchase tickets in advance of each game direct from Warrington Wolves.  Supporters should be aware that reserve team fixtures are always subject to change - sometimes at very short notice and you are advised to check for up to date information on match dates and kick off times.       could be a good game... a chance to see some decent football and possible rising stars that will hopefully be breaking into the first team... a good way to see yer team play for the price of a couple of pints...:)
