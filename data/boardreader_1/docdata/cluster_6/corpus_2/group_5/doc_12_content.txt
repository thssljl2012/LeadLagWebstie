I agree with some of what u say, but hayes is the biggest offensive liablity in the league. At least deke will dnk the ball, rebound and blk shots. I agree about the cba guy which is puzzling to me. I watched Jelani Mccoy in the preseason and I thought he would be a good 16 min backup, but the gm has said he doesn't care about size before so why would he start now?
