We should be more worried about Man City owners Stake in Barclays.    This looks like a serious conflict of interests ,and the FA(predictably) are stunningly mute on the matter.    Owning a third of Barclays ,Prem Sponsors, and a Prem club has to be bad for football.The FA should be asking the owners to offload their interest in Mancity ASAP
