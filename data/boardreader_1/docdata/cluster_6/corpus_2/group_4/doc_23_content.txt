   quote   Andy_Jay1987     Silvestre is a shite centre back, not that bad as a full back though, but Wenger has bought him to play in the middle, why does wenger always change people, he&amp;#039;s only ever had one roaring success, Henry.   I dunno, we didn&amp;#039;t need cover in the fullback positions. I&amp;#039;d rather have kept Traore and not bought that useless prick.    quote   Stealth107       quote   Subaru7      You know, thinking on Wenger, he could become the most dangerous manager ever.  Just look at the average age of Arsenal.  In about 3 years, they could become the invincibles again. He&amp;#039;s signed potential legends and now, only time can tell if Arsenal will become invincible again.    What happends if they get fed up of not winning any major titles in three years and leave?    This message was edited by Stealth107 on Nov 01 2008.     Exactly the point. Year after year we&amp;#039;re told this. When do boys become men? You can keep saying he&amp;#039;s building for the future. But when will this &amp;#039;future&amp;#039; become the present. We have an exceptionally talented team. But with this comes desire, and unless we get the mix right with talented experienced players, we&amp;#039;ll lose our talented youngsters because they want to go somewhere to win something.  Nyff, I think it&amp;#039;s wrong to say they gave up, it had nothing to do with that. They tried to continue scoring, when it was the wrong thing to do.  And I&amp;#039;d rather Wenger spent money on someone to replace Viera (and nobody *bleep*ing say Diaby), and get us in a solid CB as well.
