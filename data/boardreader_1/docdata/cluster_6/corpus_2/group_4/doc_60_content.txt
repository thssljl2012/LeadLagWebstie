      Nasri and Fabregas both have the same age (21), and Walcott is two years younger. They are all three the future of Arsenal.    Quote -  Sir Alex Fergusson   &amp;amp;quot;The chances we had in the game were incredible. It was the area in which we let ourselves down. I think if we&amp;#039;d got one when Cristiano Ronaldo got his great chance, then we&amp;#039;d have got something out of the game.  &amp;amp;quot;It was fantasy football, it was like playground stuff - you attack, we attack - and they got the goals that mattered.  &amp;amp;quot;In fairness to my own team, after the second goal their determination and drive to try and rescue the game was fantastic and we probably deserved something from the game.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t think you&amp;#039;ll see a game as good as that anywhere else in the country.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;amp;quot;Sometimes you just have to hold your hands up and say &amp;#039;if you&amp;#039;re going to get beaten, just make sure it&amp;#039;s someone who&amp;#039;s going to play football&amp;#039; and Arsenal played good football at times.&amp;amp;quot;     Source:  Football.co.uk
