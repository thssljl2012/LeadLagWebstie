 I&amp;#039;d usually go for Villa, but Ive got them in my acca, so Ive got a sneaky suspision Newcastle may just pip them! I&amp;#039;d like to see Newcastle do well, not at the expense of my betting though!   Also I need Youngs fantast points.  Jonaldinho I agree Villa look tired. Have use got another Uefa match this week too?   Im going to sit on the fence &amp;amp; go for a 2-2 draw!
