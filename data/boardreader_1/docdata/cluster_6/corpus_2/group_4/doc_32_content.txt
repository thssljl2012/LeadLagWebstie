 I do agree with you and others that have said this. I love Cole and want him to pitch the rest of his career here, happily. However, I also see if from the owners point of view too, and in that case, Cole will not be making what the elite players in the league who have the service time in the league will be making next year.  Honestly, if I put myself in the owners shoes, I&amp;#039;d let it play out exactly how it&amp;#039;s going too. He&amp;#039;s going to get his money. He is going to be rich next next. He just won&amp;#039;t be filthy stinking rich for a few more years.  Cole was fried last year when he didn&amp;#039;t get the raise he wanted. Once his agent and others talked to him and he understand how it works better, I think he understood and was ok with it. He might not have liked it, but he understood it. If anything, guys like Cole and other younger players in the league should take more of an initiave and gets things straight when the next CBA is negotiated in 2011. Maybe when pigs fly, the Adam Eaton&amp;#039;s won&amp;#039;t be paid 8 million by the Phills next year and Cole&amp;#039;s will be filthy rich.        Edited 11/6/2008 7:36 pm ET by jskro
