   quote   Irish Gamer     I really don&amp;#039;t think we need any more investment in the squad until next summer. Anelka&amp;#039;s goals haven&amp;#039;t been spectacular but he&amp;#039;s joint top scorer with Zaki. He&amp;#039;s been working hard for the team (something everyone always said Anelka would never do), against Liverpool he was our 2nd best player behind Mikel, won most headers that went up to him and had zero support from Malouda and Kalou. Imo he doesn&amp;#039;t deserve to be dropped.   Hum, i think we do tbh. Malouda&amp;#039;s brilliant when we&amp;#039;re playing not so good teams that give him space n all but when we&amp;#039;re playing teams like Liverpool &amp;amp; Roma he seems to go missing because they&amp;#039;re pressuring him. Still think we need that flair player to go with Cole, somebody like Robinho or Aguero who can handle being closed down quickly against top teams and can light up a game with abit of magic. I know theres no chance of Robinho coming, was just using him as an example. Aguero is somebody who is very young and when i have seen him play, he looks asif he could handle the premierships physical demands.   Also, i don&amp;#039;t know if it will be this summer or the one after, but our squads getting old and we&amp;#039;re in need of a big influx of good young players. We&amp;#039;ve got Di Sant who will properly make the first team and maybe Stoch, Woods, Mancienne, Kakuta, Sinclair and Paim if he signs.
