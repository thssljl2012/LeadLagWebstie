Especially with Arsenal&amp;#039;s injuries &amp;amp; unfit players list growing after every match.   ur right about being man u being stronger in a few departments but the injurys is wrong coz theo , gallas and sagna are all back for man u.       They just said on SSN that Walcott&amp;#039;s fitness is unknown and it could be days OR weeks.  Who knows,   or cares.  I don&amp;#039;t wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper! I fffffart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
