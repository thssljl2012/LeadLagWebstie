Rafael was insane. The composure and leadership for an 18 year old infront of 60000 people was incredible. I thought from the moment he came on he always looked like United&amp;#039;s most dangerous weapon. United were pretty flat in the end, then they show footage of Rafael clapping encouraging them on, was great to see. I&amp;#039;m not kidding, before the ball even got to him, I actually said out load, &amp;amp;quot;he&amp;#039;s gonna score.&amp;amp;quot; Can&amp;#039;t wait to see him develop over the years
