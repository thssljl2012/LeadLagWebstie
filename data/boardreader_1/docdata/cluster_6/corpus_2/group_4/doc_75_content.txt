It&amp;#039;s probably not as bad as many Arsenal fans are making out.                      speaking from Villa&amp;#039;s perspective, that loss against Boro just becomes all the more annoying now. completely unacceptable.      even a point would&amp;#039;ve been crap. (boro aren&amp;#039;t a bad side)      I can take getting nothing from the Newcastle game. away from home, some decent chances missed, beaten by some reasonable football.      that can happen to teams like Villa. and it will happen to teams like Villa.      Aston Villa aren&amp;#039;t Chelsea or Manchester United, they can&amp;#039;t expect to go play all the midtable clubs away from home and win easily.
