 How is it obstruction if he&amp;#039;s standing with his back to Reina? Fact is any Liverpool defender pushes a Bolton player in the back like that and it&amp;#039;s a penalty, but because it&amp;#039;s a keeper the ref ignores it.  Reina blatantly pushes him which is against the rules while standing there is not.
