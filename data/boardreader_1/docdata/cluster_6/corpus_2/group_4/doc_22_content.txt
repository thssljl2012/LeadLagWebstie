   quote   toby21       quote   Jmste     The past few games he hasn&amp;#039;t been to good, he needs to improve or else he will get dropped, but I think that we should after the hard games, he has been taking pain killers before every game when Hutton collided with him in training, he must be injured. Surely Cesar isn&amp;#039;t that bad? He should get a run out while Gomes recovers.   Is this the Cesar that used to play for R.Madrid back in the day but never got a look in? Wow, if Casillas wasn&amp;#039;t there then they wouldn&amp;#039;t have had to search for a new keeper, the guy is outstanding. A bit like the Cudicini situation but he&amp;#039;s better than him. (I hope I&amp;#039;ve got the right Cesar  ). Don&amp;#039;t know why so much faith has been shown in Gomes, he&amp;#039;s poor and each game just appears to be demoralising him.   Yeah Cesar was quality, but surely it&amp;#039;s a different guy, the Real Madrid one must be retired by now?
