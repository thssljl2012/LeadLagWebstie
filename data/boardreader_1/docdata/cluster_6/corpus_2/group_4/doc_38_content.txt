 The thing with Arsenal is that when they play well, they are brilliant. Absolutely unstoppable, and for me - no-one in the Premiership can match their style of play. However - the difference between them and Chelsea, United and more recently Liverpool - is that when they play bad, their performance is at the other end of the extreme and they struggle to pick up wins. Take for example when United played Bolton and Blackburn over the last few months, didn&amp;#039;t play too well but still managed to pick up 6 out of 6 points. Same with Chelsea, average against Wigan and Stoke, yet still managed 2 wins. Arsenal however, have to bank on a 93rd minute equaliser to get a point against Sunderland, dominated by Stoke, and lose to Fulham/Hull etc... Come on, with the ability of the squad Wenger has, they really should be picking up wins against these type of teams. Something which may have already cost them the title.
