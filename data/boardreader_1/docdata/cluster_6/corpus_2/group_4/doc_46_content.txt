   I don&amp;#039;t feel Malouda&amp;#039;s been that great. He did nothing against Roma, and has been kinda quiet in last few games. Took him loads of shots before scoring against Hull. I like him as a player though so I hope he gets better. I reckon we could have Drogba and Anelka upfront with Kalou/Joe Cole behind them. Might as well give it a go.
