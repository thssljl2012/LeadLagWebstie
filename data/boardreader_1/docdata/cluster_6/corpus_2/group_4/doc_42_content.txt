   quote   DjedwardSmith     Biased, of course, but does anyone think that the best games in the league are ALWAYS Arsenal United. Only really challenged by Arsenal Chelsea or Pool Chelsea.   I think it is, but, they were better games when the likes of roy keane, hughes for united and viera, bergkamp and keown for arsenal were around and when they were played at highbury, i don&amp;#039;t know why though maybe its just a personal preference
