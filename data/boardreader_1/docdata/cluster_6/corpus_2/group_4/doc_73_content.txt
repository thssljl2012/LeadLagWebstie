 I dunno. I see your point. But then you have to look at the cost to Arsenal for developing these players. Wages, coaching and the like. It&amp;#039;s an investment that goes beyond merely paying a few thousand for a youngster. Who&amp;#039;s to say that they&amp;#039;d develop that well if they hadn&amp;#039;t have moved away.  I think that that 16 year old Italian guy who they pinched from Roma would be a better example. Where they offered his Dad a groundsman job... That was poaching
