Good finishes from him though.     I can&amp;#039;t believe how incredibly naive West Bromwich Albion are. They think they can rock up anywhere, try and pass it around like they&amp;#039;re Arsenal, and leave gaps all over the pitch.     It&amp;#039;s quite remarkable. As well as arrogant and stupid.     They&amp;#039;ll go down easily playing with this level of arrogance.
