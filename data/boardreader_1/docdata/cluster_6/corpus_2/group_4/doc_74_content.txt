   quote   Irish Gamer     Don&amp;#039;t listen to Mycon, he&amp;#039;s from the backarse of nowhere so when he says &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;ve never met one&amp;quot; it&amp;#039;s not really surprising seeing as his town probs has about 10 people.  Hi Mycon       backarse of nowhere, I love that expression, I used to use it to describe where I lived, for ur info castleplunkett in roscommon *shudders*  I know for a fact there are plenty of yids in Ireland though   but Liverpool and Man United really dominate.
