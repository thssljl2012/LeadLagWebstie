  Fantastic game today, not the best game to of gone to but hey! I wouldn&amp;#039;t say Arsenal deserved 3 points, but then again neither did we! Should of took our chances, United fans were pretty poor today really! I still think Arsenal - United is the best fixure in the prem! So erm, well played Arsenal I suppose    I reckon it could be a close one for the title this year.
