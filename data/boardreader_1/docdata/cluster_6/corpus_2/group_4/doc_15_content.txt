 Also your goal was rightly dissallowed. Nolan stopped Reina from coming from the ball. If you watch it again you&amp;#039;ll agree Im sure.   I dont think he should be allowed to officiate Bolton matches tho. It is bound to effect his performance when 20 odd thousend people are calling him a cheat throughout the match.
