  I was expecting Bolton to win. Honestly, take it from a team that has a 10-1 aggregate score against Manchester City at the Riverside this calendar year.  Man City need to work on that away form if they wish to finish higher then 7th.  EDIT: 8th in the Premiership. Good stuff. Wasn&amp;#039;t expecting that. The bad thing is that we are leading the pack from 8th to 18th.
