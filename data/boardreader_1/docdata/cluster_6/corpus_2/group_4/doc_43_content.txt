 Having seen the highlights last night, I&amp;#039;m even more annoyed. Wenger said that we prepared for his throw ins. If that&amp;#039;s the case, why the *bleep* was there nobody on the *bleep*ing posts. Time after time Clichy or Fabby have been on the line from a corner and saved us, but for Delap&amp;#039;s throws, we didn&amp;#039;t.   Silvestre should never play again, and Gallas should be a back up. Toure and Song to start, and ffs, as much as I hated him, even Calamity was betteri n that he was a typical CB. I&amp;#039;d rather lose possession by him hoofing it out rather than not being able to get the ball in the air altogether.  Oh yeah, and Shawcross&amp;#039; tackle was *bleep*ing out of order. As was Delap&amp;#039;s on Walcotts. Cyncial *bleep*ing twats.  Oh, and Walcott&amp;#039;s injury is &amp;#039;&amp;#039;very serious&amp;#039;&amp;#039;. Just what I *bleep*ing wanted to hear.
