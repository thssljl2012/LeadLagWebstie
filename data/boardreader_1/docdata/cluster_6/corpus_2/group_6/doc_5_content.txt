 I usually just leave the default United formation when there is no CAM on. Baf is our only real CAM atm and therefore when he isn't on I cba to change.    I don't mind tbh... tonight though, if I play, I'm hoping to get more matches in upfront/rm. I'll do any for the team and all, but I love playing further forward.
