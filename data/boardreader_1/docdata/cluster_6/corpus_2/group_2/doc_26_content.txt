          The fickle nature of football eh? After the Utd game and the arrogant dismissals of Stoke, a lot of people think the league is over after the next 5 games.   11 points would be a great run from those games, and am not a Rafatollah but I do agree with his assertion that with the dominant play we had on Saturday, most times you would win the game. It&amp;amp;#039;s true that we always fail to beat teams who end up relegated (Palace, Reading, Birmingham, Charlton) - so enjoy it while it lasts, Stoke.
