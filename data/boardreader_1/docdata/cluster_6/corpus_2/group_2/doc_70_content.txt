Bloody TV and pansy assed women playing football has ruined the Premier League.  Fitness this and Rest that, bollocks, if I was told to play football ONCE A WEEK on a saturday and maybe if I&amp;#039;m lucky an extra game in the middle I&amp;#039;d be extactic, and I wouldnt ask for 50,000+ a week to do it.   Nicholson, Stein, Clough, Shankly, Busby and Paisley must be turning in their graves.  I always said I was a reincarnated bitter 60-year-old.
