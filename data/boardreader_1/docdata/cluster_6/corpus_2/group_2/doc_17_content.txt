Saturday, 27 September 2008   Everton v Liverpool, 12:45 - Should win   Sunday, 05 October 2008   Man City v Liverpool, 15:00 - Toughie, but they&amp;amp;#039;re weak at the back so we should nab it.   Saturday, 18 October 2008   Liverpool v Wigan, 15:00 - SHOULD win, but again, like the Stoke game, the sort of game we usually don&amp;amp;#039;t win...   Sunday, 26 October 2008   Chelsea v Liverpool, 13:30 - It&amp;amp;#039;s got 0-0 written all over it   Wednesday, 29 October 2008   Liverpool v Portsmouth, 20:00 - Should get it done. &amp;amp;nbsp;
