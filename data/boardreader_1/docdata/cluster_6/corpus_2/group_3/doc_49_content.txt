   quote   Venne     I wouldn&amp;#039;t think less of him for going to United, what i meant was that if he goes to United and they play Chelsea, will he be able to keep his mouth shut if something goes against him. If he doesn&amp;#039;t he&amp;#039;ll loose a hell alot of respect from the Chelsea fans.  Now we&amp;#039;ve had Scolari, who plays attacking football, i don&amp;#039;t really want a manager like Mourinho, I think all the Chelsea fans are loving the attacking football with 5-0 wins too much to go back to boring football with 1-0s.   First thing you say was basically my point as well    And I agree on the 2nd point, even though people still go on about the money and Abramovich and blah blah blah, the feel of the club is a lot better. Reminds me of the Gullit/Vialli times.
