 I meant to have written lost points.  But yes, I see this as a loss.   TBH, if I was Gallas, I&amp;#039;d have *bleep*ing made sure I was running back towards goal the second Modric shot. Unlike Sivlestre, who&amp;#039;s clearly still on the United payroll, who just stood still watching it go over his head.    This message was edited by DjedwardSmith on Oct 29 2008.    Sunderland. Hull. Spurs.   How many more awesome goals are gonna get scored against us that cause us to drop points.    This message was edited by DjedwardSmith on Oct 29 2008.
