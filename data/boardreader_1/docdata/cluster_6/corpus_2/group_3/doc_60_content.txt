   quote   Nel4Life     Did I say that&amp;#039;s the only reason? No, I&amp;#039;m saying he is to thank because he&amp;#039;s clearly made it so the players want to go out and play to impress him. Of course there are other factors, but it&amp;#039;s quite obviously not a coincidence that a new manager comes in, and all of a sudden we&amp;#039;re playing a different style of football, closing down and wanting to win, is it?   No, Levy made it by bringing him in.   I didn&amp;#039;t watch the game so can&amp;#039;t comment on what style of football you played, but from the soudns of it, you benefited more from Bolton making mistakes than from you playing a new style of football.  Again, after what must have been no more than an hour with the players, there&amp;#039;s nothing more he could have done than given them a kick up the arse verbally, which anybody can do.   Wait and see if in a few matches time they&amp;#039;re still playing that way, and then you can give him some credit for it.
