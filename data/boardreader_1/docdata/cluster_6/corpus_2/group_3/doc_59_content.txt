   Carlos rubbishes claims         Carlos Tevez has moved to distance himself from quotes attributed to him in various media sources on Thursday.       Reports suggested the Argentina international was feeling the strain of playing in the Barclays Premier League and was unhappy with his recent form.      But Tevez insists he has no idea where these quotes originated, and denies any association with them.      A spokesperson for the striker said the quotes were totally untrue.       Carlos has just told me that he loves playing in the English league and is very happy at Manchester United, the spokesperson said.       He is conscious only of helping the team to win and is not worried about where he plays on the pitch. Nor does he feel the Barclays Premier League has extra pressure.      Carloss prime objective is to help the team and his team-mates to continue winning.&amp;amp;quot;       http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pa...newsid=6620635
