 Ok, so ive roughly figured out your discussions is the best derbies.. right? (clap for me if you wish) TBH im sure everyone think there derby is the best, i could just point out the fact that despite conceding a goal early on we sang for the whole 90 minutes against villa, but then again i expect that from derbies. and the fact that some people class the best derbies as liverpool man utd.... it isnt even a proper derby.. isnt the meaning behind a derby that it&amp;#039;s local... correct if im wrong
