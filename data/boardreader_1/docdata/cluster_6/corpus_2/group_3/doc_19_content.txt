   quote   DjedwardSmith       quote   _Chernaboug     I will say Dj that I really don&amp;#039;t need any more &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot; to dislike him any more. Nearly everything I see and read about him just rubs me the wrong way, just like Cantona used to.  I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;ve ever honestly attacked Fabregas for no reason or out of nowhere, to be fair. It&amp;#039;s just me expressing my displeasure at something he&amp;#039;s done at the time. The fact that it&amp;#039;s happened enough for me to have a reputation for not liking him would suggest that he&amp;#039;s a colourful character at the very least.   Meh, I know what you mean. I have the same sort of feeling about RVN, amongst other players.     quote   Andy_Jay1987     No it wasnt. Only an idiot would enjoy it. Like soccer AM, utter shit since Tim, Sheephead, Fenners and Tramp left.      So why didn&amp;#039;t you enjoy it?  And JM, don&amp;#039;t be an idiot, it was a *bleep*ing comment in a magazine with little to no substance whatsoever. And with the way you&amp;#039;ve been playing, it&amp;#039;s not that outlandish to think. Spurs are the only ones being compared because the question was most probably ABOUT THEM.   Seriously, mountain out of a *bleep*ing molehill people.   Y&amp;#039;see Djed. It&amp;#039;s a foolish comment to make. Your just heading into a derby against yyour main rivals, and you say they wouldn&amp;#039;t be able to beat the equivalent ladies. From the sources i&amp;#039;ve read and heard about this from, it doesnt sound like he was having a bit of banter either. Fact is, it&amp;#039;s disrespectful and obnoxious of Fabregas to say it. If it were a Tottenham player saying it, i&amp;#039;m sure you&amp;#039;d feel the same. No need to call me an idiot btw, i&amp;#039;m sure you&amp;#039;d be one of the first to critiscize the Spurs player at question, if the shoe was on the other foot. That&amp;#039;s a compliment btw, not a dig.      This message was edited by Junior Messi on Oct 29 2008.
