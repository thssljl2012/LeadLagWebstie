   quote   Sam       quote  Arsenal09    Here we go with the cheap &amp;quot;what have arsenal won digs&amp;quot;  Really means nothing coming from the guy who only supports a team because they&amp;#039;re winning trophys.Typical.   Maybe it was because you had a cheap dig at United in your post that he said that?  Anyway stray away from arguing and that please guys, also Arsenal09 I don&amp;#039;t see why you don&amp;#039;t just admit it, everyone else has admitted Spurs deserved it.   Probably coz hes a true gooner
