   quote   g_lfc     I dont want them to go down. Id prefer to see the teams who have half empty grounds most weeks go down. i.e Middlesbrough, Wigan, Bolton etc. (sorry D I O S)   25,000 fans last week, thank you very much and amazing noise! Doesn&amp;#039;t really help when half the kids in Bolton support United and Pool, either does it. I actually know someone who debunked 4 generations of Wanderers supporters to support the scum, disgraceful stuff! His dad refuses to acknowledge him when he wears a United top!  And, oh goody! Spurs are shite with no luck or ability for 8 games, meaning they&amp;#039;ll most likely play amazing against us!   Believe me stick money on us losing, most likely from a winning position.
