  We should play counter-attacking football if we wish to get a point outta of this. Chelsea&amp;#039;s back-line will be weaker but it&amp;#039;s still strong. I would go with:          Turnbull                   Hoyte Wheater Riggott Taylor*           Aliadiere Digard Shawky Johnson Downing                           Mido       = Doubtful      Mido usually does well in big games so he has the upper advantage and I don&amp;#039;t think Alves will be fed much goalscoring opportunities with a great air and physical defender like Alex and a tall young Ivanovic.  Alves and Tuncay should both come in the 2nd half, with maybe Grounds depending on the performance and the fatigue of the defence.
