   quote   g_lfc     If other players didnt commit fouls then they wouldnt get sent off. Its part of football.  Stop whinging anyway, its not like Arsenal, Chelsea &amp;amp; Utd have never done it.   I think people are more displeased at Liverpool coming back and &amp;#039;scraping&amp;#039; if you will another win. Boro, Citeh and now Wigan have all been last gasp wins. And Alonso once again being the culprit of a sending off. May just be a coincidence, but you have to be a bit suspect that three sending offs in three games are all a result of Alonso being tackled. Would like to know if the first Valencia booking is one, as it seemed like that changed the game.  Still cannot wait to see Zaki&amp;#039;s goals.
