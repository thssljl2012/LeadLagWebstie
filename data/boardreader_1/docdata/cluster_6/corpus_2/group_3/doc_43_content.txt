 Premier League official site :   Quote:   Liverpool will be missing three key players for Saturday&amp;#039;s home Barclays Premier League match against Wigan Athletic. Out for 10 to 15 days with a hamstring injury is striker   Fernando Torres  , who will also miss the Champions League midweek trip back to Atletico Madrid and the vital league fixture at Chelsea on Sunday week. Also missing will be winger   Ryan Babel  , who picked an ankle injury on international duty - and boss Rafael Benitez must decide on a replacement for defender   Martin Skrtel  , out until Christmas with a knee injury sustained against Manchester City.    Daniel Agger   or   Sami Hyypia   will come into defence, while   Dirk Kuyt   will probably partner   Robbie Keane   up front.   Yossi Benayoun   could also come in.
