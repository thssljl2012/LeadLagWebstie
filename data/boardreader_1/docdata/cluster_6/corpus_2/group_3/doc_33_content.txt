  Quite confident against Blackburn considering their recent form and their injury list. No Reid or Dunn kills their spark and strenght in the center and with both Cruz and Samba doubtful we shouldn&amp;#039;t worry much.  I would play:               Turnbull                   Wheater Riggott Pogatetz Taylor                   Aliadiere Digard Johnson Downing                            Alves Mido   Bench: Jones, Grounds, Emnes, Tuncay Sanli, O&amp;#039;Neil, Shawky, *reserve*.  Finally a decent looking squad since a long time! Tuncay should come in the 2nd half to give us some skill upfront and maybe Shawky and Grounds will come on depending on the score and performance.
