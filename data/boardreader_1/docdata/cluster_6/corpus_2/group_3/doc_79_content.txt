 Mourinho would be a nice choice...I would think hes better with tactics than Sir Alex (certainly in Europe) and his motivational skills are right up there. Still unsure on whether he can pick out gems and good bargains like Sir Alex can though.  He&amp;#039;ll get us to win...the odd rout but usually a 1-0 or 2-0 win like with Chelsea.
