     quote  Junior Messi    I saw that alot over the net from Arsenal fans  4 points from two games, Harry&amp;#039;s got the team motivated and playing. Hopefully a point would be lovely against the Pool. Not expecting a win by any means, but if we fight like we did against Arse, a shock could be on the cards. But i doubt. Looking forward to an 8 day roster aswell. Not long since we&amp;#039;ve had such a weekend in recent times.  Ahh But Thats Arsenal  Yeah I Know Harry Did A Good Job Turning them around for the Arsenal game But Now They Are Facing The League Leaders   We will be a much tougher task
