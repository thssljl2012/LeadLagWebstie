 *bleep*s sake! No *bleep*ing pace, letting them just run at us and pass the ball, no Gardner + no Riga=no pace we&amp;#039;re playing 2 DMs and midfielder who has to be back agaisnt the worst defence in the *bleep*ing league. What the *bleep* does Megson expect us to do? Play a long ball to Elamnder who&amp;#039;ll score? *bleep*s sake!
