 Well that was a frustrating game. We should have won by a whole lot more in all honesty, but we did manage to get the win and it&amp;#039;s good that we got the penalty when we did.  Looking forward to having Torres back though as it means that we should be able to put away more of the chances we get, I think if Torres had been playing today we would have been more clinical in front of goal, that&amp;#039;s what we have been lacking lately without him. Looking forward to his return.   Arsenal/Spurs result was crazy, my brother (Arsenal Fan) was  not  happy when he got in from work, don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;m gonna bother talking to him &amp;#039;til tomorrow.
