   quote   ManUtd Fan123     Giggs played CM against  Aalborg  and ran the show, and Fletcher is a solid player, but unfortunately we have no other alternatives atm    West Brom are a different proposition to Aalborg. I know Fletcher is solid, I&amp;#039;m just not too keen on that partnership. I suppose you&amp;#039;re right though, we don&amp;#039;t have many options at the minute.  I hope I&amp;#039;m proven wrong and he does well in there. 2-0 United is my prediction.
