Stop hating and join in. This is the one shot that MLS really has at being considered a REAL LEAGUE worldwide. Everyone knew that the Becks deal was all about the flash and now with him leaving its blowing up in the leagues face.                       I know you have dreams of a second NY team returning as Cosmos with the salary cap lifted and each team being able to sign whoever they want... but that&amp;#039;s all it is, a dream.  There will be changes to the CBA, but they will most likely be with a slight rise in salary cap and developmental contracts.  We might see another DP slot or changes to the current one, but outside of that we&amp;#039;ll have the same restrictions on SIs.  The idea of having a mostly Hispanic team is just that, an idea.  Reality of MLS is far different of what Barca thinks it will have.
