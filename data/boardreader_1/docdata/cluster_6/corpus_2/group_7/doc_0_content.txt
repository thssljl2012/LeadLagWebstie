I think we can all agree that his talent on the field is something we want, but as a person, do we really want him back?  He clearly does not want to be here.  He has brought in his "team of lawyers" to try and keep him at Milan.  I think he believes a successful stint with AC Milan is his only opportunity to make the England squad for World Cup 2010, and he is probably right.    So, given the fact that he is doing everything in his power, utilizing his wealth, limitless resources, and fame to stay at AC Milan, do you really want a player to return from loan who will be angry with MLS, angry with the Galaxy, angry at Bruce Arena, angry at AEG, and just flat out dissapointed.      He is clearly a person who believes in county over club.  If he believed that coming back would secure him a spot on England's squad for 2010, then he would not even think of staying at AC Milan.  Agree or not????    I say let him be.  The league is not going to fold.  The league will continue to grow.  We will import more talent.  The next CBA can not be worse than the present one.  Players will be paid more.  We are going to get more soccer specific stadiums.  We will survive and prosper because we are too passionate to let the Galaxy fail or the league fail.    It is my opinion that he should not return, and frankly, we don't need him back.  Opinions Please.
