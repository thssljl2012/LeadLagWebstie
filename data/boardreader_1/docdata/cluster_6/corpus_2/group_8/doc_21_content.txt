My midfield is now (with kind help from others);   Cross   Pendlebury   VB  Boak   Rich  Dangerfield        Beams  Davenport     (Dont take notice to my interchange, that will be changed because of NAB Cup).     I only have 24k left in the bank, and I was thinking of maybe downgrading Cross to someone like Stanton eg.     Any ideas?
