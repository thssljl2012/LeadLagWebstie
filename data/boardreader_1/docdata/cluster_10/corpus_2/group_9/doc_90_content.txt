Very interesting banking story on Merrill Lynch purchase by BA.     Lewis Testifies U.S. Urged Silence on Deal - WSJ.com     The Wall Street Journal previously reported, in a   page-one story   on Feb. 5, that Mr. Lewis agreed to proceed with the Merrill merger only after Messrs. Paulson and Bernanke said that he and his board would lose their jobs if Bank of America backed out of the deal. Mr. Lewis's testimony with the New York attorney general's office corroborates that account.
