"Dealers agree to disclose more CDS trades: NY Fed" By Laura Mandaro Last update: 6:17 p.m. EDT April 1, 2009 "SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Major dealers and investors in over-the-counter derivatives agreed to report all credit-default swap trades not cleared through a central counterparty to a central trade repository, the New York Federal Reserve said late Wednesday.
