U.S. Stress-Test Accounting May Raise Capital Levels (Update1)   Share   Email   Print   A A A     By Craig Torres and Dawn Kopecki    April 25 (Bloomberg) -- Financial regulators may force many of the largest U.S. banks to raise new capital or conserve extra cash after accounting for assets held off their balance sheets.     The Federal Reserve yesterday released the methods used in stress tests on the 19 largest U.S. banks, which incorporated an accounting proposal that would bring about $900 billion onto lenders&#146; books.     The accounting change suggests most of the 19 will need to take some action to buttress their capital, analysts said. Stronger banks may keep dividend payments low or apply retained earnings, with others selling new shares to make up the amounts, they said.     &#147;We think that most banks are going to have to raise capital through some or all of those means,&#148; said Dino Kos, a former markets director at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who is now a managing director at Portales Partners LLC, a New York research firm. &#147;All of them will need to conserve capital through retained earnings.&#148;     Karen Petrou, managing partner of Washington-based research firm Federal Financial Analytics, said banks may need as much as $70 billion in new capital just to cover the added burden of the accounting changes.     Preliminary Results     Banks were given preliminary results from the stress tests yesterday, with final results due for publication May 4. The 19 firms include Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., GMAC LLC, MetLife Inc. and regional lenders including Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financial Corp.     Financial stocks advanced yesterday even as the report stopped short of indicating how much new money regulators will demand to be raised. The report said &#147;most&#148; banks have capital &#147;well in excess&#148; of regulatory requirements, without specifying how the stress tests would impact those levels.     The Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s 500 index rose 1.7 percent to 866.23, and the S&amp;P 500 Financials Index, which includes 80 banks, insurers, brokers and credit-card firms, gained 2.5 percent. The financials index is down 62 percent since the start of 2008.
