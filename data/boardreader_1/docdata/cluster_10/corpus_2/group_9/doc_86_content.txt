&#8216;Put Something in Writing&#8217;  Lewis testified that he asked Bernanke to &#8220;put something in writing&#8221; regarding the U.S. government&#8217;s plan to support Bank of America&#8217;s acquisition in view of Merrill&#8217;s mounting losses.  After Bernanke said he would consider the idea, Paulson called Lewis. He said, according to Lewis, &#8220;First it would be so watered down, it wouldn&#8217;t be as strong as what we were going to say to you verbally, and secondly, this would be a disclosable event and we do not want a disclosable event.&#8221;  Attached to Cuomo&#8217;s letter was a Dec. 22 e-mail from Lewis to his board. &#8220;I just talked with Hank Paulson,&#8221; the e-mail reads. &#8220;He said that there was no way the Federal Reserve and the Treasury could send us a letter of any substance without public disclosure which, of course, we do not want.&#8221;  Paulson said in his first statement that his discussions with Lewis &#8220;centered on the Fed lawyers&#8217; opinion that the merger contract was binding, and the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s commitment to ensuring that no systemically important financial institution would be allowed to fail.&#8221;   &#8220;No one at the Federal Reserve advised Ken Lewis or Bank of America on any questions of disclosure,&#8221; said Michelle Smith, a Fed spokeswoman. &#8220;It has long been the Federal Reserve&#8217;s view that questions of this nature are best addressed by individual institutions and their legal counsel, as they are in a position to understand clearly their obligations and responsibilities,&#8221; said Fed spokeswoman Smith.       http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJbR4ycD20iA&amp;refer=home       Former SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, who led the agency at the time of Lewis&#8217;s discussion with regulators, declined to comment.
