                                    NEW YORK -- Then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson threatened to remove Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis and the bank's board of directors if the bank backed out of its merger with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. last year, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said.  In a letter to members of Congress on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo said his investigation into the Charlotte-based bank's merger has found that Mr. Paulson told Mr. Lewis on Dec. 21, 2008, that the government "could or would" replace the bank's management and its directors if the bank exited the deal.   http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124045610029046349.html                                                 ...
