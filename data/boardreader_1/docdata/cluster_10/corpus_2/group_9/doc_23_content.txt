          Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary at the time, told Lewis in December that the management and board of directors of Bank of America would be removed if the deal wasn't closed, Cuomo said in a letter summarizing his findings to regulators and legislators.  Paulson told Cuomo's office that he made the threat at the request of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, according to Cuomo's letter.

Merrill was going down hard on their own and would have probably caused big losses with some trading partners.    I've wondered how BofA fit into the pecking order.  Apparently they're a few steps below Goldman, a couple below JPM and a step below Citi.    My wife has many accounting friends from back when she worked for BofA on SEC reporting.  According to some of them, BofA was really quick to cut all their subprime exposure before things got bad.  Then along comes Paulson and turns BofA's strength against them by making them take over Merrill.  Was the Countrywide mistake the result of similar pressure?  Goldman's tentacles run deep into the halls of power.
