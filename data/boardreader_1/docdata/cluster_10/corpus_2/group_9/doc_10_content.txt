Chrysler bondholders propose debt/equity deal Alisa Priddle / The Detroit News The U.S. Treasury is reviewing a counterproposal from Chrysler LLC's secured lenders that calls for a reduction in debt and an equity stake in the automaker for the banks.   The secured lenders are offering to convert their $6.9 billion in secured debt to a $4.5 billion first lien secured loan and a minority common equity stake in the company, said a source familiar with the counterproposal that was sent to the Treasury late Monday night.   That compares to original requests to convert all but $1 billion of the debt held largely by JP Morgan, Citibank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.   The source did not know the exact amount of the equity stake the banks would receive.   "We think this is a reasonable proposal and something Chrysler can handle," the source said, adding it is the banks' contribution to the call for shared sacrifice by all stakeholders, while protecting the rights of the debtholders.   Negotiations continue in Washington today with bankers, the United Auto Workers union, Chrysler, Fiat SpA, and Daimler AG all meeting with members of the autos task force as the April 30 deadline looms for Chrysler to cut deals with all stakeholders if it is to receive $6 billion in additional loans. The government announced today $500 million to help Chrysler get through this month.   A condition of the loans is finalizing a non-cash partnership deal with Fiat that would give the Italian auto maker a 20 percent stake initially in return for small car and engine technology.
