 STXS Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              13g a/o September 30...   all jmso, not investment advice...    During q3, the stock began around $5 and spent much of the q and October up around $7  (remember the persistent $7 trading?) before rolling over into the carnage of margin selling, hedge fund liquidations, mutual and hedge fund redemptions.  All that was accelerated last week as the market took another 100 floor header and all stocks with a &amp;quot;thud&amp;quot; in the story got slammed down to new lows -- particularly the small caps, but really everything in that bucket (see stxs, hnsn, goog, rimm, the shippers, the drillers, XOM and xto for examples).   Hopefully we are getting to the end of forced selling -- retail and pro now (note that Friday was redemption notice day for most hedge funds and essentially all institutional tax loss selling is now done on the october 31 cutoff), and it will be a relief to see some positive Form 4 news any day now if my hunch is correct that those guys are buying all the shares they can find down here.  Redundant, but the biggest puke would be to see the shorts, luckier than hell they got the broad market meltdown to bail them out on this name, cover in another 1m shares on the very cheap on the next settlement.    At the same time, those with windshield washer solvent left can see past the bugs on the windscreen as to whether STXS is going to be the dominant force in remote navigation in the world&amp;#039;s top EP labs over time.  In the latest 13fs, more than a few heard my sense that Timesquare was the major seller in here, and that is now documented as fact. They sold out 1,582,000 shares q3, leaving just 20k left as of 9/30/08.  Will they be one of the, what, 1000 or so hedge funds to be liquidated this year?    As to the current top 5 holders, a few of us were also right that while Trowe may make minor adjustments in some of there smaller funds, they are unlikely to gift away their big position in the future of EP.  TRowe sold only a few k shares, and still held 4,530,000 as of 9/30/08, likely with a basis substantially above $10, even though their baseline position (~5% from  recall) was on at the ipo.  Remember this: the portfolio mgr dropped out of being a doctor to manage money, and his fund has done exceedingly well over time; also, his wife is a pediatric cardiologist.     I also enjoyed seeing Vanguard, one of the most successful value and quality growth oriented funds of all time, was one of the buyers last q.  They added 149,000 up to 1,048,000 or close to 3% of the stock now, and Barclays added another 259k to 929k.      My favorite was to see that after selling out his hnsn q2 (he owned it last winter above $30 and sold it out sub $15ish without checking again), hos questions on the q2 stxs cc made it pretty clear he was short STXS then (above $7).  But check it out, during q3, he added 2500 shares of stxs between 5 and 7.  He really has been mr. pro wronway on this.    anyway, imo, the day after the FDA approval is in hand, it&amp;#039;s time for mgmt to schedule individual meetings now with all the mutual fund pros who bailed out down to $3-4 last March as the uncertainties and reasons for bailing will be over, Odyssey is ready to roar, the top labs are leading the way on throughput, the financing issues are addressed by JNJ and the VC group, and the fog is lifting on adoption and utilization if the order book for odyssey is an indication and the irrigateds are going to full Euro launch this week.    Call me an optimist down here if you want, but betting on a bkr when there really is no debt and financing is laid in for another 18+ months seems like a bad idea to me... and one lacking an understanding of what is happening now.
