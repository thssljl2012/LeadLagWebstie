          Anyone still think Barclays should have taken the govt money because it was cheaper? No strings my arse.   Yes but, no but, ....   you seem to forget that HSBC and BARC still have to compete with the Government backed banks in what will be an increasingly uncompetitive marketplace.   Whatever short term gain they may have in not bringing down their rates will be eroded by the loss of business to the banks that have cheaper mortgagae deals.  BARC should, if it could have, taken the government&amp;#039;s deal. That it didnt may have more than a little to do with it not wanting to open its books.   By withholding its books from scrutiny BARC runs a serious risk of becoming a &amp;amp;quot;zombie bank&amp;amp;quot; - one in which losses instead of being recognised and dealt with now will be massaged to be drip fed into the market with each set of results into the foreseeable future.
