          Personally I wouldny hold any of the UK banks and only intend to trade them short term. BARC isnt one that I would ever touch - there are just too many &amp;amp;quot;known unknowns&amp;amp;quot; and management has already &amp;amp;amp;*^ked the ordinary shareholders one time too many.     Yes Ducdorleans on this I agree. All the banks have shafted ordinary shareholders but BARC doubled up several times recently with placings diluting shareholders and offering them nothing. As a consumer my Barclays accounts and cards are in the process of being shut down and moved to a british bank
