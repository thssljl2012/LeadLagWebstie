         Hello Duc,   I tend to agree with WShak, ee has been consistently far too bullish on BARC (scratch that the ticker should now read ARAB) - basically BARC (ARAB) has had done to it what Buffet did to Goldmans &amp;amp;amp; GE only far more so.  I just dont buy the story that ee seems to accept that somehow BARC managed their risks far better than RBS. RBS opened its book for its 12B prospectus earlier this year - wrote off 5.9B and STILL had to come back for a further 20B!    I can&amp;#039;t recall WShak&amp;#039;s comment on the topic of my &amp;amp;quot;bullishness&amp;amp;quot;* on Barclays, but I&amp;#039;ve certainly preferred BARC to RBS - and I&amp;#039;ve not seen anything yet to change my view, despite the pasting  the BARC fund-raising terms have received.  *ie....they won&amp;#039;t fall as far as RBS...see  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=10772503    Over the last year the two shares are charted here:  http://tinyurl.com/5allfl   ....and despite the fall on Friday 1000 invested in Barclays a year ago would now be worth about 325 - approximately  double  the value of a similar investment in RBS!   ....which kind of says it all, I&amp;#039;d suggest!  ee   ps....are you related to jon277 who posted this  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=10826594  when RBS was about 480p last December, just after the dead cat bounce from 400p? Or were you just one of the losers who provided the 34 recs?
