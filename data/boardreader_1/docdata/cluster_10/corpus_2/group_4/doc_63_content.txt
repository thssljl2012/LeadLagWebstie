         I   was   overweight in banks. Here&amp;#039;s the performance, with divis reinvested:  Banco Santander = -79.9% Barclays = -65.4 Llyods TSB = -50.7% Ishares FTSE Divi plus (bought when banks large %) = 50.7%  I&amp;#039;m reasonably sure I&amp;#039;ve lost a lot more monetarily than the estemmed Mr Pyad. I should have followed Buffetts advice, where one of his quotes was something like &amp;amp;quot; I subscribe to no selection strategy looking for X, Y, Dividend Value or Z. As least there are lots of growth opps right now of the type he approves of.  Anyhow, the said financials only constitute 10% of my original HYP turned VP now, so I&amp;#039;m not overweight anymore, nor should I every be in the mid term ;-) Good job there was always the tracker to keep my head above water re capital protection.  I love to hear from any HYP guys who never invested in banks to see how their Portfolio has faired in the last 3 years.
