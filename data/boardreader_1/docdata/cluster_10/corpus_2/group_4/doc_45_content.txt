          Having had a good look at RBS&amp;#039;s exposure with their latest release I am now even more certain that BARC is a bank whose shares I would not touch   Why? What is Barclays exposure to conduits, for example?  Still too early to tell  where  one might want to have bank sector exposure, IMO.....   ee
