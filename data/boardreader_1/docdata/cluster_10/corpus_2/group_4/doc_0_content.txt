                                                       Perhaps worth noting is that Kashkari isn&amp;#039;t the only man in the Treasury Department who worked for Goldman Sachs -- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was once CEO there. Since Goldman Sachs is now a bank, which is regulated and subject to more scrutiny than it was as an investment bank, why doesn&amp;#039;t someone ask how much insurance does Goldman&amp;#039;s have at AIG? I would bet that AIG is getting this money because it has insured Goldman and Goldman is calling in its insurance for coverage.    I thought this whole bailout things was transparent and the transactions would be put on the internet....guess we were lied to.
