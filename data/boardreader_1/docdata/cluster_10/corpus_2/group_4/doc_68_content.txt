And about bleeding time! I&amp;#039;ve been calling bank shares to crash since Feb -- what have they been levitating on? Fair value for banks going forward is whatever produces a dividend yield above the bank bill rate. For CBA that&amp;#039;s under $30. If they cut dividends, it&amp;#039;s less.      All Ords: do us a favour! The main target is 3200-3400 from 2003-04. Should get there before Xmas. The bad news is building the US again. Should be another wave of the tsunami along any time now.
