 Well I wouldnt worry too much about the little people loosing their jobs because I bet most of them don&amp;#039;t have 5 or 6 investment properties negatively geared.  I would be more concerned about the forthcomming job losses in the banks such as St George when the merge with Westpac and the losses in the pipeline at the bank I work for.  When that happens I am expecting to see a lot of investment properties going on the market at bargain prices for a quick sale.
