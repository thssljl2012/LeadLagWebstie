         Yes, the 300 million commission issue is quite gauling.  However, going forward, and trying to be positive about the situation now that it looks like abstentions rather than rebellion will be the order of the day, the following points worth discussing:  1. Shareholdings will be diluted and there is a severe price to pay over quite a period for freedom from the Government. But at c160p that seems to have already been factored into the price.  2. No issue over dividend payments next year?  3. If Lehman purchase proves as much of a steal as Varley suggested, Barclays should already be profiting more than they could have anticipated as a result of the weak pound. And purchased when pound was stronger.  4. You would hope that Barclays become the bank of choice for businesses in the middle east from now on...a high tarrif but worth it?   These are the kinds of comments you would expect to be hearing at the EGM on 24th Nov?
