         Outrageous.  At the rate of interest they are paying, there will be nothing left for ordinary shareholders.  How dare they after sucking us in to a rights issue earlier?  Don&amp;#039;t they have to get shareholders&amp;#039; permission first?  Aren&amp;#039;t there are any large institutional shareholders left, or did the Middle East already have the Lion&amp;#039;s share? I have to say that our experience both as shareholders and customers/investors of Barclays has been appalling.  We intend to close our account and will not be investing any of what is left of our money after recent events with this bank.
