          I wondered if it the original rule (please don&amp;#039;t tell me that there are no rules) that being overweight in financials is a good thing still holds. In the end I decided that finance will still make the world go round and a well diversified HYP should benefit in the long run from a few well chosen financial shares. Of course without a crystal ball I can&amp;#039;t tell which are good and which are, to use a popular phrase, toxic. I decided to top up on Lloyds - about a half unit (either they will take Brown&amp;#039;s shilling and buy HBOS, and eventually emerge as a front runner, or they will not buy HBOS, and either not need the handout or have a smaller handout and so emerge much earlier); but not to top up on RBS (seemed a second choice to Lloyds). Barclays didn&amp;#039;t get a look in although I do hold it in another HYP. ...   Hmm... I thought that being a bit overweight in financials was a personal preference of Pyad&amp;#039;s rather than a rule!  Personally, I wouldn&amp;#039;t be topping up on the big banks as a HYP investment right now because of a much more basic HYP rule: companies you invest in should be expected to pay good dividends in the future. With the current prospect being one of at least a year or two of no dividends and an unknown level of dividends after that, I don&amp;#039;t think either RBS or Lloyds TSB qualify. Barclays might - their announced period of no dividends is just the final dividend for this year so far. But I&amp;#039;m not especially happy about them either after their fundraising announced on Friday: they&amp;#039;re paying a  lot  for the funds in my view, and I can&amp;#039;t see it being good for future dividends.  Not saying that investments in banks at current prices won&amp;#039;t turn out to be good ones - they might well! But their future dividend prospects (based on known announced information rather than speculation) are much more uncertain than I would generally be looking for in a HYP investment. So if I do buy any more of them myself, I&amp;#039;ll be treating them as a &amp;amp;quot;Recovery&amp;amp;quot; investment rather than a &amp;amp;quot;HYP&amp;amp;quot; investment.
