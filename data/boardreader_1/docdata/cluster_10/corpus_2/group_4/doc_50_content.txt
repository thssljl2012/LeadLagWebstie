         &amp;amp;quot;There is another angle to consider in the structure - the cost is tax deductible and in effect cheaper than Pref. Shares or am I missing something... &amp;amp;quot;  Yes you are.   1) HMG prefs are redeemable early unlike the Barclays notes which cannot be redeemed until 2019 so Barc are stuck paying a massive interest rate until then. Had Barc gone for the HMG arrangement they could have had another small rights issue in a year or twos time to pay back HMG prefs (or if their alleged good profitability continued, funded the redemption from retained earnings)  2) HMG prefs are not convertible to equity and do not carry warrants. Barclays allow most of the notes to convert to equity at about 155p a share!  3) The HMG offer to buy equity allows existing shareholders to take up the new shares instead. Barclays have taken away existing shareholders pre-emption rights.  Effectively we are giving away at least a third of our company for a song.  We should all be very angry.  At the time Varley rejected HMG funds he said they would have a rights issue so we would not be diluted. He is going back on that, probably becuase they are scared at having to open the books for a full prospectus thus revealing that their apparent profitability is down to a lack of conservatism on reserving for impaired assets.
