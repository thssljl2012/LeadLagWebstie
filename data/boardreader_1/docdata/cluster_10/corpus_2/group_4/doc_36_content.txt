The real problem is the ridiculous loans Fannie and Freddie were encouraged to give out to low income families that have now been defaulted on.  This is all well documented in the NY Times no less, back in the 90s it was the CLINTON administration that encouraged these loans.  Now the rest of the country gets to pay for that.  President Bush didn&amp;#039;t approve any of the loans, it&amp;#039;s not his fault we need the bailout.  My personal opinion is no bailout, let the banks fold and let the chips fall where they may.  Maybe then Americans would learn to spend what they can afford.                      Actually, that&amp;#039;s not entirely true.    Here is an excellent explanation of the TRUE root cause of the Wall Street crisis, from a friend of mine who&amp;#039;s an expert on operational risk management on Wall Street:    Step one: The problem started with securitization. Lenders traditionally relied upon deposit accounts to grow their business and finance new mortgages. But that is a slow way to grow your business &amp;amp;#8212; especially if like Countrywide you had ambitions to be the largest mortgage underwriter in the country. So the lenders started pooling mortgages together and selling them to investors. This gave them access to funds much quicker than the old fashioned way of attracting deposits. So the money came in quicker through selling off mortgages and the lenders no longer cared about if the mortgages could be paid back as they were now in the portfolios of investors. This changed the credit culture at the lenders and banks. So the lenders now cared about volume &amp;amp;#8212; the faster they could underwrite and sell off mortgages the faster they could grow their business. Their sales personnel were compensated for volume of mortgages they sold rather than credit-worthiness.     Step two: the larger the mortgages, the more the lenders could raise from investors. So there were banks such as Washington Mutual that used their influence to push up the valuations of new homes. So the appraisals came in at the level that the lenders wanted or the appraisal companies were fired. In some cases, as with Countrywide, the lenders owned the appraisal companies.    Step three: at the same time (around 1998) the credit derivatives market started developing. The original mission of the market was to spread around credit risk through what was essentially insurance policies that paid out if a creditor defaulted or met the definition of a &amp;amp;#8220;credit event.&amp;amp;#8221; Regulators gave the banks &amp;amp;#8220;credit&amp;amp;#8221; (ie, they did not have to put aside as much capital to cover their credit risks) that took out such &amp;amp;#8220;policies.&amp;amp;#8221; For a number of reasons (which are too complex for here), the risk ended up concentrated with the entities like AIG which were willing to underwrite these credit insurance contracts. Everything about credit derivatives (which include CDOs, credit default swaps, credit default securities) resembled insurance contracts with one exception: they were classified as &amp;amp;#8220;securities&amp;amp;#8221; rather than &amp;amp;#8220;insurance contracts&amp;amp;#8221; for regulatory reasons. This means that not only were they unregulated but the providers of the contracts, such as AIG, were not required to put aside capital to cover the potentiality that they would have to pay out on the contracts. There is something called capacity in the insurance industry &amp;amp;#8212; the amount of capital you have on your balance sheet determines how much capacity you have to underwrite new policies.    Step four: The CDO and mortgage-backed security market intersected. Insurance providers such as AIG started writing insurance contracts on CDOs &amp;amp;#8212; many of which contained subprime mortgages.    Step five: In August 2007 the credit markets came to a standstill as a result of increased subprime mortgage default rates. This meant that the underwriters of mortgages could no longer continue raising money through pooling off the mortgages that they had underwritten. The investors no longer wanted them. This led to a liquidity crisis for Countrywide and Northern Rock and other entities that relied upon the credit markets to raise cash to run their businesses.    Step six: As the mortgage lenders, CDOs, and other securities that contained subprime mortgages started to default, the credit derivatives contracts started kicking in. All of a sudden the underwriters of the credit insurance policies had to pay out on credit events they never imagined could happen and they did not have the cash. This led to a downward cycle &amp;amp;#8212; every time a default occurred there was pressure on the provider of credit insurance to pay out &amp;amp;#8212; when the provider of the insurance contract could not meet its obligations, another credit event would be triggered. At the same time the markets started capitulating in September &amp;amp;#8212; hedge funds, banks and securities firms started selling off good assets in order to raise cash, because there was no longer any market for the bad assets. This is what has driven the massive sell-off of seemingly good stocks by hedge funds.    Then there&amp;#039;s the role that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae played. They bought the mortgages from lenders, securitized them and sold them off to investors. Traditionally, they only bought (&amp;amp;#8220;insured) traditional mortgages that met certain criteria for a prime loan. But the US government over the past 8 years or so did put pressure on them to start buying and packaging subprime mortgages. This never should have happened. But although this played a role in the whole debacle, it was by no means the cause of it.     What drove this was securitization, credit derivatives, and the sophistication of financial engineering which got out of sync with risk management.    OK, this is TVMattNYC talking again, putting in MY two cents.  Just a reminder, this Wild Wild West atmosphere on Wall Street could not have happened without the myriad banking deregulation that occurred ... during the CLINTON administration.
