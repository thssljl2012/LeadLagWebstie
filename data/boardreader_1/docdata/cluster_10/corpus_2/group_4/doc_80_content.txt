This would be like flipping a coin. and the benifits would come years from now. too say that a stock with such a huge negative eps should be priced at $10,  or $20 is ridiculious. you are looking in the past and trying too price forward valuations,  and I think more than anything thats a huge mistake and one of the riskiest and most common one made. Another thing with hoping for that big of a return is the fact that most people will hold on too losers longer.... Theres better choices... if AIG why not Fannie and Freddie and others? I think the best thing too do if you want too gamble like this would be too buy a portfolio of those huge losers. I mean using youre form of valuations you would have too think that fannie freddie and other insurance companies like AIG as well as financials would have eqaully the same chance for those types of gains on their share price.  youre risk is spread out much much more,  but youre gains would remain pretty close. Either way youre bound too lose trying too bottom pick like this,  especially with companies so deep in the shit.
