     quote:      Originally posted by Slaughtermeyer     If you want to cash in on the bailout you can buy GM short-term bonds that have a maturity date of July 1 2009 and a maturity price of $25.  They closed at a price below $12 today so you&amp;#039;d more than double your money in just over half a year.  The ticker symbol for those bonds is GRM.           1. Buy those bonds   2. Buy insurance on those bonds at less than the spread   3. Gather ???   4. Profit!      ermmm, is AIG still selling credit insurance?
