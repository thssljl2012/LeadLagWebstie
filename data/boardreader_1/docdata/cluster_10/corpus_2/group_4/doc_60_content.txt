Secondly, you are competley wrong as to who the actual shareholders are and the amounts.      QIC were/are the largest shareholder with around 10%, Fang He is second with 8%(not 20 or 30%), Morgan Stanley are also another major shareholder with around 5%, with several other financial and super funds also having large stakes.                      I think you will find that most of the major shareholders have bailed out.  Go have a look at the company&amp;#039;s announcements.....      Macquarie Bank has even disposed their holdings.       Recent &amp;amp;quot;ceasing to be a substantial holder&amp;amp;quot; notices:       29 Oct Board Peak Master Fund Singapore (25m units)   11th Nov Morgan Stanley (5m) units   4th Nov Macquarie Bank (28m)   23rd October Challenger (3m)   2nd November CBA (5m)
