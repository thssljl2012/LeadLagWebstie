          At least Barclay owners will get a dividend next year. My guess it will be more than the shareholders think if RBS and Lloyds sell assets quickly, and badly, to repay the prefs.   ee said:    Thats a good point! I think RBS/LLOY will be busting a gut to get out of the Government&amp;#039;s clutches - and so there is something to be said for being a capable and potential buyer (at the &amp;amp;quot;right&amp;amp;quot; price). Bear in mind the Lehman deal and the expertise therein - asset trading might be a major element of next year&amp;#039;s business for Barclays as a whole!    I personally think that&amp;#039;s far too subtle a point, given the stinkiness of the central terms. It&amp;#039;s the equivalent of being smashed in the face by a boxer wearing gloves rather than a bare knuckled fighter and seeing that as a good thing.  Bottom line is that there is going to be much much worse dilution with this deal than the HMG one. There is going to be eye watering interest to be paid on the prefs as well. Barclays is clearly in no position to be buying anything until that debt is cleared, let alone pay a dividend.  In the past, Lloyds shareholders have claimed that their board is &amp;amp;quot;special&amp;amp;quot; but the evidence has since proved that to be nonsense. The evidence that Barclays now offer us is that they are a bunch of chancers who&amp;#039;s only real obligation to shareholders is to the latest lot that they are tapping up!  I&amp;#039;m afraid it&amp;#039;s looking increasingly like HSBC are the  only  bank in the UK that a suit is the most approapriate form of attire in the boardroom. The rest of them would be better off wearing balaclavas and carrying shotguns - at least that way, everyone would see them coming.  WShak
