         After reading the thread, particularly the first few posts of :-  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11294420&amp;amp;amp;sort=w...  one is inclined to think ill of the big deal recently done.   The facts of the matter now seem to me to be quite different....almost exactly the opposite.  It seems to me to have been a clever deal which leaves a Barclays holding as a sensible one to have.  Two key posts which lead me to this conclusion are:-    http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11295258   ....Complaints that they should have opted into the UK Government scheme are plain wrong. The 14% rate Barclays is paying is tax deductible, in contrast to banks paying 12% in the UK Government scheme. Barclays will be able to resume its dividends (now on a quarterly basis) much sooner than RBS and Lloyds TSB. which should make it attractive to income seekers.....     http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11296768    .......The headline rate of interest may look high (at circa 14%) compared to the 12% rate that the Treasury are getting on their prefs but the instrument that Barclays have issued is tax deductible and so on a post-tax basis Barclays are actually paying less. Also the instrument that they&amp;#039;ve issued (&amp;amp;quot;Reserve Capital Instruments&amp;amp;quot;) is marginally inferior to the preference shares that the Treasury were suggesting and gives them more flexibility.  The comment being passed amongst bankers is that Barclays couldn&amp;#039;t afford to take the Government&amp;#039;s offer othwerwise they&amp;#039;d have lost a huge (enormous) chunk of the earnings from Barclays Capital. Barclays are one of the biggest tax avoiders in the industry, see:  www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/special-report/article.html?in_ar... ... If the Government had become a big shareholder in Barclays then would they have continued to support Barclays&amp;#039; tax avoidance business? JakNife    I am certainly now of the opinion that Barclays, from an ordinary  shareholders point of view, is a better holding to have now than it was before the recent deal was brokered.   I expect that this will show itself in a change in the share price action of the next few days.  Glas.
