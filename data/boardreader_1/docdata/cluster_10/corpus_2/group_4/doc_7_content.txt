AIG wrote the policies that insured the CDOs issued by Wall Street, primarily Merrill Lynch. This was not a peripheral relationship - AIG&amp;#039;s insurance was essential to getting investors to buy into billions of toxic CDOs.

The Fed&amp;#039;s outstanding $2T+ in emergency loans and the backstopping of AIG is allowing this to continue, with the hope that banks will eventually work off the bad assets before everyone realizes that they&amp;#039;re all insolvent. The banks know this themselves which is why they wont even lend to each other let alone anyone else. In this environment nothing is in fact safe.
