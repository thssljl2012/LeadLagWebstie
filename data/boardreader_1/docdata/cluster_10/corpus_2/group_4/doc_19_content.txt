&amp;amp;quot;Who is profiting from all of these CDS deals?&amp;amp;quot;    Well prior to AIG&amp;#039;s solvency issues (likely brought about by the failure of the CDO markets via CDX&amp;#039;s) CDS were no different than any other insurance that AIG offered and recieved premium&amp;#039;s on. It would have likely continued to be profitable had there not been such a massive fallout on CDO&amp;#039;s.     &amp;amp;quot;But, if another former investment bank goes down, does it affect market liquidity the same way AIG and Lehman Bros. has?&amp;amp;quot;    no. the programs in place now prevent the freezing of liquidity by preventing counterparty failure.
