We plan to require top officials at both Merrill Lynch and Bank of America to answer this question and to provide justifications for the massive bonuses they paid ahead of their massive losses. As you know, my Office recently issued subpoenas seeking the testimony of former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain, as well as the testimony of Bank of America Chief Administrative Officer J. Steele Alphin. I expect we will also be seeking the testimony of other top executives at these firms.                   Quote:                  Bearing in mind that Merrill moved up its bonus payments in advance of its announced $15 billion quarterly loss and $27 billion annual loss, we have determined that Merrill Lynch made the following bonus payments:      * The top four bonus recipients received a combined $121 million;    * The next four bonus recipients received a combined $62 million;    * The next six bonus recipients received a combined $66 million;    * Fourteen individuals received bonuses of $1 0 million or more and combined they received more than $250 million;    * 20 individuals received bonuses of $8 million or more;    * 53 individuals received bonuses of $5 million or more;    * 149 individuals received bonuses of $3 million or more;    * Overall, the top 149 bonus recipients received a combined $858 million;    * 696 individuals received bonuses of $1 million or more.    Again, these payments and their curious timing raise serious questions as to whether the Merrill Lynch and Bank of America Boards of Directors were derelict in their duties and violated their fiduciary obligations.                Why do we put up with this shit.
