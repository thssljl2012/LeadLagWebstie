HAGERTY and DAN FITZPATRICK  ...mortgage-backed securities sold to investors...  ...among 17 issuers of securities backed by adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages, Bank of America's BAFC series has performed the worst, with payments on about 16% of the underlying loans 60 days or more overdue...   While lenders tended to be fairly careful with loans they planned to keep on their books, they took more chances with loans sold to investors.  In one category of securities sold by Bank of America in 2007, 98% of the underlying loans were made with reduced or no documentation of the borrowers' incomes....  The securities are backed either by jumbo loans, which are too large to be purchased by Fannie or Freddie, or Alt-A loans, deemed below prime quality, often because borrowers weren't required to document their income....  ...the mortgages kept on BAC's own books have done better than those sold in the form of securities. At the end of the fourth quarter, 3.2% of home mortgages held by the bank were at least 90 days overdue...  [end quote]  This is both a micro and macro story.  Micro: BAC was careful in its own mortgage lending. This is reassuring for those who are interested in buying BAC stock.  Macro: BAC was only one of many financial institutions that sold risky investments that it wouldn't keep for itself. This is at the root of today's financial crisis.  Wendy
