Bank of America ditches Countrywide name Posted Feb 19th 2009 12:15PM Bank of America's (NYSE: BAC) acquisition of Countrywide Financial has been a complete disaster, although it has mostly lurked in the shadows of Ken Lewis' other enormous screw-up, Merrill Lynch. In an effort to put the deal in the past, Bank of America has decided to plaster over the Countrywide Financial and replace it with "Bank of America Home Loans." The reason: Few people want to go to a company whose name is synonymous with mortgage fraud, housing bubbles, misleading sales tactics and foreclosures. Barbara Desoer, the executive in charge Bank of America Home Loans, tells (subscription required) The Wall Street Journal that the re-branding will be aimed at emphasizing that Bank of America is a "responsible lender." With all the bad press Bank of America is getting -- bad corporate governance, writedowns, taxpayer bailout, etc. -- I wonder whether they wouldn't be better off renaming Countrywide Financial something completely unrelated to either failed company.
