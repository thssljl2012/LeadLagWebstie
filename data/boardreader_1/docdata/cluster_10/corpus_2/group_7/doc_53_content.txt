From his posts, I've gathered that the existence of a stock on the SHO list is a non-event.  Millions of fails is a non-event.  However, he has been praising the reduction of stocks on the SHO list as some sort of event.  This event being that it was all a non-event to begin with.      Obviously all these things are non-events.  That's why the Refco bankruptcy details have been sealed from the public.  That's why trading records are not disclosed to the public.  That's why the DTCC's records can never be disclosed to the public and that's why the hard T+3 rule is not enforced.  No regulation or enforcement is actually necessary.  Self-regulation is all that is needed because we all know that Goldman Sachs, Bear Sterns, JP Morgan, Lehman, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, et al are run by a bunch of very rich, very smart, very honest men who would never put their pocket books ahead of the shareholders.  Because nothing bad like the systemic meltdown of the US and world's financial systems could never happen .....                  thread start
