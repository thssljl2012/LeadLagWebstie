Do you think pink sheet stocks are more scammy than Bank of America (BAC)? Brower Piven Encourages Investors Who Have Losses in Excess of $500,000 From Investment in Bank of America Corporation to Inquire About the Lead Plaintiff Position in Securities Fraud Class Action Lawsuit Before the March 23, 2009 Lead Plaintiff Deadline Hmmmmmm, maybe! How about Citigroup (C), Lehman (gone), Bear Stearns (gone), Merrill (soaked up) and many other blue chip stocks that fell victim to bad management under deregulation?!? But it's good to know the crooks got their bonuses anyway! Some pink sheet stocks are less scammy IMO! Volkswagen is on the pinks!
