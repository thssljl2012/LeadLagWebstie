In July, IndyMac was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp,  which took over its assets, including mortgages that were modified and  promoted as a model for future loan modifications. In January it was  announced that a private investor group was buying IndyMac assets from  the FDIC.    Countrywide Financial Corp, which was also regulated by the OTS and  faced mounting mortgage losses, agreed last year to be acquired by Bank  of America Corp.
