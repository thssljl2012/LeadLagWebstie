Inside the Meltdown examines what Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke didnt see, couldnt stop and havent been able to fix.     http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meltdown/   Showing tonight at 9 Eastern.  The website will happily tell you when your local station is airing it.  CalculatedRisk put in a note about this show.  Probably not much new stuff for people here who've been following this disaster, but you might want to give it a look.
