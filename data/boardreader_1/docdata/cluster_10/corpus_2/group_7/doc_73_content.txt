       BOSTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Bernard Madoff's alleged massive financial fraud has sparked more outrage as news circulates a major U.S. bank may have cashed out early while other investors were left high and dry.  The New York Times reported on Thursday that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) suddenly began pulling its money out of two hedge funds that invested with Madoff last fall before Madoff was arrested, but did not tell investors.  According to the newspaper, JP Morgan said its potential losses related to Madoff are "pretty close to zero."
