Since the receiverships for Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual, where bond holders took a near total loss, these foreign investors have been vocal in demanding that US taxpayers protect them from further harm.&lt;    I would take a wild-assed swag here that if anything happens to certain banks as a  result of the stress tests  (e.g.unka converts his preferred for common equity) we already know what the models. are...AIG and FNM, FRE, where the subordinated debt survives....  i suspect it is institutionally widely held enough (like the senior bonds) that any deferrals  in the trups  would result in such fear among the senior bondholders that a meltdown would occur regardless. Also, I cannot believe TSY will do a big bang but are more likely to   roll out bank solutions one at a time. So I think C will be the guinea pig            thread start
