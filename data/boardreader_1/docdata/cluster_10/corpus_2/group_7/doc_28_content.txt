Bank of America chief executive Ken Lewis, however, has said the notion of nationalizing his bank is "absurd" and that it has not come up in his talks with government officials. At the end of the fourth quarter, Bank of America's assets exceeded its liabilities by $177 billion, or about 10 percent. That compares to about a 9 percent cushion at the end of 2007. Former Bank of America executive Christopher Marshall said the bank also has a "unique ability" to generate profits -- and necessary capital -- once it gets through the downturn, noting it produced more than $20 billion in net income in its peak year. The bank also could generate $15 billion, he estimates, by selling off noncore operations and stakes in China Construction Bank and Brazil's Banco Itau. "I think Bank of America has a lot of cards to play," said Marshall, who is also a former chief financial officer at Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati.
