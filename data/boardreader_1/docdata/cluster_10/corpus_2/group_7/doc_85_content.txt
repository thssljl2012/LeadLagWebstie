Bernanke points to the most troubling part of nationalizing the banks-will the resulting lending be any better if it is state-directed rather than by the formerly private banks? Most likely not.     February 19, 2009, 8:20 am   Bernanke Cites Drawbacks to Nationalizing Banks     Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, expressed skepticism Wednesday about the prospect of nationalizing troubled banks and suggested that President Obama's administration would much prefer to keep financial institutions in private hands.     His comments, at a luncheon at the National Press Club, came shortly after his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, told The Financial Times that temporary nationalization of some banks might be the "least bad solution" to the current banking crisis. Many were surprised that Mr. Greenspan, long a fan of self-regulation in the financial sphere, would even suggest such a move.     "As a general rule, it's very challenging for governments to manage banks for a protracted period," Mr. Bernanke said Wednesday after being asked about Mr. Greenspan's comments, The Charlotte Observer reported.     Later, he added, "Whatever action would need to be taken at one point or another, there's a very strong commitment on the part of the administration to keep banks private and return them to private hands as quickly as possible."     The notion of putting ailing banks under government control has been popping up more often lately among analysts and economists.     Fears of a potential government takeover have weighed on shares of Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. The bank's chief executive, Ken Lewis, has dismissed such speculation as "absurd."     The new Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, have given little indication that any such thing is under consideration. "Governments are terrible managers of bad assets," he recently said.
