                          Replying to:  Which, ladies and jellyspoons, was why they were in trouble in the first place, and why they'll be in trouble again as soon as they burn through the cash.All we've done is pay them for mismanagement.  Why isn't that as painfully obvious to everyone as it is to me?    Posted by adrenalynn   Wells Fargo was NOT in trouble.  They initially tried to refuse the TARP money and were basicly told to take it or else by Paulson.  WFC is probably the best run major bank in the country.    http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122402486344034247.html :     During the discussion, the most animated response came from Wells Fargo (WFC) Chairman Richard Kovacevich, say people present. Why was this necessary? he asked. Why did the government need to buy stakes in these banks?  Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Executive John Mack, whose company was among the most vulnerable in the group to the swirling financial crisis, quickly signed.  Bank of America's (BAC) Kenneth Lewis acknowledged the obvious, that everyone at the table would participate. "Any one of us who doesn't have a healthy fear of the unknown isn't paying attention," he said.    They're also the onlyTARP participant to pay a dividend on the stock owned by the FDIC.   http://www.thestreet.com/story/10461392/1/wells-fargo-pays-treasury-3715m-dividend.html?puc=_tscrss    So now the most stable bank in the country is being lambasted for taking money they didn't even want, thereby forcing them not to spend money in the economy.  Great way to stimulate the economy.
