Might be worthwhile watching Frontline tonight with something to throw at the TV to make you feel better:      "Inside The Meltdown: FRONTLINE investigates the causes of the worst economic crisis in 70 years and how the government responded. The film chronicles the inside stories of the Bear Stearns deal, Lehman Brothers collapse, the propping up of insurance giant AIG, and the $700 billion bailout. Inside the Meltdown examines what Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke didnt see, couldnt stop and havent been able to fix."
