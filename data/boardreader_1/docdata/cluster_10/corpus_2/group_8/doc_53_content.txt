Mar 23, 2009 11:00:49 (ET) By Joe Bel Bruno Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Bank of America Corp. (BAC) gave tentative support to the U.S. government's blueprint to buy toxic assets from banks, but it's still trying to determine how the plan would work. "We are in favor of the concept but are studying the details," said BofA spokesman Scott Silvestri. The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank has received $45 billion in government funding to boost capital and stabilize the business. Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said he hopes to pay back the money by late this year or early next year. Earlier this month, Lewis said the bank has performed well during the first few months of the quarter and was on track to record a first-quarter profit. Shares of the company began to rebound after his comments, and were up 16% at $7.18 in recent trading Monday morning. -By Joe Bel Bruno, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4047; joe.belbruno@dowjones.com
