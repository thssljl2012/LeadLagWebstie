You can also "save" a bank by nationalizing it. Look at Citi. The government converts its preferred shares and dilutes the common and urges other preferred owners to do the same. At the end the equity holders of a couple of days ago will end up holding just 20% of the company - and there is a chance that the government has to build up a higher equity position in the near future.
