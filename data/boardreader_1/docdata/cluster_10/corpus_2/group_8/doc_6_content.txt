This morning, Moodys slashed its outlook to negative. Ditto for Wells Fargo.    To me, JPMorgan Chase is the most worrisome of all. After all  it is Americas largest bank with a market value thats greater than Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup combined!      Remember: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. holds $91.3 trillion in derivatives  a notional value thats 40.6 times its total assets  including $9.2 trillion credit default swaps, hands-down the riskiest form of derivatives.      Worse, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency warns that JPMorgan Chase Bank is also exposed to extremely large credit risk with its derivatives trading partners: For each dollar of capital, the bank has credit exposure of $4.00  nearly twice the average exposure of Bank of America and Citibank.                                             What this article fails to mention is that yes JP has exposure but they will probably profit from bankruptcy of its trading partners (CDS).       Regardless, why the "last standing" bank in US is allowed to have a credit and derivatives exposure to the tune of almost ten times the US national GDP, remains a glaringly unanswered question.
