bank of america, citigroup (especially citi) and other major banks in south such as capital one, wacovia are in deep funding trouble right now, starting in 2007, bank of america&#039;s primary effort is to get funds from their chinese sources.      my best bet on banking right now, as well as investment banking is that wamu. yea, wamu has a good relation in the asian market. it&#039;s funding is prolly the best among huge national level banks within the united states.
