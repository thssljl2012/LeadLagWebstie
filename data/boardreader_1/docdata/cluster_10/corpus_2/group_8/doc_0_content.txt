                    BofA chief calls Merrill aid mistake            Quote:                         Bank of Americas request for $20bn of government money to prop up its acquisition of Merrill Lynch was a tactical mistake that made the bank appear as weak as Citigroup, Ken Lewis, BofAs chief executive told the Financial Times on Monday.      But Mr Lewis said he would stay on as CEO of the North Carolina-based bank until it paid back the $45bn of government money it received under the US Treasurys bank recapitalisation programme, possibly within two to three years. This is the first time he has signalled his plans to leave the company.      However, he expressed regret that an abundance of caution had led him to take more aid than he said was necessary to absorb Merrills $15bn fourth-quarter loss.      BoA received an initial $25bn from the Treasury in September. It requested a further $20bn at the end of December as the scale of Merrills losses eclipsed BofAs initial forecasts.      In hindsight, it was a tactical mistake because it put us in the same category as Citigroup, said Mr Lewis. We could still have had 8 per cent tier 1 capital after a $15bn loss but we wanted a cushion.      Mr Lewis said that it would have been better to request only $10bn for that purpose. He said that could have helped to curtail investor fears that further problems were in the offing.      The scale of government assistance for Bank of America and Citigroup has helped fuel speculation that outright nationalisation could be necessary for one or both banks. The fears have contributed to a 76 per cent drop in Bank of Americas share price since its acquisition of Merrill Lynch closed on January 1.      Mr Lewis has come under fire for paying close to $20bn to acquire Merrill Lynch just as the ailing investment bank was posting $15bn in fourth-quarter losses, and then asking the government for aid to keep the deal afloat.      The deals troubles, together with controversy over Merrill Lynchs payment of bonuses in December, have prompted calls for Mr Lewis resignation but he said this was an option he had not considered for one second.      I want to repay the Tarp money before I go anywhere, and by then I think we will be seeing the success of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, he said. It would be very easy to disappear into the sunset but we have to slug through this.                      http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/50000286-0...077b07658.html                                                                                                     document.write('  ');
