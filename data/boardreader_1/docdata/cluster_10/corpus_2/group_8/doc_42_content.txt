 BAC Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Re: barons   Banking's Evil Twins? Not Exactly   By JACQUELINE DOHERTY (Barron's)    (grabbed from another board)    BANK OF AMERICA ISN'T CITIGROUP. it shouldn't need to raise more equity and dilute shareholders. It will post a profit in the first quarter and all of 2009, absent a market meltdown worse than what we're now seeing. And, when the economy recovers, it will be an earnings powerhouse.    That's the message chief executive officer Ken Lewis is delivering to anyone willing to listen -- including Barron's, which he visited last week.    Investors, however, are skeptical.      CEO Lewis of BofA hasn't been smiling much since buying Merrill Lynch -- acquiring losses that were larger than foreseen, along with a storied brokerage operation.   The bank's stock (ticker: BAC) was skidding toward $3 late last week, versus $37 a year ago -- off by 91%. Citigroup (C) shares plunged an even more precipitous 95%, dropping from $21 and change to a buck in the same span.    CITI'S SWOON HAS BEEN exacerbated lately by the announcement that it will boost its capital base by converting much of its preferred stock into common, diluting the interests of existing common shareholders. That's precisely what bears say will happen at Bank of America . And the coming government "stress test" of banks' financial strength has fanned further doubts about the bank. The test's nature is known; its specifics aren't.    But BofA has a chance of averting Citi's fate.    The measure of capital adequacy favored by many big investors is tangible equity -- equity minus goodwill -- as a percentage of tangible assets. It gives them a feel for how much of a cushion a bank has left to absorb losses on loans or securities gone bad. BofA's tangible equity ratio is 2.68%, and its tangible equity as a percentage of risk-adjusted assets is 3.6%. Lewis theorizes that regulators would like to see banks' tangible equity at 3%, and says that BofA should get there by the end of the year. But 4% is the number often discussed by investors.    Citigroup's tangible equity, now at about 1.5%, is expected to jump close to 4% after it converts its preferred, as my colleague Andrew Bary recently noted ("Fixing the Banks," March 2). In contrast, JPMorgan 's (JPM) tangible equity is 3.8%, and will improve now that the bank has slashed its dividend by 87%.    To boost tangible equity to 3%, Bank of America would have to raise its equity base by $8 billion, assuming that the total amount of its assets remains unchanged. The equity needed would be lower if the assets were reduced. BofA hopes to reach 3% through a combination of retained earnings, asset sales and shrinking its balance sheet.
