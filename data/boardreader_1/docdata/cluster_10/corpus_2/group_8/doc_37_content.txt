       Consider what John Thain did for the private and "venerable" New York Stock Exchange, what NYX shareholders have now (all-time low today), what he did for Merrill Lynch shareholders, and Bank of America shareholders, and what they have now, and what this has cost and will cost U.S. taxpayers, and what he did for himself.  Was he worth the total of what he got paid at NYSE, NYX and MER? Only for the NYSE seatholders who cashed out, and only for the MER shareholders if he knew MER was in trouble when he charmed Ken Lewis into paying "$50 billion" for what could barely stand, and for the MER shareholders who sold before BAC crashed, but that may cost the U.S. taxpayers $100 billion.  There has been and is too little outrage at compensation packages and exit packages that have no relationship to lasting results.
