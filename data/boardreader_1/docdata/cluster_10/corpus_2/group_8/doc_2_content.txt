Wells Fargo slashes dividend 85 percent to 5 cents Wells Fargo slashes dividend 85 percent to 5 cents for expected annual savings of $5 billion NEW YORK (AP) -- Following the lead of other major banks, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. said Friday it will slash its dividend in an effort to save $5 billion annually. The San Francisco-based bank said it will cut its dividend to 5 cents from 34 cents. The next dividend is expected to be declared in April. Wells Fargo is the latest of the money-center banks to succumb to the decision to cut its dividend to shore up capital as a buffer against future losses. Last month, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents from 38 cents. In January, Bank of America Corp. slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny from 32 cents. And troubled Citigroup Inc. has lowered its quarterly dividend to a penny from 16 cents. Furthermore, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and U.S. Bancorp cut their dividends earlier this week. Other smaller regional banks have made similar moves. Although Wells Fargo has long been considered one of the stronger players in the banking sector, the company has recently faced increased scrutiny from analysts and investors who are worried about its capital levels. There is concern that losses related to the company's acquisition of troubled Wachovia Corp. will be bigger than anticipated. In recent weeks, its stock has taken a beating as investors fear it could be the next big bank in need of a government bailout. Following initial injections of $25 billion into the nation's top four banks including Wells Fargo, the government has had to pump billions more into both Citigroup and Bank of America to stave off a major failure. Wells Fargo's shares have fallen 72.5 percent so far this year. The stock has lost 25 percent this week alone. In premarket trading Friday, Wells Fargo shares added 51 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $8.63.
