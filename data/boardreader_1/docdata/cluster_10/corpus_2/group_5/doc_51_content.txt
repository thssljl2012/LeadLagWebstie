(IDMCQ) give a misleading picture of its financial health, the Washington Post reports Monday. Darrel Duchow allowed IndyMac to include money it received in May in a filing describing its financial condition at the end of March, according to findings by Treasury Department Inspector General Eric Thorson, the Post said. The filing was made just months before federal regulators took over IndyMac in July. As director of the OTS western region, Duchow was responsible for regulating other banks that failed or were sold last year, including Washington Mutual (WAMUQ), Downey Savings and Loan, and Countrywide Financial, which was bought by Bank of America Corp. (BAC). Dochow did not immediately respond to requests by the Post for comment. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said he received a letter from Thorson on the findings. "The Inspector General says this backdating of a capital infusion to meet bank capitalization requirements with the blessing of the Office of Thrift Supervision was not an isolated incident," Grassley said in a statement. "What does that mean about the real financial condition of other banks? And what does it mean about the independence of the Office of Thrift Supervision? The role of the Office of Thrift Supervision, as the name says, is to supervise these banks, not conspire with them."
