Dennis Kneale   CNBC Media &amp;amp;   Technology Editor   Upside: Maybe we can avoid another round of outrage from Congressmen and other whiners who are shocked-shocked!-that anyone on Wall Street could get paid so handsomely, much less actually deserve it.     Downside: Thain gets screwed out of what rightfully was his, for he did deserve a bonus, for myriad reasons. Same goes, arguably, for Morgan Stanley chief John Mack and the seven senior execs at Goldman Sachs, all of whom will forgo any year-end payout. Worse, this whole kerfuffle may embolden the self-righteous, sanctimonious mob that now decries wealth creation and the profit motive. Where were all these populist prudes when the stock market was rising 63% from 2003 through October 2007? Answer: They were fat and happy and counting their money.     It's one thing when a greedy fatcat utterly fails his shareholders, guts his company and walks away with an undeserved windfall. Two lamentable examples: the $42 million parachute for Charles Prince, who flopped at integrating the smokestacks of Citigroup and let it plunge head-first into the subprime debacle; and the $160 million sendoff for Stanley O'Neal, accumulated over an entire career at Merrill Lynch before he looked the other way while his traders loaded up on wild-eyed risk.     John Thain, by contrast, was brought in only a year ago to fix the Merrill mess, and he worked 24/7 to do it. Troubled rivals Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns dilly-dallied-rather than swallow their pride and sell themselves to healthier partners-and they went belly-up, pretty much. Thain, by contrast, handed Merrill [MER 13.52 -0.58 (-4.11%) ] over to Bank of America [BAC 15.90 -0.79 (-4.73%) ]. Since mid-September, just before that deal popped, the stock price of Citigroup [C 7.94 -0.36 (-4.34%) ] is down 43% and Goldman [GS 72.81 1.28 (+1.79%) ] is down 46%-but Merrill shares are up 5%.     That's a gain of more than $1 billion in market cap for that floundering firm, so a $10 million bonus barely is a rounding error. Ten million bucks, in fact, is equivalent to how much revenue Merrill collects in just 20 minutes, based on a 40-hour work-week.     Yet now we're gonna take pleasure in stiffing John Thain? Sounds a little punitive to me.     This CEO backlash, moreover, could spread far beyond Wall Street to infect the entire U.S. economy. Yet, last year, median pay rose only 1.3% and bonuses fell by 5% for the CEOs of more than 230 multibillion-dollar companies, even as their stock prices rose an average of 7.5%, says the research firm Equilar. At financial giants the median pay package fell 20% in 2007, and Wall Street now braces for haircuts of 40% to 70%.     Okay, so some CEO pay is way out of whack, and too often mediocre performance is rewarded richly. In the late 1970s the bigwigs earned an average of 30 times the rank-and-file worker's paycheck, and by this decade the gap widened past 300x. But this owes mainly to the fixes put in place a decade ago, in an earlier crusade to reduce CEO pay. Comp critics wanted to tie CEO pay more closely to a company's stock performance, so stock options came into vogue and, in the long bull run that followed, the rich got vastly richer.     But trying, yet again, to ensure a corporate chieftain doesn't earn &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot; money is a matter best left to boards and shareholders-not to politicians and union demogogues and irate day traders. (My favorite new tack: clawbacks.) Alas, I don't hear anyone suggesting we cut the pay of other culprits in this crisis: Barney Frank and other lawmakers for inflating the Fannie-Freddie housing bubble; Securities and Exchange Commission chief Christopher Cox for letting risk run amok; and tens of thousands of people who lied about their finances to land super-cheap loans to buy more house than they could afford.     Oh no, that would be wrong-let's take it out on the CEOs. It's more fun that way.
