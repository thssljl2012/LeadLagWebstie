Yet Wall Street gets billions thrown at them without any of the scrutiny and begging that the Big 3 are having to do. And if Detroit goes down the economic impact will be staggering. It's not just going to be the employees of the Big 3 but their suppliers, trucking firms, the rail road, dealers, etc....There will be more jobs lost if GM went down than any of the banks that were rescued.      really...maybe but I do not have the stats on the layoff picture.      I do know WAMU. US BANK, CITI BANK, Bank of America and other banks have layed off quite a number of employees and continue you to do so.      As for GM...they own GMAC which finances auto ownership!
