 US Bank Corp (USB) has their dividend record set for the 26th of December. They have a 7+&amp;#37; dividend. If you buy the stock, you could have a quick gain even if the price goes down a little after the 26th. Might make for a quick profit. But of course there is a risk. I put in a buy at 23.60. If it doesn't go through, then I can change the purchase price on Friday.    I also bought some GM convertible preferred stock (GPM) banking on the bailout and some ONEOK PARTNERS (OKS) which is a gas utility.
