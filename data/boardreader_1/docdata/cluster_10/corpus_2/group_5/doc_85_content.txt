  Interesting story about what is happening with the initial mortgages that were restructured:       Loan servicing companies have been voluntarily reducing mortgage interest payments under plans such as the private sector Hope Now Alliance, which is made up of financial institutions such as Citigroup and Bank of America.      The OCC data shows that about 36% of borrowers who got restructured mortgages in the first quarter were more than 30 days overdue after three months, said U.S. comptroller John Dugan.       That rate rose to 53% after six months and 58% after eight, he said. The remarkably high figures were similar during the second quarter, Mr. Dugan said.
