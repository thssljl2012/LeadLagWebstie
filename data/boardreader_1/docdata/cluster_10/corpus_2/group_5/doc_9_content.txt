Buying opportunity for solid companies coming? That is the conventional Buffett wisdom, buy solid, well managed companies at the bottom of a crash. Problem is, which companies are solid and well managed these days. All the big banks and GE could well end up like Citibank. No one knows what landmines are on their books and you can&amp;#039;t believe what they say. Banks typically have said, &amp;quot;no problems, looking good, manageable exposure, BOOM, BK.&amp;quot; It is possible that the BofA, Wells Fargo, GS, and GE could all end up zombies.
