                        One thing I might add about the US Bank reports.  I expected the number of delinquencies and foreclosures would remain small since the bulk of the principal on these notes had been paid down and the Mortgagees would be walking away from real equity.  In reality, the delinquencies are foreclosures are alarmingly large and growing - comparable to the overall mortgage market as a whole, I suspect.  These things reduce the amount of the I/O strips that we might recover, so it's a bit of bad news.  That said, the good news is that there is still a good chunk of income coming to the Creditors Trust from US Bank every month.
