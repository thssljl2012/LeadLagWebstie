       Derivatives are like a tarp, their use is to hide the true value of assets. Hence the enormous amount of funds which have been poured into AIG insurance. AIG is one of the primary tarps, or fig leaves, which make assets in other firms appear to be sound.  I&amp;#039;m not saying reflation efforts might not work, I&amp;#039;m just saying the score is currently reflation 1 vs. deleveraging 10, and I would suggest no one has ever successfully done so before.  The traditional perspective is that economies grow out of an economic depression over time. The losses in capital have occurred over a number of years as economically redundant homes and other investments were built and created, destroying the capital used in the process. An economic depression is the sudden realization of these prior losses, resulting in a contraction of credit and spending.  Printing more money, through currency swaps currently,  does not  replace the missing capital. This is the fundamental problem, even if everyone ends up with ten-times more currency.  Hence Joseph Schumpeter&amp;#039;s quotation:   http://siliconinvestor.advfn.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25230818
