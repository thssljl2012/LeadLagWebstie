The current economic climate and hit to their market cap has hastened and illuminated the need to cut, but it's been there for months.                      This is very true!     BOA has taken on way to many companies, now they can't even handle all of what they have bought. They are a mega bank that believes bigger is WAY bigger and because of this I will not do business with them.     In October 2007 they bought all of the LaSalle Bank's throughout the nation, and still have not made a totall transition yet. Last May they put plastic tarp's over the LaSalle signs and now many of them are still up and falling apart and the bank is so large that they don't care about a few Michigan banks.
