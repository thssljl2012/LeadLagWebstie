From the   Financial Times        S&amp;amp;P downgrades 11 of world&amp;#8217;s top banks      By Jane Croft in London and Greg Farrell in New York   Last updated: December 19 2008 18:30      Eleven of the world&amp;#8217;s biggest banks were downgraded Friday by Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#8217;s after the ratings agency said the current downturn could be longer and deeper than previously thought.    Six major US banks were downgraded, including   JPMorgan Chase  ,   Bank of America   and   Wells Fargo  , as well as five banks in Europe.    The agency cut its ratings on   Citigroup  ,   Morgan Stanley   and   Goldman Sachs    by two notches each. In Europe, S&amp;amp;P shaved one notch off the ratings of Barclays,   Credit Suisse  ,   Deutsche Bank  ,   Royal Bank of Scotland   and   UBS  .     While the downgrades were driven in part by the worsening economic climate in the US and abroad, S&amp;amp;P noted specific causes for concern at each institution.     S&amp;amp;P analyst Tanya Azarchs said that, in addition to the economic woes, the banking sector&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;lax underwriting standards due to excess competition mean this cycle will be worse than prior cycles&amp;#8221;.    UBS saw its rating fall from AA- to A+ as S&amp;amp;P highlighted the extremely high level of losses suffered by the Swiss bank since the start of the business cycle, reflecting &amp;#8220;larger risk concentrations and weaker risk management than we had previously perceived&amp;#8221;.    Deutsche Bank also saw its ratings lowered from AA- to A+ as S&amp;amp;P pointed out that it viewed asset quality &amp;#8220;as likely to weaken materially and risk management to be weaker relative to risks&amp;#8221;.    Barclays was downgraded from AA to AA- as S&amp;amp;P said that although Barclays had diversified its loan book many of its geographic exposures were in countries such as Spain and the UK, where it believed there was potential for a severe slowdown.    S&amp;amp;P also singled out Barclays&amp;#8217; increased exposure to capital markets from the acquisition of the former businesses of Lehman.     The agency also downgraded Royal Bank of Scotland from AA- to A+, despite the 20bn of capital it has received from the UK government. It said the bank had been lossmaking in the first half and it expected earnings to remain severely under pressure.    S&amp;amp;P also downgraded Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, raising questions about the ability of both investment banks to thrive after their conversion to bank holding companies.     But, of the two, S&amp;amp;P was more negative on the outlook for Morgan Stanley.     &amp;#8220;We view Morgan Stanley as very much in a turnaround mode and we do see somewhat more potential for further deterioration there than at Goldman Sachs,&amp;#8221; S&amp;amp;P credit analyst Scott Sprinzen said Friday.    Bank of America&amp;#8217;s acquisition of Merrill Lynch also raised concerns, particularly since Merrill could generate more writedowns in commercial real estate and leveraged loans. Despite BofA&amp;#8217;s history of integrating companies it acquired, &amp;#8220;the purchase of Merrill Lynch carries unique integration risk&amp;#8221;, the agency said.
