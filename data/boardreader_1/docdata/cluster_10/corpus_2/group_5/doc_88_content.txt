                 AP   Banks promise they won't use bailout money for pay   Thursday November 13, 10:34 am ET   By John Dunbar, Associated Press Writer   Bank executives promise that bailout money won't be used for executive bonuses or pay      WASHINGTON (AP) -- Executives from four financial institutions that have received a total of $75 billion in federal bailout funds are promising they won't use the money to pay their executives and employees.      The executives made the pledge Thursday in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. Lawmakers have reacted in anger to reports that banks might use the bailout money to pay bonuses to their executives, acquire other banks or finance other business takeovers.      Jon Campbell, regional banking president for Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co., told the committee his company doesn't need the government's investment to pay for bonuses or compensation and will not use it for that.      Executives from Goldman Sachs Inc., Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. made similar pledges.       Little known in the news: 3 days ago, AIG employees were caught in Phoenix, Arizona, Squaw Peak Resort, having a huge time. This is after AIG has blown through 1.50 Billion in Bailouts. Must be nice to be a liar.                                          __________________       Not Everything that looks straight is: Until you measure it.
