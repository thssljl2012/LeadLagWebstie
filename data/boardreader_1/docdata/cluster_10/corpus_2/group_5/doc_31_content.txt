 Hey All!!!  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Just An Interesting Read:  &amp;amp;nbsp;  More than half of homeowners fell behind on mortgage payments in the first six months after their loans were modified earlier this year, new data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision show.  The high redefault rates raise questions about the effectiveness of efforts to work with troubled borrowers at a time when the government is facing increased pressure to do more to reduce foreclosures. &amp;quot;The numbers are larger than we thought they&amp;#039;d be,&amp;quot; Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan said in an interview.&amp;amp;nbsp;  The data, released Monday, cover loan modifications by the 14 largest national banks and thrifts, including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co., which together account for more than 60% of mortgage loans outstanding. The lenders modified nearly 73,000 loans in the first quarter and an additional 114,000 in the second quarter.  Nearly 36% of borrowers were more than 30 days past due three months after their loan was modified, and nearly 53% were more than 60 days late after six months, according to an analysis of modifications completed in the first quarter, going through Sept 30. Some of the borrowers got back on track after missing a payment, but more than 41% were more than 60 days past due after eight months. Redefault rates were slightly higher for modifications completed in the second quarter.&amp;amp;nbsp;
