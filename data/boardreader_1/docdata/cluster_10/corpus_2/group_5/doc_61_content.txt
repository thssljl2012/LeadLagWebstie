Bank of America to cut up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years it will eliminate between 30,000 and 35,000 jobs over the next three years due to its acquisition of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc. and a faltering economy that is affecting the level of business activity at the bank. BofA has not completed its analysis and expects to have a final number in early 2009, it said in a statement. A cut of 35,000 jobs would represent up to 10.5 percent of the combined BofA/Merrill work force. http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2008/12/08/daily53.html
