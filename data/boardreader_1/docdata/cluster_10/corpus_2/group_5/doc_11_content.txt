Merrill chief Thain withdraws request for bonus      WASHINGTON (AFP) &amp;amp;#8211; Troubled US bank Merrill Lynch said chairman and chief executive John Thain has withdrawn his request for a bonus this year amid rising public anger Wall Street&amp;#039;s role in the country&amp;#039;s financial crisis.
