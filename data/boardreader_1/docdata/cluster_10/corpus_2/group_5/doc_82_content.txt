This CEO orchestrated the sale of Merryl at nearly $30/ share.  Shares now trading at $15 or so.  He saved  his shareholders a bunch of $$$$ .  Maybe this guy actually earned the bonus        Also, Merryl was a house of cards like the rest when he got in as CEO last year, so the drop from $50/ share can&amp;#039;t be blamed solely on him.      I&amp;#039;lll let you guys get back to bashing the rich........                           Cie,      I&amp;#039;m not bashing the guy because he&amp;#039;s rich.   Thats great for him.  I am appalled at his decision to ask for a $10 million bonus in this current economic climate with so many people in the financial services sector out of work, including BOA and Merrill.  Yes he and his team negotiated the merger with Bank of America and saved the firm.  That is commendable.  That is also his JOB.  He also has a large equity position in Merrill, over 700K shares, so it was in his best interest to negotiate a merger, else he lose it all.  Certainly someone as smart as him could&amp;#039;ve anticipated the outrage, not to mention the bad press, this would garner for his company.  He&amp;#039;s already backed off on requesting the bonus.  Maybe he realized it was the wrong decision at the wrong time.  I only know what I&amp;#039;ve read in regards to specifics.  Perhaps you can enlighten us as to why he should get the bonus.      Ben
