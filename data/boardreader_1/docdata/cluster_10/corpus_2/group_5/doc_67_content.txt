The bank should cut its quarterly dividend to a penny from 32 cents and conserve as much capital as possible, Miller wrote in a report issued today  as the stock closed at $14.11 . He rated shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America underperform. Miller finished first among bearish analysts in a June ranking of the worlds best stock pickers compiled by Bloomberg.     While Bank of Americas capital will be rebuilt over time, we expect that it will have to raise a substantial amount of new common capital to jump-start the process, which will dilute existing shareholders, Miller wrote.
