 Fuld isn&amp;#039;t employed by Barclays. In case of confusion, that&amp;#039;s a Barclay&amp;#039;s Bank logo you have on him and all the stormtroopers, but it&amp;#039;s entirely inappropriate since he&amp;#039;s not on their payroll.  Amusing Photoshop, but also quite misleading.   Barclays has bought a big chunk of Lehman brothers, but Fuld doesn&amp;#039;t work for them; he still works for Lehman, and is currently administering their bankruptcy procedures (most of the subsidiaries have been sold off to other banks, but Lehman technically still exists).   Personally, I think Fuld is getting a really bad rap. It looks to me that, as the smallest bank on Wall Street, it was decided that they could safely be thrown to the wolves and Lehman was deliberately shafted by the Fed and the other large banks. For example, Fuld begged the Fed to allow him to reorganize Lehman as a commercial bank; they refused, but a mere week after Lehamn declared bankruptcy, they allowed JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs to do exactly that.   So Fuld made a lot of money over the last 8 years. I have no problem with that; Lehman used to be a star bank and had an outstanding reputation, punching far above its weight. Fuld worked there for 40 years, starting out as an ordinary clerk and eventually rising to become CEO...which is how you&amp;#039;re supposed to do it. Now he&amp;#039;s being scapegoated for a lot of stuff that was never in his control to begin with. He&amp;#039;s not broke, so I don&amp;#039;t feel too sorry for him, but at the same time I think he is catching a lot of blame right now for the action of others.  don&amp;#039;t get distracted: Dick Fuld is not the big bad evil genius of Wall Street, he&amp;#039;s the designated whipping boy. As best I can tell, Lehman went down because they actually tried to do things by the book.  You might find this interesting:  http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry  ...  Lehman Brothers may have been defrauded out of more than $350 million (175.8 million) in an alleged Japan-based scam of epic proportions and sophistication. Tokyo-based investigators said that the alleged confidence trick, which involved meetings at the headquarters of one of Japans most famous corporate names, could have been pulled on many more Japanese and Wall Street investment houses.  Lehman Brothers has already filed a criminal complaint and today plans to sue the Marubeni Corporation over its refusal to pay back the money apparently loaned with its backing to a now-bankrupt fund at the heart of the alleged fraud. Lehmans exposure, which emerged when the fund failed to make a payment in late February, has triggered two other regulatory inquiries. The Financial Services Agency is understood to be looking into Marubenis involvement, while the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission has begun investigating the case on suspicion of insider trading by contacts of the alleged fraudsters.  There&amp;#039;s a lot more to this than meets the eye.
