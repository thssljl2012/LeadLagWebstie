Given what has happened since their collapse in the private world wide financial markets for mortgages, no one cares any  more about Fannie and Freddy. They only lost about 200 billion, but the private banks  lost trillions, and caused a credit crunch that is endangering the economy of the US and Europe. US taxpayers are on the hook  for over a trillion dollars for the bailout, FDIC insurance for failed banks, and a 100 billion for AIG, European governments have put out about 1.5 trillion, and Iceland has gone bankrupt.
