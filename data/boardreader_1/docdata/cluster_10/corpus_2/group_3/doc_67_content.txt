       Mr Fuld, who has been testifying on the financial crisis before the US House Oversight Committee, was attacked on a Sunday shortly after it was announced that the banking giant was bankrupt.  Following rumours that the incident had occurred, Vicki Ward, a US journalist, said &amp;quot;two very senior sources - one incredibly senior source&amp;quot; had confirmed it to her. &amp;quot;He went to the gym after ... Lehman was announced as going under,&amp;quot; she told CNBC. &amp;quot;He was on a treadmill with a heart monitor on.  Someone was in the corner, pumping iron and he walked over and he knocked him out cold.    &amp;quot;And frankly after having watched [Mr Fuld&amp;#039;s testimony to the committee], I&amp;#039;d have done the same too.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;I thought he was shameless ... I thought it was appalling. He blamed everyone ... He blamed everybody but himself.&amp;quot;  Lehman Brothers, which was particularly badly hit by &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; mortgage debt, filed for bankruptcy last month. Its assets were later bought up by Barclays.  In a robust performance in front of the committee, Mr Fuld said that he would wonder &amp;quot;until they put me in the ground&amp;quot; why the US government had not rescued the 158-year-old firm. He said that regulators were fully aware of its plight well before its collapse.  Mr Fuld said: &amp;quot;I want to be very clear. I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took based on the information that we had at the time.&amp;quot;  However he faced angry questioning from the committee&amp;#039;s members. Henry Waxman, a Democrat, asked: &amp;quot;Your company is now bankrupt, our economy is in crisis, but you get to keep $480 million (276 million). I have a very basic question for you, is this fair?&amp;quot;  Mr Fuld said that he had in fact taken about $300 million (173 million) in pay and bonuses over the past eight years.      http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/f...thers-gym.html
