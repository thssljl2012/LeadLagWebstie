         I expect, like many others, my Sipp has been badly hit in the last month.  Despite knowing that you should move away from equities as you approach retirement, I still managed to get toasted.  Equities are what I understand, and what is talked about on the discussion boards, so I have never really thought about Gilts.  I suppose they are just not as exciting as an imminent SOCO deal for example!  But I think now may be the time to move into gilts.  However, looking round the Sippdeal site, there is very little information about purchasing Gilts.  Also, I searched for &amp;amp;quot;gilts&amp;amp;quot; on this board - not one match!  An old list of Gilt tickers can be found here:-  http://www.iii.co.uk/articles/articledisplay.jsp?article_id=...  and trying in Sippdeal outside market hours, they sort of work until you get a script error.  This article also mentions that you specify the trade quantity using the nominal value, then have to adjust for accrued interest.  There may also be an option to specify a trade value, but this may not work properly out of hours in Sippdeal.  Now, I also remembered that there are these iShares, and indeed there is one for Gilts, ticker IGLT:-  https://cert.barclays-stockbrokers.co.uk/navigation/cat_nav_...   This allows you to buy a basket of gilts but more like an equity.  Now, the things about gilts is this:-  &amp;amp;quot;Gilt prices rise when the Bank of England cuts the base interest rate...&amp;amp;quot;  http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/InvestmentGuides/Bonds/a...   and with comments that the Government may slash interest rates in the coming months, now may be the best time to buy them.   Except of course everyone else already knows this, so some of the expected increase may already be in the price.  So, can anyone comment about holding Gilts directly in Sippdeal, about trading IGLT, about the prospects for gilts in the coming months, and should we all be considering them!  Regards Mick
