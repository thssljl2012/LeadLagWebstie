          That said, if they could raise capital without needing the government capital injection, then would be a big plus on two fronts... it&amp;#039;d mean no dilution and the banks remaining in control, and secondly, it would demonstrate that they are actually reasonably strong!   According to the statement the banks have committed to do this by the end of the year. What it doesn&amp;#039;t say is what minimum capital ratios are required. Whatever is happening in the wider world I am sure the banks are still making money. At the same time they will be reducing their risk assets. So in theory the capital ratios should improve between now and the year end.   The big question is, is there any appetite out there for further cash raisings. Clearly the first port of call will be the sovereigns. They have suffered as much as anyone but presumably they will be taking the long term view. Certainly in the case of HSBC, Stan Chart and Barclays I feel that they will raise whatever is neccessary without government help.
