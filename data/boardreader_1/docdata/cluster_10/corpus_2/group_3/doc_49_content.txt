 I trade on the stock market for a living (at the moment).      This market is absolutely perfect for trading, and I make more in a couple days than most of my friends do in a month. Technical charts indicate the Dow Jones isn&amp;#039;t going to bottom out until it hits at least 7000.    We&amp;#039;ve had a few sucker rallies, but the bear market is still going strong, we&amp;#039;re only 12 months in... the bulls aren&amp;#039;t going to be released for a long time, so brace yourselves!      If you are an investor, DO NOT PANIC SELL. Selling out at a massive loss now is stupid, because these things are cyclical and the market -will- recover.      If you trade on the ASX, keep an eye on LNC and CXY for long term investments. Also some of our financials, like CBA and WBC are going cheap, so watch them like a hawk.
