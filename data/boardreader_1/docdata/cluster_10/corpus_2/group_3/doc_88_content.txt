The claim was that AIG&amp;#039;s failure would put undue pressure on the deposit insurance fund, not that it would bankrupt it.                      OK, you say BS and then spout off a bunch of unrelated facts?  Do you not understand the legal makeup of businesses, the complexity of AIG, the role of the FDIC, bankruptcy code, English, or all of the above?   Let us try this one more time, slowly... AIG is NOT a bank.  AIG was NOT FDIC insured.  AIG owned a banking subsidiary.  The deposits in that subsidiary were insured.  They were a small portion of AIG&amp;#039;s total business.  If the FDIC were to have to step in to cure those deposits, it would be allowed to remove the bank from the company in whole, and take assets from the parent to cure the depositors.  The fact is that the FDIC would not have had to throw a single dollar into the mix because the parent company had sufficient assets to cover all of the deposits it held.  And, again, the deposits are the only thing the FDIC insures, not the company itself.   In the worst case scenario, the FDIC would have closed the bank, taken the deposits, and had a first tranche claim against a forced bankruptcy of AIG that would have been paid before any other creditor.
