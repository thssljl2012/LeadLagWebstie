The five-year Markit iTraxx Europe index &amp;amp;lt;ITEEU5Y=GF&amp;amp;gt;, at around 121 basis points, was 5 basis points wider than the 10-year index &amp;amp;lt;ITEEU10Y=GF&amp;amp;gt; on Tuesday, said Graham Rennison, a quantitative credit strategist at Barclays Capital.      Inverted spread curves often indicate that investors see a heightened risk of default in the near term. Ten-year spreads are tighter, because of expectations the default cycle will pass and spreads tighten over the  long  term.      The curve inversion in this case is being driven by the one-year to three-year end, Rennison said.      &amp;amp;quot;There has been an increase in the buying of  short -dated protection on single names as people are concerned about jump-to-default risk,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      ...      Even though some of the indexes are illiquid, &amp;amp;quot; the pattern is real and too striking to be just a statistical anomaly ,&amp;amp;quot; Rennison said.      ...      Either way, &amp;amp;quot; what we expect from now on is that you are going to see more activity at the front end of the curve, even for investment-grade companies ,&amp;amp;quot; Rennison said.      ...
