 NOVS.PK Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              GETTING SHORTER ???????    The credit crisis is causing a contraction of the little-noticed but huge business of securities lending, and financial players including pension funds, insurers and hedge funds are paying a price.    Losses are sparking lawsuits from customers who pursued securities lending as a way to squeeze additional gains with seemingly little risk.   Northern Trust   Corp. and   Wells Fargo   &amp;amp;amp; Co., which run programs for institutional investors with securities to lend, were sued last week by clients who alleged that they mismanaged money and, in the case of Wells Fargo, deceived the clients about the nature of their investments and degree of losses. Both companies are defending against the suits.    Securities lending programs, which combined have represented at least a trillion dollars, involve lending securities to short sellers or others and investing the collateral for gains. The strategy for many has lately backfired as once-reliable credit investments have seized up amid market woes.                      In recent weeks, the city of Hartford, Conn., and other institutional investors have suspended their securities lending programs.   State Street   Corp. and other large custodian banks have restricted investors from exiting from the programs. And insurers including   MetLife   Inc. and   Chubb   Corp. are trimming or winding down their programs;   American International Group   Inc., has suffered more than $15 billion in unrealized and realized losses.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    -------------------------------------------------------------------    &amp;amp;nbsp;    The above is a snippet of an article from the Wall Street Journal for those who want to read the full article. I think a lot of instutions lost a ton of money lending out securities to Lehman Bros. Check out ESLR    &amp;amp;nbsp; Evergreen Solar seeks return of shares in lawsuit against Barclay, Lehman Brothers         MARLBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Solar-panel maker Evergreen Solar said Tuesday that it has sued Barclays and Lehman Brothers, seeking the return of 30.9 million shares it loaned to Lehman Brothers in July.     The lawsuit filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York specifically demands that Barclays immediately return 12.2 million shares that Evergreen Solar Inc. said Barclays obtained from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. after the New York investment bank filed for bankruptcy protection this summer.   Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, following a swift and stunning fall linked to bad investments and turmoil in the credit markets. Barclays, the British bank, subsequently absorbed the company&amp;#039;s key U.S. units.   The 30.9 million shares were loaned to Lehman Brothers as part of a $375 million financing Evergreen Solar completed in July. Following the bankruptcy, the shares were not immediately returned to Evergreen as required by the contract with Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; European affiliate, Lehman Brothers International, Evergreen said.   Evergreen said Lehman Brothers International has refused to respond to demands to return the shares or say who has them. Barclays also has refused to return the shares.    ------------------------------------------------------    &amp;amp;nbsp;    These are the people that screw the small investor by lending out shares to the detriment of the various mutual funds owners so the management of the funds can make more money. I hope a ton of these institutions lose millions&amp;amp;nbsp; on the Lehman Bankrupcy. Maybe then the management of the funds would put their future employment &amp;amp;amp; the fund investors interest above getting a few extra bucks than management tales anyway. All in MHO    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Kirby
