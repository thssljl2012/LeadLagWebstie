CNBC and Vanity Fair contributor Vicki Ward said Fuld was attacked at the gym on a Sunday following the bankruptcy.                      Frankly, I sat there and listened and Im with the guy who apparently, the day before Barclays announced they were coming in and Lehman had already filed for bankruptcy, went over to him in the gym and punched him because thats how I feel when I, you know, when I watched that, Ward said on the Oct. 6 Power Lunch. I didnt think he was contrite at all, I thought he was arrogant.             i wonder, if you had to get pummeled into unconsciousness repeatedly before you were able to file for Chapter 11.... who would go through with it? _________________ Right and Wrong are just words, what matters is what you   do           Susie  - a work in progress     Clyde  - ya mule!
