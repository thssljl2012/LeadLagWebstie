When an active market for a security does not exist, the use of management estimates that incorporate current market participant expectations of future cash flows, and include appropriate risk premiums, is acceptable.  ... Well, better late than never I guess.                           What&amp;#039;s the point of the 700billion &amp;quot;rescue&amp;quot; plan. Our appointed officials are doing it while giving congress-taxpayers the finger. Fed-FDIC spent $250billion yesterday guaranteeing debts of Wachovia, now SEC modified &amp;quot;mark to market&amp;quot;. Actually, it&amp;#039;s not a bad idea if you want to protect sellers of CDS like AIG, the insurance never gets triggered and your balance sheet looks good without any writedowns.          http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080930/financial_meltdown.html            Quote:                         Another possible change to the bill would modify &amp;quot;mark to market&amp;quot; accounting rules. Such rules require banks and other financial institutions to adjust the value of their assets to reflect current market prices, even if they plan to hold the assets for years.      Some House Republicans say current rules forced banks to report huge paper losses on mortgage-backed securities, which might have been avoided.                             Mccain is out of touch. wallstreet is frightened. mainstreet is angry. maybe he didn&amp;#039;t get enough angry email/phone calls from ****ed off Americans.

He said, &amp;quot;Americans are frightened right now&amp;quot; and political leaders must give them an immediate solution and a longer-term approach to the problem.
