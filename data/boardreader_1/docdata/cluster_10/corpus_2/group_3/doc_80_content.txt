         Barclays in a worse position?  Well yes and no.  The market does not trust RBS, that is the simple fact.  As I stated here a week or so ago, RBS has no friends either, no particular must havebanking side that might provoke a SW fund or similar.  Barclays has branches all over Africa and the Chinese will buy it at the right price.  Wait and see it happen.
