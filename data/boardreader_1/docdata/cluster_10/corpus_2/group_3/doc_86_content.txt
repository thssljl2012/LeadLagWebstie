 Barclays close to raising US$9.8 billion from private investors in Qatar and Abu Dhabi.  This may act as a signal for other private investors to snap up investments in the Western banking sector - investing alongside with the government (a la Bill Gross):         http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122541741109586847.html?mod=testMod                   Quote:           Barclays needs to raise funds to meet new U.K. government capital benchmarks for its banks as part of the government&amp;#039;s 400 billion bailout plan laid out earlier this month. Barclays Chief Executive John Varley had until March to raise all the money, and the early move to secure funds is likely to refute skepticism that the bank might have trouble in choppy markets.        While some of the U.K.&amp;#039;s biggest banks have turned to the government for funding, Barclays sought to avoid selling shares to the U.K. government, a move that would carry conditions such as a limit on dividend payments to shareholders and would give the government a say in some board seats. Barclays also talked with two Russian banks but nothing has come from it.        Barclays&amp;#039;s capital plans could result in other investors providing capital. Barclays also plans Friday to announce its interim financial update. It had been scheduled to report next month. The report is aimed at calming investor concern about the impact of the market turbulence in recent weeks.
