RBS and Barclays do not even need or want new capital, yet it appears they will now be forced to take it, as all UK banks will now be required by the Government to have a minimum of 7% capital.  This is simply a matter of restoring confidence in the banks, and it now looks like the Government is at last taking the necessary steps to do that.  Expect to see a large rebound in banks share prices in the morning.
