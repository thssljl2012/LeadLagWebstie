Is the real impact a loss of any future borrowing, aka no opportunity for growth or to buy more Biotronik leads?                           Companies have to buy insurance for their bonds, the rate on that insurance can increase or decrease based on lots of parameters, the fact is most of those parameters are looming bad for BSX. The rate to the borrows is much the same, but BSX must also pay huge insurance premiums to companies like AIG that insure their worthless paper. That combined with the $700m judgement (nice liability on the balance sheets), and other market issues-make for really tough times and choices at BSX.   Tobin has to be at least looking around the room for the guy with the knife, and where he put his parachute (like he hasn&amp;#039;t been looking for a couple of years now!).   I don&amp;#039;t know about the confidence level of the sales force, but if I worked there and didn&amp;#039;t have my CV w/a headhunter, I would now!
