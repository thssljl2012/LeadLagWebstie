I use H as a helper column for the MATCH formula =MATCH(RC1,Banks,0).     In VBA, RC1 is column 1 (same as column A where you said the banks are).     Are you sure you did as I did and said, which was to put that list of banks            Bank         Morgan S        Wachovia        Bank of New York        Credit Lyonais        RBS        Barclays        Credit Suisse        Citibank        JP Morgan           on another sheet, and name that range you have them in as &amp;quot;Banks&amp;quot; (without the quotes).     If your data is set up differently than you said, post back, but this workd great when I tested it.
