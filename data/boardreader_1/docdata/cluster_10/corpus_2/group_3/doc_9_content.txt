         With the exception of the dividend suspension nothing has really changed since last week. All the Government has done is put an end to the uncertainty. Whilst it might have been preferable to have announced this all together last week presumably they needed the extra time to look at the numbers and get the actual capital requirements right.   All things being equal there should be more than plenty in the pot to withstand whatever the market throws at us in the coming months. We just have to believe that Barclays will come out of this stronger in the long run.
