What is not gotten is that a derivative position can have total possible exposure of, in the case of JP Morgan, over 75 trillion. But the value of that liability is a tiny fraction of that on a default swap, because defaults are very rare events. So they would report a liability of say 75 billion. They sold these swaps for 90 billion, OTC, and netted a profit of 15 billion. This is not false accounting either, for instance, a leap-type put that is 20$ OTM (out of the money) is an 'asset' worth maybe pennies per contract. But if the stock moves down suddenly (bankruptcy), this asset can multiply in value by hundreds, instantly. This put would be a nice hedge against a CDS.        But if that default does happen, the contract of the swap states they are liable, as kind of an insurer, for the full value of the default, which obviously is going to be alot more than 15$ or whatever they sold it for. It will be probably 50 or 100 to 1. So then their liabilities instantly become 7.5 trillion, and their assets unchanged.        Obviously, not all swaps default simultaneously.. but even if only a small fraction do, it could make them worth negative trillions..        You would have to see their positions, to know the true situation!        Yes, JP Morgan had 70 trillion + of derivatives exposure.        I think the day JP morgan or Citi publishes a list of their derivatives positions is a cold day in hell.. and the day their stock goes to 0 instantly.
