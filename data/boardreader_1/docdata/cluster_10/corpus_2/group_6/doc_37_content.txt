Interesting read seemingly pointing out there aren't easy answers IMO assuming WaPo analysis has no agenda.   ----------          Dont harm golden goose  what China should learn from Opec          [snip]    The first rival account is that the crisis reflected failings of US  financial regulation. Such failings exist, but most have been around  for years.    The mortgage bubble reached its craziest extremes in 2005-07, when China was flooding the world with cheap capital.    Moreover, regulatory failings exist not just at one regulator but many.    The Securities and Exchange Commission failed to check risks at  broker-dealers such as Bear Stearns. State insurance regulators failed  to prevent the collapse of AIG.    The Federal Reserve failed to see that banks were pouring capital  into toxic securities that they then held off their balance sheets.    European regulators were no better, even though they had adopted a supposedly more up-to-date set of capital standards.    The lesson: Faced with a deluge of cheap money, no regulatory regime can be expected to prevent bubbles.    The second rival account of the crisis accepts that its origins lie less in regulatory failings than in economic pressures.    But it blames the bubble on two mistakes at home rather than on the glut of capital from China.      [snip]    The bubble that China inflated has brought Chinas foreign customers  to their knees. Because China pushed its export model too aggressively,  its export markets have cratered.    Think of it this way: Chinas position is akin to that of Opec in  the early 1980s. Two oil shocks taught oil producers the limits to  their power: When they jammed prices up, the world economy sputtered  and motorists bought smaller cars  and oil prices fell precipitously.
