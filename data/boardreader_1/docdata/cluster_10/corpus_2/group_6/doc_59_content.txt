 From my analysis, they will not go bankrupt as US govt will keep pouring money into the Citi pit. Citigroup is a very bad buy, there are many more worms in the can not dug out yet.        BoA has good fundamentals but dragged down by merrill lynch which has many bad "assets". Its real value shd be ard $6 or less.        If wanna make money, buy wells and fargo now for short term.. 1-2 weeks shd earn ard US$1 per share at least.
