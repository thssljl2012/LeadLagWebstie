Bank of America       $ 7.18    Citibank                   $ 3.50    Well Fargo                $18.68    JP Morgan                $22.82    GE                           $13.96    Ford Motor                $ 2.19    Morgan Stanley        $15.59    AIG                          $1.42        BIGGEST DISCOUNT SALES EVER!!!! If you are dreaming all these years to own their sales, the time is here. BUT BUT do you have the guts to go in now??                From the list above, US probably will not allow most of them to fail..BoA, Citi,JP,MS, AIG at least..but must hold and hold till don't know when?maybe &gt;5 years or more..
