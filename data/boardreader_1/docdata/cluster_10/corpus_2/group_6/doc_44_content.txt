Yak...I'm just wondering how long this group will continue to attack, yes attack, Sanswire, for that is what this action is. Whether it is another company, the fund of another country, or simply the nefarious action of a group able to steal all the market cap of a company from investors intent simply on greed because they have the capital to accomplish it. The U.S. government instituted the securities exchange act of 1934 with the express purpose of preventing this...when and how did our government become so corrupted that it no longer acted in the best interest of investors? We are all aware of the 5 hedge funds, all market makers in Lehman as well as lehman depositors that got AIG to accept an insurance contract at 3 times market cap and then pulled all their funds after shorting Lehman...effectively colluding in a failure that gained them 4 times the market value. Do any of us expect our government regulators to enforce existing regulations on collusion and conspiracy to affect a change? Too bad my thoughts will doubtless make it past the moderator let alone the beyond this board...but they must be voiced just the same if not for the only purpose of my own sanity. jmho ed
