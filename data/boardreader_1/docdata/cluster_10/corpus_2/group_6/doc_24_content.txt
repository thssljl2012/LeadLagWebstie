 BAC Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Now, Let's examine Sarge's record trading BAC ... DOWN 71% in 60+/- Days         And for your next LIE ... your ego is too big NOT to respond to my message (but you say that you have me on Ignore).         LOL                    Msg : 2076 of 2504     10/9/2008 8:48:25 AM               Author:    SargeK               send pm      add member to favs      ignore      recommend             Strong Buy                                                           Recs: 1         Keeping Score     Since 10/06/08, when I resumed accumulating BAC shares in my trading account, this is the record:       Date Price #Shares Cost    10/6/2008 $32.85 400 $13,140.00    10/7/2008 $28.04 400 $11,216.00    10/7/2008 $27.66 200 $5,532.00    10/7/2008 $24.07 1000 $24,070.00    10/8/2008 $21.85 2000 $43,700.00       Total Cost of $97,658.00/4000 shares = $24.41 PPS       The purchases yesterday concludes the accumulation phase. Now I wait. I will sell no shares below $26.50.    Distribution will begin with 1200 shares, which will pay off the margin loan instituted yesterday. After that, the fun begins, trading several times a day (assuming volatility continues and daily spreads between High and Lows exceeds $2.00) picking up small numbers of shares on profitable trades.       Like the previous accumulations beginning in June 2008. I again entered too early; but I am not displeased with the future yield of 5.24% ($1.28/$24.41) on core holdings because I believe Ken Lewis, when he said:       "We know many investors in our stock are quite disappointed with a dividend reduction," Lewis continued. "It is not a decision we made lightly. However, we cannot pay out what we have not earned. Our goal is to resume dividend increases from the new level as soon as our earnings performance warrants.       "All that said, our company continues to be profitable, and we have been able in the last year to make a number of moves that should significantly enhance our earnings when economic and financial market conditions improve. Our diversity and scale give us strength to deal with the current issues that few competitors can match. I have never been more optimistic about the long-term prospects of Bank of America."  http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=71595&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1205990&amp;highlight =       I believe yesterday's lows established a firm price foundation, but with reintroduction of "short selling"; nothing is assured nor will temporary spikes below those levels be unexpected. Just do NOT panic and sell at exactly the wrong time. FWIW       Good luck to all,       SargeK       Note: I expect signficant B of A price recovery to the $30s within a few weeks beginning TODAY! I also think BAC is a bell-weather issue that will serve as both a leader and general barometer of the market indices.

LMAO         Can you say lying, cheating, slimey, pump and dump pond scum.         SargeK, you are the epitome of the saying "even a blind squirrel finds a nut every now and then".         After all that non-stop trash talking bloviating BULLSHIT of "To the Moon" crap and now you run like a scared girl just as the big Bail Out is about to happen and the "Safe" dividend that we never in question in your mind is now in question?         You are an absolute hoot, and the truth be told, you probably did no better than break even on this whole insane in and out "I trade around my core position" Jim Cramer parrot speak.                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Msg : 1936 of 1936     9/23/2008 5:12:15 PM               Author:    SargeK               send pm      add member to favs      ignore      recommend             Hold                                                       view thread ,   thread start         In response to  msg 1935  by  retirein2019                           Recs: 0         Re: B of A up to $45.00 this week!     I meant to say this year - raising my previous forecast by $5 bucks by XMAS. After watching the Senate Finance committee today, I am changing the forecast to $45 - $55; by the end of 2009. I sold the remaining shares in my trading account this AM and will not do any trading until I have a more confident feeling in the general direction of the economy, Also, I am not left with a warm and fuzzy feeling about Ken Lewis' rather ambiguous remarks with regard to the BAC dividend.       Good luck to all,       Sarge K                      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          Msg : 1895 of 1936     9/18/2008 12:14:40 PM               Author:    SargeK               send pm      add member to favs      ignore      recommend             Strong Buy                                                       view thread ,   thread start         In response to  msg 1891  by  mtnstmab05                           Recs: 3         Second stage BAC booster kicks in      from the July 15th, $18.44 launching pad, BLAST OFF! The 52% PPS elevation from the launching pad to the $28 altitude seen today is traveling at mach speeds that a "dead cat" is incapable of bouncing. If there is such a cat, I'd like to own one.       Today may represent the last opportunity to lock in 9% yields on BAC.       The purchase price of $29 PPS for 1.53 billion MER shares was $44.37 billion when the deal was struck.    The fixed exchange rate of .8595 BAC share for one(1) MER share, according to Ken Lewis is "etched in stone". If my math is correct, It will require 1.315 billion BAC shares to purchase 1.53 billion MER shares; resulting in 5.875 BAC common shares outstanding when the deal closes.       Current, 2009 mean earning estimate for BAC is $3.23 per share  http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=BAC  and $2.55 for MER  http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=MER        Combined 2009 estimated earnings for the merged companies can be calculated to be $18.63.    Cost of maintaining the $2.56 BAC annual dividend multiplied by 5.875 billion shares is $15.04 billion.       The estimated earnings estimate does not include the amount that "Bank of America expects to achieve $7 billion in pre-tax expense savings efficiencies, fully realized by 2012." Nor does the estimate include the $10s of billions of tax-loss carryforwards that BAC is entitled to because of the Countrywide and Merril Lynch acquisitions.       The estimates also do NOT include a growing customer base (depositors &amp; investors) nor does it include the increased earnings BAC can reliabily expect to receive from the legislative bailout of mortgage lenders that becomes effective October 1, 2008       In summary, I think most of the bad news can now be seen in the rear-view mirror and the good news is straight ahead. FWIW       Good luck to all       SargeK       Note: If the SEC would just go ahead and ban all short sells , the equity markets would explode. I"ll not hold my breath waiting for that to happen.                                           thread start
