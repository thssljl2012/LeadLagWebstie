  It's not going to change until those institutions fail. We are spending money on a lost cause.   My view is that we are injecting money into the wrong part of the capital structure. Providing funding via "Perferred Equity" is simply extending a loan. Because Preferreds are higher in the capital structure, they drag on earnings (because of the coupon payments) and they freeze out private investment.    We need to bolster the Common (i.e. "at risk") Equity positions of the major banks. That requires either exposing the tax payer to a risky asset, taking a loss by buying toxic assets at above market prices, or outright nationalization.    Those institutions (Fannie, Freddie, Bank of America, Citi) cannot "fail". It would be Lehman Brothers X 10. The Fed already realizes that letting Lehman fail exasperated the deflationary spiral in asset prices. Letting Citi or Bank of America fail (i.e. liquidate) would be a one-way ticket to a deep depression.
