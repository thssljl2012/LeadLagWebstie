Even at the end, after presiding  over the worst performance in the 94-year history of Merrill Lynch, and  as Bank of America pinned the blame for a bonus payment scandal  squarely on his back, John Thain did not seem to know what was about to  befall him.       Last Wednesday, Mr Thain (pictured above) purchased 8,400 shares in  BofA, which had just rescued his company, and was finalising plans to  jet off to Davos, where he would hobnob with members of the global  business elite. But on Thursday morning, it was Ken Lewis, BofA chief  executive, who hopped on a jet for a short flight from Charlotte, North  Carolina, to New York, where he confronted Mr Thain in his corner  office and dismissed him.     Just like that, in a meeting that was  over in 15 minutes, the high-flying Wall Street career that Mr Thain  had spent three decades constructing came to a crashing end.     Named  chief executive of Merrill Lynch in November 2007, Mr Thain took over a  legendary investment bank that, in common with the rest of Wall Street,  had fallen on hard times since the credit crisis hit that August. His  mission was clear. Based on his record both at the rival Goldman Sachs,  where he had been president, and then as head of the New York Stock  Exchange, his nickname &#8220;Mr Fix-it&#8221; made it appear likely he would excel  at the job and perhaps earn a place in the pantheon of Wall Street  titans who had secured the future of great institutions.
