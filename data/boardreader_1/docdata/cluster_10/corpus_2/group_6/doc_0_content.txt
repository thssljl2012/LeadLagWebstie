                           Summary :                           FT reports Temasek has 40% of it's portfolio in Financials.                         Considering that financials has dropped up to 90% in certain cases,                         Temasek is probably sitting on massive losses that if disclosed to                         the general public would cause an outrage. Even on the "astute"                         Merrill's investment with anti-dilution clauses that compensates                         Temasek for losses in equity stake, Temasek is set to lose 2                         billion on the Merrill's trade out of 5 billion invested last year.                         The investments in financials probably equates to a 30% loss of the                         entire portfolio of Temasek, and considering that the other 60%                         portfolio of real estate, equities etc.. which would have lost                         30-40% on average (by conservative measures). Temasek probably lost                         50-60% of it's total portfolio in the last year. So much for                         boasting about high annual returns of 6% in the last two decades.                         All was lost in a single year and the managers of Temasek still                         kept patting their backs and raking in huge salaries for the last                         10 years.&amp;nbsp; It will probably take another 10-15 years of 6-8%                         annual growth for Temasek to recover the losses in the last year.                         You can probably have monkeys trading and they probably could                         better these well paid investment officers.                           The right thing for Temasek is to have some accountability and                         fire the high-paid executives who came up with this trade and                         assauge the public that failure is not acceptable in a                         government-linked organization which uses taxpayers money. World                         class sovereign fund?? I think not. Say goodbye to your CPF money,                         it's going to be locked up for a really really long time as the                         govt probably doesn't have enough to pay out everybody in the short                         term.                                                     Here's the article :-                                                                               Temaseks Merrill losses could exceed $2bn                           By Saskia Scholtes and Greg Farrell in New York                           Published: January 7 2009 23:13   Last updated: January 7 2009                         23:13                                                                                                         Temasek, the Singapore state investment fund, is sitting on                         significant paper losses related to its stake in   Merrill Lynch  , the investment bank acquired                         by   Bank of America   last week.                           The state agencys unrealised losses could amount to more than                         $2bn, excluding any hedges, according to a Financial Times analysis                         based on publicly available filings.                                                                                EDITORS CHOICE                                                                                The loss is emblematic of the damage the financial crisis has                         wrought on sovereign wealth fund investments in the banking sector                         and helps explain why funds have been reluctant to commit further                         capital to banks.                           Some 40 per cent of Temaseks portfolio is in the financial                         sector, and it has suffered paper losses on other investments,                         including   Barclays  ,   Bank of China   and   China Construction Bank  .                           Temasek on Monday disclosed it had converted its 13.7 per cent                         stake in Merrill into BofA shares following the acquisition.                           On December 31, the last day of trading before the deal closed,                         Temaseks remaining stake in Merrill, for which it paid an average                         of $23 a share, had dropped to $12.10.                           After ploughing $5bn into Merrill between December 2007 and                         February 2008, and with a further $900m commitment last summer,                         Temasek owns 189m BofA shares, according to Mondays disclosure. At                         Wednesdays opening price, they were worth $2.7bn.                           However, Temasek appears to have sold more than 30m shares of                         Merrill stock in the first and third quarters of 2008, according to                         regulatory filings. Even if Temasek sold at the lowest possible                         prices in these periods, the sales would have generated a modest                         profit to defray some of Temaseks unrealised loss.                           Temasek declined to comment.                           It could have been worse. Temaseks initial investment allowed                         it to buy more than 104m shares at $48 per share.                           But after Merrill was forced to raise further capital in July,                         the terms of Temaseks original investment were reset. This                         effectively bought Temasek 151m new shares in Merrill for just                         under $6 per share, bringing the average price paid per Merrill                         share to a little over $23.                           Temaseks investment suffered again in September, as Merrill                         shares plunged on concerns about the US banking sector.                           But any losses seemed to vanish when BofA agreed to buy Merrill                         in an all-stock deal which valued the latter at $29 a share. BofAs                         shares have since slumped, however.
