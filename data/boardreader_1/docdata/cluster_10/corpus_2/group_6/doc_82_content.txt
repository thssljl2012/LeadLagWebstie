I guess I do have one thing to say about "Mugging Bank of America."  Maybe you don't research, invest or trade individual stocks and don't have much interest in the fate of Bank of America (BOA).  If your 401K is invested in mutual funds that are diversified across all business sectors (i.e. don't exclude financial companies), then you may well be invested in BOA.  It has been one of the best stock performers in the financial sector over the past few years and thus has become a choice of many very good mutual fund managers (remember BOA was smart enough to mostly stay away from the easy money in these now toxic assets).  If you're invested in an index fund that buys all stocks in a given stock index, BOA is in the two top indexes:  DOW 30 and S&amp;P 500.  So if you have such funds in your 401K, you have Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson to thank for the hit you're taking on BOA.
