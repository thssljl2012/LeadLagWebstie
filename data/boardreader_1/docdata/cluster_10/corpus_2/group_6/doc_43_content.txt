Good debate.    I just read about Merrill Lynch. Seems that their losses were huge, but were kind of covered up until Bank of America took them over.    All of this does nothing for confidence. If banks can cover up their losses like Merrill Lynch and Lehmans, then how can we believe a convenient set of figures from Barclays?    And with the economies of the world in freefall right now, just how is Barclays managing to make such good profits?
