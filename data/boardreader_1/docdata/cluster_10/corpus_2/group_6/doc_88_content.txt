*pedant hats on*       1/10th the size (can't be 10 times smaller),       *pedant hat off*      Nationalising only makes sense if something is done with it ie turn it into what McWilliams described as a "skip" for bad debt to be unloaded into from the likes of AIB, BOI, etc.       http://news.stv.tv/business/70278-ec...nglo-takeover/            Quote:                         Lenihan also said the government may examine the possibility of creating a "bad bank" to park toxic assets now held on lenders' balance sheets.      One Dublin-based analyst said Anglo Irish would be a perfect vehicle for such a plan, which has been mooted by the head of the Federal Reserve as a way of retooling the U.S. bank sector.      "When we have severe economic downturns a lot of losses for banks come from the commercial property side of things and Anglo, given that is its speciality, is actually probably a very good vehicle," said the analyst.
