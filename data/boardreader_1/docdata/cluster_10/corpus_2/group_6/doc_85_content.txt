          BAC didn't do due diligence and got tricked by Thain   I am not so sure this is the case.  As I understand and I guess none of us will ever know for sure as such things are discussed in the golden hall of secrets:  The US Treasury originally called a crisis meeting to discuss Lehman brothers.  On the table: who is going to buy Lehman?  To cut a long story short, BOA declined and said they were looking instead at Merrill.  At the time Merrill was looking like the next one to go down after Lehman so Treasury was OK with that.    Apparently according to latest emissions from CEO of BOA, he says BOA subsequently looked at Merrill carefully and concluded there were problems with its assets.  Upon return to US Treasury however, Hank Paulson's Pistol which he keeps in his pocket was now pointed at BOA with a clear message:  "You are going to buy Merrill".  FED and Teasury have been running a policy of good bank marries bad bank to keep the tax payer out of paying for the bad banks and some of these cannot be allowed to fail.  FED and Teasury have been calling the shots on who are the bad banks and who are the good banks and who buys who.  BOA was more or less forced into buying Merrill.  This acquisition was forced on them as conditional to various bailouts that BOA received from US governments.  It is more or less the same as the story between LLOY and HBOS.    One has to feel sorry at this stage for the likes of Jim Susan.  It is somewhat unfair.
