Monday&amp;#8217;s session began with some much needed (for the bulls, anyway) euphoric buying after China announced a $500 plus billion stimulus package. Commodities were soaring higher before the cash market opened, hoping the payments to citizens would be dispersed throughout the Chinese economy. But the US market started to drop shortly after opening. Perhaps investors were thinking something along these lines: Growth in China must really be slowing for the government to pass this stimulus. China&amp;#8217;s economy has never dealt with slowing growth. For the past few years, GDP in China has roared above the 10% mark. As the world economy slows, China will not be immune. Can the Chinese citizens and businesses and government come to terms with a slowing economy? We will soon see. We&amp;#8217;ve seen the blowups in the banks, and the market has since thrashed commodity names. Now we are seeing the insurance firms get taken down. A couple months of the blow up of AIG we are seeing other insurance companies starting to unwind. PRU, MET, HIG, these companies are now in serious trouble. But right now, all focus has shifted to the auto-making industry. GM and F are practically insolvent, requiring government bailouts. To prevent a depression like scenario, I think these two battered companies need bailouts. If not, unemployment will shoot through the roof, likely well above 10%. If that happens, this market will probably crash again. Watch the 850 level on the S&amp;amp;P 500 and 8,200 on the DOW. If these levels are breached, look out below.
