Bad news for the executives over at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CNBC is reporting that executives could see bonuses decline by 50% to 70% this year, due to quarterly losses.   Many of the top executives, including CEO Lloyd Blankfein (pictured), will be forgoing their bonuses all together, and with good reason.     Blankfein may decide to skip his bonus after co-presidents Gary Cohn and John Winkelried stated they would most likely not accept theirs. Last year Blankfein was awarded $68 million, while Winkelried and Cohn walked away with $56 million, CNBC reports.   This will be the first time since its IPO in 1999 that Goldman Sachs expected to report a quarterly loss. Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital, told Dow Jones that this quarter's losses will be tied to exposure in the equity market. The report also includes recent estimates of losses:Morgan Stanley analyst Patrick Pinschmidt forecast a loss of $ 1.09 a share for Goldman, the steepest decline projected by an analyst. Also recently, UBS analyst Glenn Schorr changed Goldman's estimates to a loss of 40 cents from a gain of $1.40. Analyst Guy Moszkowski at Merrill Lynch expects Goldman to post a fourth-quarter loss of 49 cents a share.The losses are already translating into layoffs. Goldman Sachs reportedly doled out pink slips to 3,200 employees and plans to slash 10% of its work force. - Maria Woehr
