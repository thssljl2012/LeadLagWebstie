Even the stock market gurus like Warren Buffett are suffering Black 2008.   Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) is down 25.8% from a year ago and 28.4% year to date. It fell 8% last week, bringing its losses for the last month to 14.4%. Over the last three years, it has gained an average of 4.5% and its expected three year total returns are expected by Morningstar.com to average 23.3% annually. BRK.B closed Friday at $3,389, or at 71% of its estimated fair value of $4,800 per share.   Last week, Berkshire reported that it has purchased Eaton (ETN) and additional shares of ConocoPhillips (COP) and NRG Energy (NRG). It reduced its holdings in Bank of America (BAC) and Lowes (LOW). A few weeks ago Buffett announced that he was buying stock, and the speculation was that he was buying more Wells Fargo (WFC). So far, apparently not.    Daily charts for BRK.A, BRK.A and the stocks mentioned above are here.   The 40 stocks in Berkshires portfolio are down an average of 31.4% and 30.6% year to date, compared with the Dow Jones Industrials, which are down about 40% year-to-date. In the last week, the stocks were down an average of 6.5% and in the last month they were down an average of 10.2%. Berkshire hasnt owned all of the stocks during the periods under review. The returns arent weighted and dont reflect Berkshires actual gains and losses.   I dont own any of these stocks.   For educational purposes only. Investigate before you speculate. I am not recommending any trades and take no responsibility for how others trade.
