Will Apple step up and offer a better deal during the Black Friday sale? Well, for consumers sake let&amp;#8217;s hope so.  Black Friday is one of the biggest sales in the United States. Traditionally retailers offer big discounts on items during his day. People line up very early for the chance to shop for big discounts. Apple has been traditionally conservative during this day. Offering discounts but nothing spectacular. According to the AppleInsider report, Barclays Capital expects Apple to be more aggressive in its sale. Will this come true? I&amp;#8217;m hoping it does but I&amp;#8217;m not holding my breath. Apple distinguishes itself by being a premium brand and I think dragging down the price too much will go against their strategy. Sure times are tough but Apple is still enjoying good sales and I think people are really willing to pay value for money. However I don&amp;#8217;t mind being wrong. Not when Apple stuff on the cheap will be available. Let&amp;#8217;s wait and see. Tags: apple, Black Friday, Discount, SaleShare This
