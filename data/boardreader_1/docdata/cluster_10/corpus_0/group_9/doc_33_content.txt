The Federal Reserve today said it signed an agreement with First Regional Bancorp, limiting its ability to distribute or borrow money. The Century City-based bank must get prior approval from the San Francisco Fed office before paying dividends or taking on new debt, among other things. The Fed said it took action to &#8220;maintain the financial soundness&#8221; of the bank. It gave no further explanation. The bank, which caters to small and mid-size businesses, had nearly $2.5 billion in assets at the end of last year, according to an FDIC filing. As of June, it had nearly $87 million in deposits at an Irvine regional branch. The company&#8217;s Web site also lists a loan production facility in Anaheim. Company officials were not immediately reachable for comment.
