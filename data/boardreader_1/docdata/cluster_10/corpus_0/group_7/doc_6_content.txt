While glutting our taxpayer dollars, Bank of America dished out cash for 850,000 square feet of interactive entertainment space where they featured items with their logo and solicited consumers to sign up for banking products. According to the Wall Street Journal, Bank of America claims that being the &#8220;Official Bank of the NFL&#8221; helps generate revenue and is part of the company&#8217;s &#8220;growth strategy.&#8221; I&#8217;ve stated in the previous blog post titled Jody&#8217;s Plan for Wall Street that I thought these CEO&#8217;s should be fired, in that post I listed my reasons. Seems Washington based consumer group Public Citizen agrees as part of a new movement called &#8220;Operation Accountability,&#8221; Public Citizen in asking American consumers to send Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis a pink slip.
