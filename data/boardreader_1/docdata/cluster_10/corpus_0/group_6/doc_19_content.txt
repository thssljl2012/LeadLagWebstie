 Citigroup&amp;#8217;s time at the top of the heap among major U.S. banks ended several months ago amid its run of multi-billion-dollar write-downs and eventual government bailout, but this week served as the final stamp to that end. In the late 1990s, then-CEO Sanford Weill basically engineered the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act with his decision to buy Travelers Insurance and unite it with Citibank. This week, Citigroup was at the forefront of another legislative decision, a deal with Senate Democrats that will likely make passage of mortgage cramdown legislation &amp;#8212; and with it, a reduction in principle for tons of homeowners &amp;#8212; much easier. The week also saw the departure of chief cook and bottle washer Robert Rubin after a 10-year tenure in which the stock revisited prices long thought to have been left behind, and the report that the firm is considering getting rid of its Smith Barney brokerage &amp;#8212; one of the key pieces of the financial-supermarket strategy envisioned by Mr. Weill. It could, in a way, serve as a microcosm for the denouement of the rule of Wall Street and the dawn of a more regulated financial-services industry, particularly as the nation&amp;#8217;s major institutions are partially owned by the government. &amp;#8220;The pendulum is swinging back to trying to protect the global economy from Wall Street run amok,&amp;#8221; says Peter Cohan, who runs a management consulting firm. &amp;#8220;Rubin&amp;#8217;s retirement is sort of a punctuation mark for the end of the era of deregulation.&amp;#8221; Much like former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, the impressions of Mr. Rubin have been altered by the last decade, and his move from the Treasury Secretary&amp;#8217;s office to his thorny period at Citigroup. &amp;#8220;Robert Rubin has pretty much exhausted his ability to defend his reputation,&amp;#8221; Mr. Cohan says.  Sentiment only matters to a point. The market may have been delighted that the Labor Department&amp;#8217;s report on December employment did not tell of a million jobs lost during the month, or burst into flames upon printing, but that&amp;#8217;s of little comfort when payrolls fell by 524,000, the unemployment rate rose to 7.2%, and the hourly workweek declined. The market allowed itself a dose of optimism in the last couple of weeks, believing that somehow, the economic malaise would prove fleeting, and investors could ready themselves for a second-half recovery. This week&amp;#8217;s profit warnings from the likes of Intel, Chevron, Time-Warner and others gave lie to that assumption, and the markets felt it this week, with the Dow losing ground for three consecutive sessions. &amp;#8220;If people think recovery means getting back to the way things were six months, a year, or 18 months ago, that&amp;#8217;s not going to happen,&amp;#8221; says Dan Deighan, founder of Deighan Financial Advisors in Melbourne, Fla., who says &amp;#8216;recovery&amp;#8217; is better defined by improvement in bad jobs figures and foreclosures, not a rebound. A number of prominent names led the losers today, including luxury goods maker Coach, which fell 13.4%, and AK Steel Holdings, which declined by 15% after the steelmaker said Thursday it will start shedding some of its 1,500 salaried employees.   When energy companies are beginning to show the strains of an extended economic downturn, one can be reasonably sure that the market is going to continue to struggle for some time. The prevailing view amid this mini-rally of the last several weeks has been that the harsh times would not linger, but a decision by oil-services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger to cut workers points to a longer deterioration. Couple that with an earnings warning from Chevron Corp., and it suggests these companies are girding for an extended period of slack demand for energy products. &amp;#8220;With oil prices cut in half and a fall in operating expenses likely lagging prices, we expect earnings per barrel to fall by two-thirds,&amp;#8221; write analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase, in a commentary on Chevron. &amp;#8220;We also look for volumes to fall a bit short of prior guidance.&amp;#8221; Oil continued to sink, losing nearly 12% this week to close at $40.83, dashing the hopes of those who confidently predicted oil would reclaim the $50 mark in due course. Shares of Halliburton fell 10.2% and Schlumberger was off by 6.2%, while Chevron lost 1.9%. &amp;#8220;Now that they&amp;#8217;re shedding parts of their employees you&amp;#8217;re just going to see a trickle effect down the line with various sectors,&amp;#8221; says Joe Arnold, investment advisor at Dawson Wealth Management in Cleveland.     Lennar shares were hit by rumors, but did not recover.  It was a crazy day for the homebuilders, particularly Lennar Corp., which was jolted by accusations of fraud coming from investor Barry Minkow (himself convicted), who runs a site called the Fraud Discovery Institute. Basically, the brouhaha caused investors to run to the options market for the purpose of plunking down massive bets on Lennar stock continuing to get tagged over the next week. More than 64,000 put contracts traded Friday, most at the $10 strike price, which began the day as an unprofitable bet and finished as a profitable one &amp;#8212; provided shares remain below $10 when options expire at the end of next week. The stock closed the day at $9.15 a share, down nearly 20%, hitting a low of $8.23 shortly after Mr. Minkow alleged that Lennar used equity of a joint venture as collateral for debt of other ventures, something CEO Stuart Miller denied in an interview with CNBC. But the frenzied reaction shows that traders can be moved to dramatic ends with ease, particularly on a fractured group such as the builders, which have been underperforming for more than a year-and-a-half. &amp;#8220;Everybody has jumped in and traded this thing,&amp;#8221; says Jon Najarian, co-founder of Optionmonster.com. He notes that unusual put activity started to appear in the last couple days on Lennar and several other homebuilders. Competitors were also hit, including Pulte Homes Inc., down 4.9%, and KB Home, down 2.8%.
