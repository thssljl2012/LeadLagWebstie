This morning Bank of America will go sit in the corner and be introduced to its new friends.   "Hi we're Freddie and Fannie! Come on in, its not so bad!"  "The name is AIG. I run things around here so stay the F**k out of my way and don't even think about putting your crap up there. I got the top bunk!"  "Hello, I am Citigroup. I really don't belong here. My lawyers are cooking up a new defense as we speak. Don't disturb Bear Stearns over there. He's been here a long time and he doesn't say too much."  Here are the detail for the Bank of America bailout. First, Bank of America posted a $1.79 billion loss for the fourth quarter. This DID NOT INCLUDE a FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR LOSS FROM MERRILL! Did Merrill have this crap stored away on a super-tanker docked just off-shore?!  The government is giving BofA $20 billion in new capital. The investment will be preferred stock carrying a 8% coupon. Additionally, Treasury and FDIC are guaranteeing a $118 billion pool of assets with BofA taking the full loss on the first $10 billion and then 10% on the remaining $108 billion. Just like Citi, Treasury and FDIC have their own attachment points (when one stops taking losses and the other starts). The Fed will provide financing to Treasury and FDIC in the event the assets become "ours". We get another $4 billion of preferred shares for the guarantee.  Well, thats that. Time for breakfast.
