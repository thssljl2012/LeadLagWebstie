Silver is currently 11.05.The mining stocks are responding by moving higher today. We are looking at another three day week end, so the second team will be manning the trading desks this afternoon and trading is likely to be very light. My trading stocks are all up again today, as follows: DROOY 5.46; HMY 10.04 (I am glad that I bought below 10), and VGZ 1.45.

As always, please, make your own decisions, commit them to the Lord and give Him praise for the results. Buyer beware and very cautious is the watch word for these days. From Mine Web:Precious metals likely to outperform for commodity investors.     Global financial and economic meltdown has hammered commodities, but investors still see rich pickings in agricultural staples.         Author: Pratima Desai  Posted:  Friday , 16 Jan 2009       LONDON (Reuters)  -      Global financial and economic meltdown has hammered commodities, but investors still see rich pickings in agricultural staples such as grains and rice -- essentials the world cannot do without. The strong outlook for the agricultural sector this year is likely to be closely followed by prospects for oil where output cuts by OPEC countries are expected to accelerate over the next few months, leaving the market short.

The US jewellery industry has been hard hit.         Author: Rhona O'Connell  Posted:  Friday , 16 Jan 2009       LONDON -      The second interim update for the GFMS Ltd annual gold survey highlights gold's highly individual nature, arguing that while recessionary conditions undermine the outlook for physical fabrication of the metal this year, the prospects for investment demand are robust and that an investor-led breach of the March 2008 high of $1,023.50 is quite feasible during the first half of this year.

Author: Lawrence Williams  Posted:  Thursday , 15 Jan 2009       LONDON -      Gold analysis and theorising is a hazardous exercise with the metal price seldom seeming to follow what would appear to many to be the logical path to new heights - and on the occasions it does surge dramatically, it then tends to come crashing down again, burning the fingers of many.  This is not to say that gold is not a good investment as has been shown by its overall performance against markets in general over the past year, and is not to say it will not regain its upward trajectory before too long, but some of the admittedly well thought out, and perhaps economically logical, theories put out by gold proponents, which would lead to a huge gold price increase, are still, in our view, unlikely to come about Notable amongst these theories are two, very logical moves either of which would increase the gold price dramatically, but will they in fact ever happen?
