I hate to belabor this point BUTAs of mid-December Paulson was expecting no other major financial institution to failSo, what about todays $138 billion bailout of Bank of America?Wasnt this one just too obvious?Countrywide Financial was a complete sham and Merrill Lynch was a disaster waiting to happen Kenneth Lewis must resign in disgrace no?Now the Obama Administration is looking to revive the Paulsons old Bad Bank concept  Will the government ever learn from its mistakes?
