Hasan points to this: Remember just over one year ago? RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland) paid $100bn for ABN Amro. For this amount it could now buy: Citibank $22.5bn Morgan Stanley $10.5bn Goldman Sachs $21bn Merrill Lynch $12.3bn Deutsche Bank $13bn Barclays $12.7bn And still have $8bn in change with which you would be able to pick up: GM, Ford, Chrysler and the Honda Formula 1 Racing-Team....
