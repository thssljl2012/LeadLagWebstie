         One reliable indicator of a stock's bullish potential is when insiders make large purchases of the stock with their own money.  Insiders are insiders, after all, and should know the prospects of a company's future better than anyone else.If so, then Bank of America is better off than we might think.Bank of America Corp., the biggest U.S. lender by assets, gained 31 percent in New York trading after Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lewis and five directors bought more than 500,000 shares for at least $3 million.Lewis bought 200,000 shares of the bank at prices ranging from $5.98 to $6.06 yesterday, while director Robert Tillman also bought 200,000 shares for $5.77 to $5.78, according to a filing today. Temple Sloan Jr., lead director of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, bought 41,800 shares. Buyers also included William Barnet III, Jacquelyn Ward and John Collins. Nothing's a sure thing, of course, and BOA could still go in the tank.  But a few insiders are betting a few million that it won't.If anyone is interested in using insider buys as an investing or trading strategy, then here is a good place to go to keep track of Form 4 transactions.
