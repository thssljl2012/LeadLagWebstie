     We have a new member of my CLT Club, (Cheaters, Liars and Thieves), and it is now ex-CEO of Merrill Lynch, John Thain.When he joined Merrill to help it out of its major financial mess, he was praised for being a very smart guy who many felt including Merrill's top executives and brokers could guide the investment bank out of its abyss.He was fired this week because he wasn't so smart after all. His sense of "entitlement" despite the billions in losses at Merrill under his watch led to a $1.2 Million office renovation including an $88,000 toilet. It also included handing out BILLIONS in bonuses to his top brass despite the fact that the entity was bleeding to death just before it was bought by Bank of America.One of the biggest problems in this country right now is GREED especially among the top executives of the investment banking world. Different than traditional bankers, these CLTs have long thought they were so self-important that lavish living was part of the reward for ascending the investment banking ladder and the company's performance was irrelevant. In the case of Thain, I believe he should have to pay back the cost of his office re-do and his cronies who received billions in bonuses should have to return this money as well. NO ONE should be paid a bonus if their work leads to billions of dollars in losses affecting millions of people. So welcome Mr. John Thain to that increasingly less elite club called CLT. Watching out for you everyday.Eli
