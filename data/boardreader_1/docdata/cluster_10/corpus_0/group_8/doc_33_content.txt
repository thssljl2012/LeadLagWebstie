The CtW Investment Group sent the following letter today to Bank of Amerillwide Lead Director O. Temple Sloan, re: getting rid of Ken Lewis. For the KL fans in the group, do not fear.  As previously stated, the CEO has no plans to leave, ever.   March 5, 2009  O. Temple Sloan  Lead Director  Bank of America   100 N. Tryon Street   Charlotte, North Carolina 28255  Dear Mr. Sloan:   Recent events have fatally undermined investor confidence in Bank of America (BAC) Chairman and CEO Kenneth D. Lewis.  With BAC's share price now down 90% in 5 months, we call upon the BAC board of directors to immediately seek the resignation of Chairman and CEO Ken Lewis. Absent prompt action to remove Mr. Lewis, we will have no choice but to call upon BAC shareholders to join us at BAC's upcoming annual meeting in voting against Mr. Lewis, Thomas Ryan, as chair of the Corporate Governance Committee responsible for CEO succession, and you as lead independent director.
