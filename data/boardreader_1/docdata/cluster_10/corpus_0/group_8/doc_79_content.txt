 FDIC warns US bank deposit insurance fund could tank I never thought much of FDIC insurance. Currently, many banks are tanking and this is what the FDIC calls its  funds:  A week ago the FDIC reported a sharp depletion of the deposit insurance fund in the fourth quarter due to actual and anticipated bank failures, to 19 billion dollars from 34.6 billion in the third quarter. The FDIC said it had set aside an additional 22 billion dollars for estimated losses on failures anticipated in 2009. $34.6 billion dollars is just 21.61% of the total bill for the Savings and loan crisis, which came out to $160.1 billion with the government paying $124.6 billion directly to solve the problem. Basically, what the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila Bair, is saying is that at the rate we are going, $5.2 billion dollars a month according to what was spent in 2008 4Q ($15.6 billion), we could be looking at $62.4 billion more in 2009. The agency currently has $19 billion; it is adding $22 billion; hence, it will be left with a $21.4 deficit for 2009, provided that bank failures continue at a steady pace. In the meantime, shes proposing raising the insurance fees, which, of course, will be passed on to the rest of us.  The head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila Bair, in a letter to bank chief executives dated March 2, defended the FDIC's plan to raise fees on banks and assess an emergency fee to shore up the fund and maintain investor confidence. Bair acknowledged the new fees, announced Friday, would put additional pressure on banks at time of financial crisis and a deepening recession, but insisted they were critical to keep the insurance fund solvent and protect. Of course, the banks that turned over the apple cart could care less what the FDIC does. It is the guppies in the fish tank that have to pay the price.
