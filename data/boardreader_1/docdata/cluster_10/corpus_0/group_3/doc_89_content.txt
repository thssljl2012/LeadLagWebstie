     According to Bloombergs, the Lucky Nine have been identified by the Fed for the bailout.&amp;#0160; They are:CitigroupGoldman SachsWells FargoJP Morgan ChaseBank of AmericaMerill LynchState StreetBank of New York MellonThey will share 125 million of compulsory investment between them.&amp;#0160; The other 125 billion will go to the other &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; players in the market.&amp;#0160; So, looks Okay, no?&amp;#0160; If you want to guarantee that the small regional banks are going to get it in the shorts, sure.&amp;#0160; Who would stick with the regionals once the big guys get the dough and the implicit guarantees?In the UK, it's not such a big deal precisely because there are no regional banks to speak of.&amp;#0160; In the USA that is not the case.&amp;#0160; Also a lot of the small regional banks are about to be totally hosed by over-exposure to commercial real estate developments.What Paulson, ex-Goldman's himself, seems to be aiming for is a rapid consolidation of large healthy banks, and making it pretty clear that smaller actors are ones that are going to go down.&amp;#0160; Maybe doesn't mean this to be the outcome, but that's what he is doing here.&amp;#0160; He is also on record as saying that other institions will fail, even with the bailout.&amp;#0160; Funnily enough it wouldn't be aimed at anyone he has eat dinner with.&amp;#0160;
