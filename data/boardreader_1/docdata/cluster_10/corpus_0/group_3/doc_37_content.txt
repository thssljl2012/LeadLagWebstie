News of the passage of the $700 billion government financial rescue package was not enough to scare the bears away on Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial average capped of a tumultuous week with a 157.47 point drop to close at 10,325.38 on Friday, due in part to the jobs report that employers cut 159,000 jobs in September, the ninth straight monthly decline. The battered financial sector also continued to take a beating, partly on fears that the bailout may not help to thaw out credit markets.Citigroup Inc. was hit particularly hard Friday, declining 18.44% to close at $18.35 per share as its plans to acquire Wachovia Corp. were trumped by Wells Fargo &amp; Co., which agreed to buy the bank for $15.1 billion. Citi blasted the Wells Fargo-Wachovia deal, saying it constitutes breach of contract as Citi had an exclusivity agreement with the target. Wells Fargo took a slight hit on the news that it is taking on the troubled bank, as its stock fell 1.71% to close at $34.56. Wachovia reaped the benefits of the news, soaring 58.82% to close at $6.21 per share.  American Insurance Group Inc. shareholders did not seem thrilled with asset sales that new chairman and CEO Edward Liddy discussed Friday, as the stock slipped 3.75% to close at $3.85 per share. AIG, as expected, will seek to retain its core U.S. property and casualty business and its foreign general insurance business, and sell all other assets. Some analysts, however, believe these sales may not be enough to cover its $85 billion Federal Reserve loan. - Michael Rudnick                 Troubled Wall Street        Prices at 4:00 pm EDT                 Name       Price at          open       Price          at 4:00pm       Change       Mkt cap                 J.P.
