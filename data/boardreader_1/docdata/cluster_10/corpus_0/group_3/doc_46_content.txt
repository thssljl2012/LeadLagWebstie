            With financial   institutions falling prey one after another to the global credit crisis, the   bailout packages announced by various governments across the globe are   inching towards two trillion-dollar mark -- an amount nearly double the size   of Indian economy.   With the US   Congress giving nod to $ 700-billion aid for troubled financial institutions   in the country, the US   government alone has announced a total package worth about $990 billion.   Besides, a   handful of European countries have already announced packages worth a similar   amount in efforts to save their troubled financial entities.   There are   expectations for more such instances of helping hands coming from the   governments in Europe as the crisis is said to be fast spreading in the   region after a full-blown blast in the US.   However, nothing   of this sort is expected in India   as the country and its financial institutions have remained mostly insulated   from any direct impact of the crisis.   Still, the   collective bailout packages in the US   and Europe, currently at about $1.8   trillion, could soon be double the size of one trillion-dollar Indian   economy.   India's GDP is estimated at Rs   46,93,602 crore for the latest fiscal 2007-08, which stands at just over $one   trillion based on the current exchange rate of about Rs 46.8 to a dollar.   From   America to Europe, the deepening financial turmoil has seen the   fall of big names, especially in the banking industry, such as the bankruptcy   of Lehman Brothers, firesale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and the   extension of $ 85 billion lifeline to AIG.
