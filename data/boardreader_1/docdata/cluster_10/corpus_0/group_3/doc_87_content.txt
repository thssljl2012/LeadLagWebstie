News feed from the NYPost reveals a probe into the former investment bank - [ whose IB stuff you may recall went to Barclays ] - This clip has Harvey Miller(bankruptcy pro) at Weil Gotschal Manges(as previously tipped) acting for Lehman set out the way things are..Miller said Lehman is emerging from the "chaos" that characterized its bankruptcy protection filing and the weeks following it. But the biggest obstacle remains unwinding over 1.5 million derivatives contracts, including credit default swap agreements that Lehman had involving over 8,000 counterparties. (my emphases)I hear how that volume of outstanding scrutiny will likely lift the manpower doing the work from 150 to 400 or so.Zac Kouwe also reports  Miller disputed claims made by hedge funds including Harbinger Capital Partners that Lehman shifted cash among some of its subsidiaries before filing for bankruptcy. The funds, who say they are owed more than $250 million, want access to internal documents and want to depose CFO Ian Lowitt in connection with the supposed transfers.Zin
