I am traveling with an old friend, Bruce Bradley.  Bruce got his start in politics as the advance man for Bill Miller, Barry Goldwater&amp;#8217;s Vice Presidential candidate in 1964.  Bruce supervised Henry Kissinger during Nelson Rockefeller&amp;#8217;s run in 1968.  He also is an old friend of Gary Hart&amp;#8217;s, who lived with Bruce during his first term in Washington.  Bruce ran a Wall Street firm in the 70s, so he is an old hand at this business.  I asked him to offer his thoughts on the latest &amp;#8220;crisis.&amp;#8221;  Here you go: By Bruce Bradley It is a curious irony that the new, fragmented oversight regulators look a lot like the old. If, and when, Congress passes a bailout package that the President supports, the same regulators, the Fed, Treasury, Comptroller of the Currency, HUD, FDIC and others will be in charge of monitoring, shoring up, and regulating the financial institutions and insurance giants. These are the same leaders who failed to regulate going into the current crisis. If we had been told this time last year that Bear Stearns, Lehman, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Wachovia, and AIG would no longer exist in their present form or at all, we would have thought the world had come to an end. Where was the SEC when it came to monitoring net capital requirements for some of the world leading investment houses?  Where were the insurance regulators when AIGs $450 billion in the credit-default swaps market, which support investment funds and world banks, when they should have been raising red flags? What were the Congressional oversight and regulating committees doing as the brand names of finance, banking, and insurance were sliding into the abyss? These giant failures reside in highly regulated sectors.   (more&amp;#8230;)
