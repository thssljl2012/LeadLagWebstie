I've already posted two times aggregated sum of writedowns caused by subprime meltdown. It is time to see updated version of losses for major financial institutions. This time I've added column with amount of raised capital and money infusions to respective institution.Altogether financial losses account for USD 592 bln. Up to now raised capital and money infusion are USD 443 bln. You can see that since last time total sum has been almost tripled.              ticker   losses   capital received                       Citigroup   (C)   61   71       Wachovia   (WB)   52.7   11       Merrill Lynch   (MER)   52.2   29.9       Washington Mutual   (WM)   45.6   12.1       UBS   (UBS)   44.2   27.3       HSBC   (HBC)   27.4   5.1       Bank of America   (BAC)   27.4   30.7       JPMorgan Chase   (JPM)   18.8   19.7       Morgan Stanley   (MS)   15.7   14.6       IKB Deutsche Industriebank   (IKBDF)   4.1   11.6       Lehman Brothers   (LEHMQ)   13.8   13.9       Royal Bank of Scotland   (RBS)   13.6   22.2       Credit   Suisse    (CS)   10.1   3       Wells Fargo   (WFC)   10   5.8       Deutsche Bank   (DB)   9.9   6                       TOTAL      592.9   443   *losses includes subprime and mortgage writedowns, reserves for bad mortgages and loans, credit losses.*capital received includes preferred shares, bonds, convertible bonds, direct stakes.http://stockweb.blogspot.com/atom.xml
