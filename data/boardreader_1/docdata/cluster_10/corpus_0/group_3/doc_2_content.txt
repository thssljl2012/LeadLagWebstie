The question is, of course, now what? First, whats happening in the bond market.Treasury bonds, which were down around  point all day are now flat. I am very surprised, as it seems like the most obvious impact of the TARP is that Treasury issuance will rise significantly. I do not like the Treasury market here at all. I am also surprised the dollar remained stronger. For what its worth, I'm not shocked the stock market sold off.Credit spreads, at least in CDS, were mixed. Goldman, GE Capital, American Express, all about 40bps tighter. Interestingly Merrill Lynch is about 30bps tighter while Bank of America is unchanged, indicating an increasing odds on the merger being completed. Currently BofA is around +165 and Merrill is around +400, so there is plenty of room there. The CDX was 2bps wider.Citi and Wells Fargo both a little wider. I would bet on Citigroup prevailing in the Wachovia thing. Citigroup has apparently been the only thing standing between here and a run on Wachovia since Monday. I think the FDIC wants to reward banks who are first responders on failed banks. Allowing Wells Fargo to step in now would create a bad precedent. The FDIC does not want to see other banks hesitate to step in to buy deposits in future bank failures.Swap spreads were also tighter. 2-year swaps were 13bps tighter, while 10-year swaps were 5 tighter. I do not know exactly what to make of it, but the 13bps move in 2-year swaps is consistent with recent volatility, but the 10-year is an outsized move.Agency spreads moved in context of swaps. MBS spreads were unchanged after being significantly tighter through most of the day. Still like MBS and agencies over corporates here.Fed funds futures have now priced 100% chance of either a 50bps or 75bps cut at the October meeting. I think other liquidity measures, like extending liquidity to ABCP or some such, would be more effective. But Im not going to fight the Fed if they want to cut. The play is to bet on the curve steepening and dollar weakening.I am remaining defensive in credit. I would say I am closer to buying finance paper than industrial paper, though not buying either at the moment. The bailout and all the Feds liquidity measures are much more likely to help large financials to survive, but nothing is going to stop the coming recession. But I need to see some better trading volume before even considering any corporate bond trade here.  ...
