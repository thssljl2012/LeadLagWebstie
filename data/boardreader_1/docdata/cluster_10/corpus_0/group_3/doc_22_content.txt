  Q.1:    What does Warren Buffett refer to as &amp;#8220;Weapons of Mass Destruction&amp;#8221; ?   Ans:    Credit Default Swaps (CDS ). A specific kind of counterparty agreement/ derivativewhich allows the transfer of third party credit risk from one party to the other. One party in the swap is a lender and faces credit risk from a third party, and the counterparty in the credit default swap agrees to insure this risk in exchange of regular periodic payments (essentially an insurance premium ). If the third party defaults , the party providing insurance will have to purchase from the insured party the defaulted asset . In turn, the insurer pays the insured the remaining interest on the debt , as well as the principal.  Buffets prophecy has come true with AIG the insurance company getting virtually destroyed because of CDS. Buffett&amp;#8217;s own insurance companiesavoided CDS.   Q.2:    What are &amp;#8220;Toxic Debts&amp;#8221; and why they are called so?   Ans:    Toxic debts are poor grade Mortgage Backed Securities or Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) in the books of banks. These are poor because the underlying mortgages have become bad because of defaults by the sub-prime borrowers. These are toxic because their values have to be written down and thereby banks have to incur huge losses.   Q.3:   Why is the US$ 700 Billion bailout being referred as &amp;#8220;Privatization of profits and socialization of losses.&amp;#8221;?   Ans:   The financial services companies, investment banks and commercial banks have all made huge profits in the last few years and distributed the same to their shareholders and executives. Now, when they are facing bankruptcy the government is bailing them out by giving them tax-payers&amp;#8217; money.   Q. 4:    The US economy is now said to be in the process of &amp;#8220;Deleveraging &amp;#8220;. What does &amp;#8220;Deleveraging&amp;#8221; mean?   Ans:    A process undertaken by a company in an attempt to reduce its financial leverage. Financial leverage can be beneficial for a company, but if it becomes too risky or harmful, the company may need to deleverage itself by decreasing the amount of debt that it has (by paying it off).Deleveraging is also called degearing.    By the way, General Electric has announced its plan to deleverage by issuing US $ 15 billion worth of equity, out of which 3 Billion worth of equity will be subscribed by Warren Buffett.   Q.5:   Severalcritics of the bailout plan are concerned about &amp;#8220;Moral hazards&amp;#8221; in such a package. What are the moral hazards in bailout?   Ans:    The risk that the presence of a contract will affect on the behavior of one or more parties. The classic example is in the insurance industry, where coverageagainst a loss might increase the risk-taking behavior of the insured.   If the banks and finance companies, know that there is the government waiting to protect them with a bailout package, in case things go wrong, they may be tempted to take more risk.    - G. Mohan
