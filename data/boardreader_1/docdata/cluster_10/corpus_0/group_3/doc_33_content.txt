The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. threw its support behind Citigroup Inc. in the unfolding drama over Wachovia Corp., which shocked markets by walking away from its deal with Citi and agreeing to a $15 billion offer from Wells Fargo &amp; Co.Friday afternoon FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said that the agency "stands behind its previously announced agreement with Citigroup." That deal announced on Monday would allow Citi to buy Wachovia's banking assets at the rock-bottom price of $2.1 billion, with the FDIC absorbing losses from write-downs that exceed $42 billion. Additionally, the deal would make Citigroup again the largest bank in the U.S., ceding that mantle back from Bank of America Inc. However, Wells Fargo swooped in Friday with a $15.1 billion offer that required no federal assistance, and also would have the effect of pushing Citigroup further down in the rankings.  Caught in an awkward position, the FDIC qualified its support for the Citigroup deal saying that "the FDIC will be reviewing all proposals and working with the primary regulators of all three institutions to pursue a resolution that serves the public interest." Citigroup has already demanded that Wells Fargo and Wachovia immediately terminate their merger agreement, saying that the agreement signed on Monday prohibited negotiating with another party. But with a far higher offer on the table from another bidder with no government assistance, Citi's agreement is likely to become a political football. - George White See FDIC statementSee Citigroup statement See Dealscape post on Wells Fargo See Dealscape post on Citigroup deal
