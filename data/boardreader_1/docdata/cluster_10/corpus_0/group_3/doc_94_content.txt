Topic for Sunday, Oct. 26 (draft version) No matter we really care or not, the financial crisis is affecting societies. Firstly, Lehman Brothers have to file a petition for reorganization under chapter 11 in the US Bankruptcy Court, then it was acquired by Barclays capital. This marks the largest bankruptcy in history ($613 bil. debt). Merrill Lynch has been acquired by Bank of American. And there is the largest government bailout of private company in US history when AIG accept the terms of the Federal Reserve Banks rescue package. A series of events that are considered as American financial crisis. After that, stock markets around the world go down, in Asia, in Europe. Oil price drops substantially. Vietnam stock market is going down these days. People lose their confidence in the economy. People seem to suffer from prices increasing. People worry about the economys development. They want to take cash, deposit their money to the bank instead of investing. Meanwhile, enterprises find hard to cover the interest of 17-18% /year if they borrow loans from banks. That means lacking capital for their investment, for their operations. And it also means profit is low or even loss, the budget of salary shrink, the income of workers decrease.  What is happening? What are the relationship among them? What is influence to our country s economy? How could the crisis  affect us? What about the government?
