  As you can see from the max chart provided, Bank of America is near the lows of its trading channel. The chart does not show the 26% pummeling that BAC received today to put it at $23. If I had funds to invest, (which I don't because I cashed-out nearly a year ago to buy my first home) I would plunk some flow down to buy BAC. You can rest assured that the stock will likely fall to the high teens (simply due to the fact that my timing is usually off by 10-15%). I merely suggest that all of the "rational" investors (which are few and far between today) start nibbling at BAC on any further weakness. Please let me know what you think by commenting to this site. I will post comments that are helpful, but not insulting...
