There are some days I have nothing to write about and some days that I have a lot of stuff swirling around in my head. Today is one of those days where I have a bunch of ideas that I can&amp;#8217;t quite nail down. First and foremost, it&amp;#8217;s been about two weeks since Citigroup bought insurance from the government&amp;#8230; and I still can&amp;#8217;t figure it out.    Secondly, Warren Buffet and Berkshire has been taking a lot of heat lately for 2019 European put options that they wrote, and I can explain why that&amp;#8217;s ridiculous. Thirdly, I read an interesting article on oil and the transportation of oil, which could be a reason for our current supply &amp;#8216;glut&amp;#8217;.  On Citigroup, the first thing I have to mention is I own shares. I&amp;#8217;m trying to figure out what to do with them, but the one thing I will not do is recommend them. Anything I recommend (lately) goes down (just like everything else) and even though I espouse investing for the long term, it still hurts when your positions fall. To recap, Citigroup got &amp;#8220;bailed&amp;#8221; out two weeks ago when the government stepped in and insured (effectively) losses on $306 billion (not face value, but marked down value) of Citi&amp;#8217;s assets. Citi absorbs the first $29 billion in losses, and then 10% of any losses beyond that, while maintaining 100% of the upside (if any). In exchange for providing this insurance the government received $7 billion in preferred shares for no additional consideration, and added $20 billion more in preferreds plus they got about 200 million warrants at $10.61 per common share. This is obviously a good thing for Citi shareholders, most notably because they weren&amp;#8217;t obliterated by the deal.   The question that remains unanswered, is what the heck is that $306 billion? In perusing their 160+ page quarterly report, it seems that Citi has maximum exposure (meaning if all those entities drew down all commitments and then went bankrupt and no money was ever recovered) on the VIEs of about $130 billion. Credit Suisse estimates that they have $98 billion in &amp;#8220;high risk&amp;#8221; assets in addition to that. Now we all know that Citi has mismanaged its risk horribly, but I have to make the assumption that a) they (Citi management)are not absolutely stupid b) the estimate of high risk assets is in the ballpark +/- $100 billion and c) they (Citi management) are not lying through their teeth in their reporting. If we make these leaps of faith then we have to assume that Citi chose its worst assets to be insured and didn&amp;#8217;t insure the 20%loan to valuemortgages, which would in turn mean we now know the maximum loss at Citi is materially less than it was two weeks ago (by tens of billions). The other important thing to note, is that barring a run on the bank, with the current Fed programmes in place, all of those assets (and all the assets on Citi&amp;#8217;s balance sheet) are fully funded. With the insurance in place, and therefore higher capital ratios, it is now possible to hold these securities to maturity&amp;#8230; which should materially reduce the associated loss on them. Citi no longer has to sell distressed assets at fire sale prices, not that they ever did, it just won&amp;#8217;t ever be a problem in a next-to-worst case scenario (unless of course there is a run on the bank, but it is important to note that EVERY bank in the world would be insolvent if there was a run on it). I would still like to know exactly what those $306 billion in assets are before I make an &amp;#8216;official&amp;#8217; call.  Warren Buffet wrote $40 billion in notional value of European puts that expire in 2019 (actually there were a bunch and I believe first expiry is 2019) for a premium of $4.5 billion. The market is now (or at least was) severely punishing him for that decision. There are several reason why it is actually very smart, but the most important thing to realize is why people write puts. You don&amp;#8217;t write puts for the sole purpose of profiting if the market goes up and your puts expire worthless (although that might be nice). One strategy involves writing puts that you KNOW will expire in the money, and therefore be assigned on. This means, effectively, that you are buying stock (or whatever) at a specific price. So let&amp;#8217;s pretend you wanted to buy $100 million worth of XYZ, at a price of $95, but the volume does not currently support it. By writing puts at $100 and receiving a $5 premium, you have effectively locked in a $95 purchase price (assuming the stock doesn&amp;#8217;t close above $100). Now I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting this was his plan, although it seems more than likely he thought about it. A commitment to buy the Dow at 13,000 in 11 years would mean, if he is assigned on it, that the stock market would be extremely cheap and he would, in effect, be executing a large purchase without impacting market prices. Another important point is that the market would only have to return 4% per year from these levels to be priced at 13,000 in 11 years, given the &amp;#8220;target&amp;#8221; inflation rate is 2% that would mean only 2% real performance, or exceptional underperformance for 11 years&amp;#8230; which once again would make the market &amp;#8220;cheap&amp;#8221;.  Finally, on oil, after some quick and dirty research I found out there are approximately 1.4 million barrels per day of petroleum products imported to the US from Saudi Arabia alone. It is also a 45 day journey for a VLCC (very large crude carrier) to go from Saudi Arabia to the US. Planes and cargo ships slowed downto conserve fuel (fuel consumption is an exponential function of speed, due to wind or water resistance) when oil prices were extremely high. I have not done research to verify that this was the particular case for Middle East oil coming to America, but if we assume it was and the average journey is 45 days. That means there are 45 tankers carrying 1.4 million barrels of oil each (63 million barrels in total) on the sea JUST for US imports from Saudi Arabia. If the tankers slowed down by 10% then they would need 49.5 days and 49.5 tankers to continue supplying the US with crude, but there would be a lag effect. Stockpiles would look to be 6.3 million barrels lower, because that crude would be in transport at sea. This might be misinterpreted as a sign that demand is higher than it actually is. Those 6.3 million barrels would remain &amp;#8220;at sea&amp;#8221; until the delivery speed increased back to 45 days. Now with oil prices lower, tanking companies are incented to drive faster (use more fuel, but pay fewer wages) so if the journey were reduced by 5 days (just to make things easier) it would appear as if we had 7 million more barrels of oil&amp;#8230; and it would appear like a huge supply glut appeared out of nowhere. This might then be taken as a sign that demand is much lower than it actually is. So far this is only a theory (in that I don&amp;#8217;t know if the VLCCs ever slowed down, nor if they are now speeding up) and it only applies to oil shipped from Saudi Arabia to the US (if you look at worldwide crude shipping the number would be way larger). What might be more concrete is the problems in the Suez Canal. If they do elect to &amp;#8220;go the long way&amp;#8221; to avoid Somali pirates, 20 days will be added to the journey. Again, just for Saudi Arabia to the US this will reduce inventories by about 38 million barrels.
