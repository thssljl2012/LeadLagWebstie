Two separate reports show that monthly layoffs are at their highest level in almost seven years.  CNBC reports that outplacement firm Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas  cites November job losses to be "181,671, up 61% from October and 148% higher than November 2007" while payroll company ADP says November job cuts were around 250,000.  (Back in January 2002, layoffs were at 248,475.)  And more are coming: In its takeover of Merrill Lynch, Bank of America may cut up to 30,000 jobs (they will cut at least 10,000), through layoffs, attrition, and sales of business units.  With that news, stock futures are down.
