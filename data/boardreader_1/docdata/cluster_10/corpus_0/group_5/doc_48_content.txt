Merrill Lynch, the king of Wall St. Brokers, lost about $10 billion last year and now Bank Of America is getting ready to buy it out.  Meanwhile, the bonuses continue to flow.  In the old days, the reason  was that you had to pay the talented or they will leave and go elsewhere.  Now, as we know, the talented have no talent and there is no place else to go.  Every Wall St. player is running away but, first, he secures his bonus. At Merrill Lynch, 100 people working in the bond division, collected over $1 million each to supplement their poor salaries - usually about $200,000.  Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs paid $20 million to each of about 50 executives for helping them go bankrupt.  Merrill&amp;#8217;s Dow Kim had a paltry salary of $350,000 so the company, full of shame for what they were doing to him, gave him a little bonus of $35 million.   For fun, Kim gave three of his deputies fortunes that allowed them immediately to purchase ocean front properties in New Jersey valued up to $5 million.   With hard times closing in, it is no time for softies so Kim left the company to try his luck elsewhere.   To show there were no hard feelings, Merrill, Lynch gave him $55 million in cold cash and $61 million in other goodies.     Yes, we are in a terrible financial crisis and nobody knows that better than the moguls who were the cause of it all.
