Hubby shared this e-mail a few weeks ago. With big companies cutting back on employments, perhaps we can all take these steps into consideration.       As forwarded by        a financial consultant, in Dubai.                                            Recession              is coming... make your own judgment, don't panic! Do what is              wise.The recession looks very eminent. It is really time to              take pro active steps to avoid a painful time in the next two years              which is how long the                             recession                            is expected to last.             Suggestions:1. Don't take any              loans; buy homes, properties with loans, or even cash. Keep as much              cash as possible.2. Pay off as much of personal loans,              private loans, as debt collection will be hastened.3. Sell              any stocks you can even at lower prices.4. Take money off              from Trust Funds.5.  Don't believe in huge sales              forecast from customers, be extremely prudent, lowest inventories,              reduce liabilities.6. Don't invest in new capital.7.              If you are selling homes/ properties/ cars, do it now, when you can              get good prices, they are going to fall.8.  Don't              invest in new business proposals.9. Cancel holiday plans              using credit cards.10. Don't change jobs, as companies will retrench              based on 'last in first out'.Stay cool, wait,              and if you took all of the above actions and more, you probably will              be better off then many. This is not a rumor.Bear Stearns is              the first of many banking and financial institutions that will start              falling in the not too future. If Bear Stearns can fall, so can JP              Morgan, Citibank, HSBC, and the whole world. US economy falls, the              rest will crumble.India and all those self economies will be              the most protected, but not gullible.Europe may be a little              stronger, but not China, another giant place!Malaysia will see              significant impact.Be alert and pass this to your              friends!!!
