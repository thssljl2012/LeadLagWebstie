Bloomberg is reporting that Bank of America&amp;#8217;s plan to sell $2.8 billion of shares in China Construction Bank that was pulled at the last minute on Dec. 15 was done so because of a securities law provision that would have required it to forfeit the profits on the sale. Chinas securities law bans investors holding more than 5% of a locally incorporated, publicly traded company from selling shares within six months of buying the stock. Not that such a law is on the statutes by happenstance, of course. Bank of America first invested in China Construction in 2005, taking a $3 billion pre-IPO stake. It put in another $1.9 billion last June, and a further $7 billion in November, by exercising an option that was part of its first deal in 2005. That took BofA&amp;#8217;s stake to 19.3% and gave it an estimated paper profit of $15 billion. BofA needs to raise cash to recapitalize its balance sheet. But China doesn&amp;#8217;t want strategic stakes in its banks traded like baseball cards, and it may have an eye on the end of the lock-ups next year for foreign investors in Bank of China and Industrial &amp;amp; Commercial Bank of China. Hence the law, which applies to shares of China-incorporated firms traded in Hong Kong as well as on the mainland exchanges. Nor is it afraid to use it. Martin Currie Investment Management, a Scottish money manager, had its local bank deposits frozen by a Chinese court in June after selling part of its 5.9% stake in Nanning Sugar Manufacturing just five months after acquiring it.
