I saw this recently on The Big Picture blog and thought it worthy of reproductionConsider that one year ago Royal Bank of Scotland paid US$100 billion for ABN Amro. That seemingly impossible amount would now buy:Citibank $22,5 billion (74% down)Morgan Stanley $10,5 billion (-72%)Goldman Sachs $21 billion (-67%)Merrill Lynch $12,3 billion (-77%)Deutsche Bank $13 billion (-71%)Barclays $12,7 billion (-71%)And still leave $8 billion change - with which you would be able to pick up General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and the Honda F1 team. Odd thing is, it would be hard/impossible to borrow the $100bn now to buy them.
