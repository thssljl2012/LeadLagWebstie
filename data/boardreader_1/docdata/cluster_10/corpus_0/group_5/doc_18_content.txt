How do some people sleep at night?John Thain, chairman and CEO of troubled Merrill Lynch, which has taken 10 billion dollars in federal aid, is seeking a $10 million-dollar bonus.  As John McEnroe would say, "You can't be serious."So I wonder how much he would want if he had actually made a profit for his company in the year he has been there?  As it is, they lost billions and they were purchased by Bank of America.  And for that he wants a bonus?This is lunacy.
