Wachovia Corp., which was recently acquired by Wells Fargo &amp; Co., has once again received the top ranking among U.S. banks in the American Customer Satisfaction Index.  The ACSI report, produced by the University of Michigan, calculates scores for banks every fourth quarter. It measures customer satisfaction with checking, savings and consumer loans.  On a 100-point scale, banks overall fell to a score of 75 from 78 in 2007 as they cut costs across services in order to offset large financial losses from the subprime mortgage crisis.  Although Wachovia led the banks for customer service in the last eight years, its score fell to 76 from 79 in 2007. The bank scored 79 in 2005 and 80 in 2006.  San Francisco-based Wells Fargo climbed to a score of 72 from 69 in 2007.  Charlotte-based Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) improved its score to 73 from 72 in 2007.  Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) came in last with a score of 69, the same number it had in 2007.  The overall ACSI score for a given quarter factors in scores from 200 companies in 44 industries and from local and federal government services.
