CHIEFS of the biggest US banks yesterday said they have not used government bailout money for executive compensation, dividends or lobbying and are taking cuts in pay.  The chief executives at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo were testifying before the House Financial Services Committee. The eight firms have so far received $166bn (114bn) of public funds. Congressional leaders pressured the executives to boost lending and help avert home foreclosures.  House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank asked the CEOs to impose a moratorium on foreclosures until new Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner establishes a programme to modify mortgages for troubled borrowers.  Citigroups chief executive Vikram Pandit yesterday pledged to take a salary of one dollar a year with no bonus until Citigroup is back in profit. On Tuesday, Geithner announced a new banking bailout package totalling $1.5 trillion, including the creation of a new fund into which banks can dump any remaining toxic debt.
