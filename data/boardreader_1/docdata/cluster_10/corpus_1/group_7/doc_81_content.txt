WASHINGTON -- Rep. Barney Frank asserted Thursday that the Obama administration can be more trusted than the Bush administration to ensure that banks do not misuse money they get from a $700 billion bailout fund.  Frank, D-Mass., denied in a nationally broadcast interview that Congress has failed to put strings on these loans to ensure that banks do not pay extravagant executive bonuses or take expensive retreats.  'We didn't give them the second half ($350 billion) with no strings attached,' Frank said on CBS's 'The Early Show.'  Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Lloyd C.
