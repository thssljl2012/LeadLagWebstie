NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators are not pursuing nationalization of troubled institutions struggling to shed toxic assets from their balance sheets, the head of the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said on Wednesday. 'Nationalization means different things for different people but nationalization is not the route we're pursuing now,' FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair told reporters after speaking to a group of bankers in New York.  Bair and other U.S. regulators are crafting a rescue package to help banks regain their footing by injecting capital, enticing private investors to buy bad assets and aiding millions of borrowers who have lost, or facing losing, their homes.  The FDIC is slated to release industry earnings and other financial data on Thursday for the fourth quarter. Many expect bleak financial results, but the one bright spot could be a growth in deposits, indicating consumer confidence. 'It's been a tough quarter,' Bair told the bankers.  She, however, told them some good news. 'Deposit growth was robust,' Bair said. 'Insured deposits are stable. They're staying in the bank. That's an important driver for our economy.' The FDIC is scheduled to hold an open meeting Friday to set new premiums for the second quarter. Premiums are what banks are charged for having their deposits insured by the FDIC.  The FDIC guarantees up to $250,000 per depositor when an insured bank fails. That amount only lasts through this year unless Congress raises it permanently from $100,000.  With a steady stream of bank failures this year and last, the FDIC is trying to replenish its deposit insurance fund but Bair warned bankers that they can expect to pay more for the federal backing. 'On Friday, we will have to raise premiums again,' Bair said. 'I'll warn you all now.'
