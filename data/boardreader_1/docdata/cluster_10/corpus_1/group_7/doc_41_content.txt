On two days in mid-September, when stock markets were roiled by the unfolding economic crisis, Credit Suisse Securities (Canada) Inc. failed to maintain the capital cushion demanded by regulators to safeguard client money.  The breach of the required level of 'risk-adjusted: capital was revealed Friday, when Credit Suisse agreed to a proposed settlement with the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC). Terms will not be disclosed unless the settlement is approved at a hearing to be held on Feb. 17 in Toronto.   Duncan King, a spokesman for Credit Suisse who is based in New York, said the dealer notified IIROC when it became aware of the possible capital shortfall and 'has taken steps to avoid similar situations.' 'No clients were affected and we were proactive in attempting to identify and to correct the deficiency,' Mr. King said. Switzerland-based Credit Suisse has operated in Canada since 1951. The firm employs about 100 people in Toronto and Montreal, with services including research and trading, and financial advisory. The capital issues at Credit Suisse's Canadian operation occurred the same week that U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers failed, dragged down by investment products linked to the bursting housing bubble in the United States. Stock markets in London, New York and Toronto collapsed as investors digested the previously unthinkable news, along with the stunning sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and looming bailout of insurance giant AIG. IIROC, a self-regulatory agency for the Canadian securities industry, has minimum capital requirements to protect client investments which are calculated based on a firm's assets and liabilities. Capital can take the form of share capital or subordinated debt. The regulator has the power to impose financial penalties, and to mandate changes to training and oversight for its members.
