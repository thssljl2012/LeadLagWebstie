Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the US government doesn't plan ''anything like'' a nationalization of banks that would wipe out shareholders.  Nationalization is when the government ''seizes'' a bank, ''zeroes out the shareholders and begins to manage and run the bank, and we don't plan anything like that,'' Bernanke said in response to questions at a House Financial Services Committee hearing today in Washington.  The Fed chief's remarks were more specific than yesterday, when he spurned outright federal control of banks in favor of a public-private partnership that the government would eventually exit. Bank stocks have fallen this month amid concern among some investors that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's financial- rescue plan could lead to nationalization of some lenders.  Bernanke today continued to draw a distinction between nationalization and a government minority interest with strict oversight and supervision.  Some banks won't need new injections of government funds after regulators complete stress tests to determine if they have enough capital to weather a deeper economic slump, Bernanke also said today.  In the case of Citigroup Inc., the government may end up with a ''substantial'' share of the lender's stock, he said. Officials in recent days have been grappling with how much more help they can provide Citigroup without diluting the value of shares held by investors too much, a person familiar with their deliberations said earlier this week.  ''We will see how their test works out, and we will see what evolves,'' Bernanke said. ''If in fact they have to convert even the existing preferred into common, then there could be a more substantial share of ownership of Citi by the US government.''  The government has already purchased $US52 billion ($80 billion) worth of preferred shares in Citigroup.
