Before a House committee today, banking CEOs had a rough ride.  Still, they denied wasting billions of dollars in the taxpayer supported Wall Street bailout.  Those eight top bankers came to Capitol Hill expecting to get grilled  The problem is that there is a great deal of anger at the institutions, said Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank.  We understand the taxpayers are angry and deserve to know how their funds are being used, responded Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis.  Wall Street and the banks took 387 billion dollars in round one of the bailout.  But lots of Americans still cant get loans  Start using the money we gave you - get it on the streets and dont tell us ...bonuses. Come on!! thundered rep. Michael Capuano (D-Massachusetts).  As Merrill Lynch failed and folded into Bank of America, the bosses paid out big bonuses.  New Yorks Attorney General today railed against that move by Merrill.  Andrew Cuomo said and you gave 700 people a million dollar bonus and then said taxpayers have to bail out Bank of America? No. That is repugnant. And its obnoxious and its wrong.  The CEOs today promised to spend less and write more loans.  Let me be clear with the Committee: I get the new reality and i will make sure that Citi gets it as well, pledged Citigroup CEO Vakram Pandit.  All this as President Obama wants trillions more in federal and private funds to get out more credit and mortgages.  Tags relating to this article:  No tags are associated with this article.
