With trillions of dollars of U.S. debt to be sold in 2009 amid soaring spending, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is looking for new primary dealers for Treasury bonds, Bloomberg reported Feb. 12.  Jefferies Group Inc., MF Global Ltd., Nomura Securities International Inc. and RBC Capital Markets Corp. are among four candidates in talks with the New York Fed, the news service said, citing company representatives at MF Global and Nomura and people familiar with the negotiations.  The news came a day after Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., which was recently acquired by Bank of America Corp., was delisted as a primary dealer. In 2008, fallen Wall Street firms Bear Stearns Cos. LLC and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. lost their status as primary dealers.  Nomura Securities International is a unit of Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. and RBC Capital Markets is a unit of Royal Bank of Canada.
