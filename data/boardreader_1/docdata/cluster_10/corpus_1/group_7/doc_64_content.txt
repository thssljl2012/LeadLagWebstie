The embattled chief executive of Bank of America had little choice but to publicly defend himself and to paint a bright picture of the bank's future today. BofA's stock fell to $3.77 yesterday, after starting the week at $6 and the year at $14.   So Lewis went on CNBC to respond to questioning by Maria Bartiromo, the same place John Thain sat last week following his abrupt firing by Lewis.   The full interview will be played later today on the network, but fortunately for Lewis, Bartiromo released excerpts of it this morning. Bank of America shares are soaring 27 percent, so something he said has resonated with investors.   Not surprisingly, Lewis isn't a fan of the executive pay caps proposed by the president earlier this week and he worries he'll be unable to retain talent should they take effect.   As for those persistent nationalization fears, Lewis will have none of it. He claims the idea has never come up once in his talks with regulators and legislators dealing with the bailout.   Overall, Lewis seemed calm, poised and willing to answer all questions. But it's easy to question whether or not he truly means what he says, based on this exchange:  When Bartiromo asked if Bank of America would need to raise more money, Lewis replied: 'Categorically, I can say no.' Remarkable. How can Lewis possibly answer that question with such conviction? This is the man who believed whole-heartedly that Merrill Lynch was worth $50 billion last September. (He admits today he overpaid). He was certain that the due diligence performed before the deal was sufficient and that Bank of America would be able to sustain Merrill's balance sheet.   And then came December, when Lewis was so blindsided by spiraling losses on Merrill's assets that he was forced to turn back to the government for $20 billion more in help. The only 'categorical' knowledge Lewis has about whether or not his bank will need more government money is that he simply doesn't know.   by Megan Barnett
