In getting bounced from Bank of America, John Thain not only lost his job, he got the rug yanked out from under him - an $87,784 rug, to be exact.  The area rug was one of many high-priced items Thain had Merrill Lynch buy when he squandered more than $1.2 million of the bank's money decorating his CEO office while the company was collapsing under the weight of the toxic assets it created.  Although rescued at the last minute in an overpriced acquisition by BofA, the stink of Wall Street's excesses and arrogance still lingers in the halls of Merrill Lynch.  Bank of America had no comment on Thain's indulgences, but said the incidents occurred last year while Merrill Lynch was still an independent firm run at the whims of Thain.  Some of the lavish spending that Thain signed off on during his reign over Merrill's swift decline included $28,000 for four curtains, a $10,967 lampshade, $87,784 for a pair of chairs, a $68,179 stationery cabinet and a $1,405 waste basket, according to documents obtained by CNBC's Charles Gasparino and TheDailyBeast.com.  The posh items were part of an overall look created by celebrity interior designer Michael Smith, who got $800,000 for his effort. Smith, coincidentally, is designing the Obama White House at one-eighth of the cost.  Bank of America insiders were said to be aghast upon learning of Thain's lavish spending as he was methodically firing scores of his employees, and his firm teetered precariously.  'A normal bank would gag at such outrageous expenses,' said one insider.  Bank of America, by right, owns the museum-quality furnishings, and Thain won't be permitted to cart them out to his Park Avenue co-op or his 10-acre Westchester estate.  The bank, however, could auction the fine pieces and any other artworks Thain may have left behind.
