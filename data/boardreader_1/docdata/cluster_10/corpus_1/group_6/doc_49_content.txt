NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most major U.S. companies have an ethics officer, but as investors survey the wreckage of a deepening financial crisis that has exposed behavior ranging from risky to downright illegal, one might ask 'What were they doing?' From Bernard Madoff's alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme, to the subprime mortgage crisis, to lavish spending on the chief executive's office at Merrill Lynch, the past year has seen a crisis of confidence in business that cost investors $6.9 trillion in U.S. stock market value last year. 'The rising market covered a lot of sins and a falling market exposes one's nakedness,' said Steve Priest, president of Ethical Leadership Group, a consulting firm that has worked with 50 of the biggest U.S. companies and firms in 40 other countries. 'Investors don't trust the companies they're investing in,' he said. 'They don't trust the financial statements, they don't trust the audits, they don't trust the bond rating agencies.' Lax lending standards left banks with too many souring loans and insufficient capital, contributing to the collapse of long-established Wall Street names like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and prompting a $700 billion U.S. bank bailout. Millions of ordinary Americans have seen their retirement savings hammered and hundreds of thousands have lost jobs.  All this should inspire companies to embrace the necessity for sound ethical practices. But experts in business ethics say not all companies have got the message. 'I don't think seeing dead bodies in the street always wakes people up,' said Roy Snell, chief executive of the Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics, which has 7,200 individual members who are compliance officers at companies ranging from small businesses to fast-food giant McDonald's. 'I've watched this for 13 years. There are always people rationalizing it, saying 'Our people wouldn't do that.''
