Chief Executive Ken Lewis on Wednesday reported buying 200,000 shares of common stock for about $1.2 million.Shares of the -based bank jumped 31 percent, or $1.58, to close at $6.68.  Lewis bought the shares on Tuesday -- a day during which the stock plunged 29 percent as fears about the bank's stability intensified. But some experts say Lewis' future might depend on how the rest of the week plays out.  "What happens the remainder of this week is critical in terms of seeing whether or not the shareholders give management at Bank of America a vote of confidence and management's sustained or a vote of no confidence, in which case we could see a leadership change at Bank of America," UNC  economist Tony Plath said.  Plath says, for now, the company's management will likely try to keep making up for its dismal fourth quarter report.He says that means job cuts could happen even sooner than expected.  "I think what you'll see is they'll move quickly to, in turn, implement the 42,500 job cuts that they've talked about over the course of the last three months," said Plath.  The more-than 42,000 job cuts are expected to be spread out between Bank of America and the two companies it recently acquired -- Countrywide and Merrill Lynch. A Bank of America spokesperson did return calls seeking comment.  Plath says keeping the bank's stock above the $5 mark is key to prevent major a sell-off and to maintain investor confidence.  Gordon Dowling, 92, a Washington resident who owns more than 200,000 shares of Bank of America stock, told News 14 Carolina that he's lost more than $10 million because of falling stock prices but he's still confident with the bank.  "I'm hoping it'll go up, but I'm not selling," he said.
