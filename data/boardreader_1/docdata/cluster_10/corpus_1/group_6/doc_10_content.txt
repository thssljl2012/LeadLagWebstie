Bank of America, the biggest US bank by assets, on Friday reported its first loss since 1991 and cut the dividend to a penny after receiving emergency government funds worth US$20bn to support the acquisition of Merrill Lynch.  The net loss to common shareholders, including the issuance of preferred stock dividends that the government receives from its preliminary capital investment, was US$2.39bn, or 48 cents per share. Analysts expected earnings of 8 cents per share.  The loss did not include Merrill's results. The recently acquired investment bank reported a loss of US$15.31bn, or US$9.62 per share. Bank of America cited severe capital markets dislocations for Merrill's huge loss.  Citing escalating credit costs, significant writedowns, trading losses and a deep economic recession, Bank of America slashed its dividend from 32 cents a share to just a penny. The bank had already cut its dividend in half in the previous quarter.  The US government said earlier today it will invest US$20bn in Bank of America and guarantee US$118bn of assets to help the company absorb Merrill and prevent the financial crisis from deepening.  The agreement is part of a commitment to support financial-market stability, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) said in a joint statement shortly after midnight in Washington.  Bank of America has now received a total of US$45bn in government aid. Before the latest injection, it had been the recipient of US$15bn in government capital in October, and US$10bn on January 9 - an investment that had been set aside for Merrill.  Bank of America's shares rose 11% in pre-market trading after falling 18.4% on Thursday and 36% so far this week on concerns that the bank may be crumbling as recession in the world's largest economy worsens.
