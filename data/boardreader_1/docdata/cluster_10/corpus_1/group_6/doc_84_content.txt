The only thing standing between Australia and the sort of catastrophic mess that Britain and America are heading into in 2009, and that Iceland is in now and that Ireland would be in if it wasnt part of the Euro, is the state of our banks.  Most of their banks are quite broke; Australias are okay&amp;so far. But the distance between us and them may be less than you think. Without the government guarantee, the big four banks would be totally unable to raise funding from international markets, and since around 40 per cent of bank funds in this country are supplied by wholesale markets, Australian banking would effectively shut down. Whats more, the banks are playing with fire by not reducing small business lending rates with the cut in the cash rate.  Thanks to pressure from all manner of politicians, mortgage rates have been cut by almost as much as the cash rate (2.75 per cent versus 3 per cent) but business rates have not been reduced at all. This might well turn out to be a self-destructive margin play by the banks.  For the moment, as we reported on Friday, the banks are in Kevin Heaven  but the Kevinless alternative is the hell being suffered on each side of the Atlantic. It has been a horribly dramatic few days.   On Friday analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland said that British banks were technically insolvent on a fully marked to market basis. Also on Friday the government of Ireland nationalised its third biggest bank, Anglo Irish.  Later the same day, the United States Government gave $US20 billion to Bank of America and guaranteed $US118 billion worth of its bonds to keep it afloat, after the bank announced a quarterly loss of $US1.7 billion.  And also on Friday, Citigroup announced an $US8.3 billion loss for the December quarter and a loss of $US18 billion for 2008 as a whole, and CEO Vikram Pandit announced plans to split the bank into two. Bloombergs headline on its story about this read 'Citigroups Pandit Tries to Save the Little Thats Left to Lose'. After crunching Citigroups quarterly report, an analyst a Deutsche Bank, Michael Mayo, estimated that its tangible common equity is now $US28.9 billion, or 1.5 per cent of its assets. Splitting the bank adds nothing to its equity.  Meanwhile in Iceland, where the banks took on liabilities 10 times the national GDP by betting on Britains property bubble, both inflation and interest rates are 18 per cent, and rising. A calamity has been visited upon the people by their bankers. The Observer
