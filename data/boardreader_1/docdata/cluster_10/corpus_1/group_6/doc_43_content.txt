Search  Query:  Independent.ie Web Search  Shares in Bank of America (BoA) dropped by more than 16pc to $5.57 following the exit of former Merrill Lynch chief executive John Thain with immediate effect from the newly combined bank.  The shake-up, which follows a report on CNBC about lavish spending by Mr Thain in redesigning his office at Merrill Lynch, is the latest setback to hit Bank of America, which earlier this month had to seek a government rescue. CNBC said that Mr Thain had spent over $1,400 on a waste-paper basket.  Shareholders reacted to reports he was locked in meetings in New York with Bank of America chief executive Kenneth Lewis to discuss the terms of his departure. The bank confirmed yesterday the two men had 'mutually agreed' the situation was not working out.  Any package linked with Mr Thain's departure will emerge later, the bank said, adding that Thomas Montag, head of global markets, formerly Merrill, will remain at the company, despite reports to the contrary.
