The deal is similar to one Citigroup reached with the government late last year. Meanwhile, Citi said it would split itself in two to help it better handle its riskier assets. 'As long as we see the government backstopping losses, it allows the marketplace to take on a little bit more risk,' said Kevin Giddis, managing director of fixed income at Morgan Keegan.

Yields went up in Treasurys, but they went up because investors were seeking higher yields in other fixed income products.' Stocks seesawed throughout much of the day, but managed to close higher.
