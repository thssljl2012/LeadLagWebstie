NEW YORK: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's fourth-quarter profit plunged 76 per cent as it wrote down bad loans, signaling that even the bank that has avoided the worst of the credit crunch is struggling with the recession.  Excluding special items like gains from its takeover of Washington Mutual, JPMorgan would have posted a loss. But the second largest US bank by assets also said it expects more than $1 billion of gains this year from its acquisition of Bear Stearns, and its shares rose 3.4 per cent in premarket trading.  'The numbers are a very pleasant surprise in a very ugly environment,' said Michael Holland, founder of Holland &amp; Co, which owns JPMorgan shares.  JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said last month that the bank had performed poorly in November and December, blaming what he called the 'normal culprits:' mortgages, junk bonds, and loans funding buyouts.  Analysts in recent days have expressed more concern about the economic outlook, which may have spurred JPMorgan to report results six days earlier than originally planned.  Albert Edwards, a Societe Generale strategist, said on Thursday that the US economy looks likely to enter a depression, and China's could implode.  JPMorgan said fourth-quarter net profit dropped to $702 million, or 7 cents per share, from $3 billion, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 0.9 percent to $17.2 billion.  Excluding one-time items, it had a loss of 28 cents per share, much worse than analysts' average forecast of a profit of 1 cent, according to Reuters Estimates. The big miss was due mostly to jump in loan loss reserves.  Dimon called the results 'very disappointing.'  The bank has managed to turn a profit so far during the year-long recession, but it still faces significant headwinds. Its losses from the September acquisition of failed thrift WaMu may be up to 17 per cent higher than originally expected, the bank said in a presentation accompanying its earnings release.
