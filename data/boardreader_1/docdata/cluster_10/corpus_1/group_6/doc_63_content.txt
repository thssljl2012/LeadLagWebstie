Mary Jo Herseth, a former LaSalle Bank executive kept on by new parent Bank of America Corp. as market executive for its private wealth management arm, has left the company. Herseth is the second former LaSalle executive who stayed on for about a year after BofA bought LaSalle but who has left abruptly.   In December, Mark Sander left as head of Midwest commercial banking for BofA.   Herseth couldn't be reached for immediate comment.   In November 2007, U.S. Trust, a BofA arm catering to the wealthy, appointed Herseth as head of its Illinois and Michigan operations. At LaSalle Herseth was executive vice president for LaSalle's wealth-management unit.   BofA acquired LaSalle in October 2007.   A BofA spokeswoman said client service won't be affected. She said this is part of an ongoing series of management announcements being made as BofA integrates Merrill Lynch, which it just acquired.   A replacement for Herseth hasn't been named yet.   byerak@tribune.com
