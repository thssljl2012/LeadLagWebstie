CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Shareholders of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. on Friday approved the investment bank's sale to Bank of America, a move that will create the nation's largest financial-services firm.  During a special shareholders meeting at company headquarters in New York, Merrill shareholders approved the sale, bringing to an end the independence of an investment bank founded in 1914.  Bank of America shareholders approved the deal later in the day. 'I'm happy with it, but I still think it is a gamble,' said Sam Brooks of Wayland, Mass., who was among several shareholders that spoke at the 90-minute meeting.  Under terms of the transaction, Bank of America would exchange 0.8595 of its common shares for each Merrill Lynch common share. Based on Bank of America's closing price of $14.34 Thursday, the deal was valued at just less than $20 billion; the plunge in value since the $50 billion deal was announced reflects the devastating losses in financial-sector stocks since then.  The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals.
