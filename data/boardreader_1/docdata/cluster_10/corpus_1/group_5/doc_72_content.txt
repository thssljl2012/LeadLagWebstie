Smaller lenders see turmoil in financial world as chance to increase market share  As many of the biggest U.S. banks continue to pare back their mortgage lending, some smaller financial institutions see global financial turmoil as an opportunity to pick up market share.  The eight largest mortgage lenders, as measured by total volume in the first nine months of 2008, reported declines in originations from a year earlier, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication in Bethesda, Md.  In the third quarter, total mortgage originations fell to $300 billion, down nearly 50 percent from a year earlier.  The declines partly reflect lower demand as the U.S. economy slows down, as well as tighter credit standards by leery lenders. At the same time, traditional mortgage-loan giants are facing a tougher challenge from some lenders that usually dont get mentioned with the industrys heavyweights.  But at U.S. Bancorp, mortgage originations by the Minneapolis regional banks U.S. Bank Home Mortgage unit jumped 35 percent to $25.95 billion in the first nine months of this year. That was one of the biggest increases of any lender tracked by Inside Mortgage Finance.  'We are making loans to everybody who qualifies,' Richard Davis, the banks chief executive, said.  One reason for the banks growing popularity: U.S. Bancorp has largely stayed out of the headlines in recent months as other lenders failed. Net income at U.S. Bancorp decreased by nearly 40 percent in the third quarter, but deposits rose 10 percent from a year earlier.   The Wall Street Journal
