Bank of America says it is to cut up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years.  The move comes amid sharp economic slowdown stemming and the company's acquisition of Merrill Lynch. 'Bank of America expects to have a final plan early in 2009 and estimates it will project the reduction of approximately 30,000 to 35,000 positions over the next three years,' a statement said. The company said the job cuts would come from both within the bank and at Merrill Lynch.  It will affect all lines of business and staff units. 'Details as to specific reductions in communities or by business line have not been determined,' the statement said. 'As many reductions as possible will be made through attrition.' Bank of America said that the reductions were designed to eliminate 'redundancies' resulting from the merger with Merrill Lynch.  The layoffs is seen as one of the largest rounds of job cuts in the financial services industry.  US banking giant Citigroup said last month it was slashing a near-record 50,000 jobs worldwide.
