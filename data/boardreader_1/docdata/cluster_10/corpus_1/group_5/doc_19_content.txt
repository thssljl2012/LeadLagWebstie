CHARLOTTE, N.C.  Shareholders of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. yesterday approved the investment banks sale to Bank of America, a move that will create the nations largest financial-services firm.  During a special shareholders meeting at company headquarters in New York, Merrill shareholders approved the sale of the company, bringing to an end the independence of an investment bank founded in 1914.  Bank of America shareholders approved the deal later in the day. Im happy with it, but I still think it is a gamble, said Sam Brooks of Wayland, Mass., a bank shareholder who spoke at the meeting.
