 NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N The bank is delaying payments to 401(k) plans until the end of the year for employees earning between $50,000 and $250,000 a year, the person said.  The total contribution to these employees' plans will be decided at the end of the year and it may be reduced, the person added. The source wished to remain anonymous because the information has not been released officially.  Employees in the plan who earn less than $50,000 a year will receive contributions each pay period as normal and employees earning over $250,000 do not qualify for the plan, according to the source.  JPMorgan declined comment.  The second-largest U.S. bank told investors last month it expects to shed as many as 12,000 jobs from integrating the former Washington Mutual Inc, up from 9,200 announced in December. It also expects to cut up to 2,000 investment banking jobs.  The New York-based lender is seeking to cut costs as consumers grapple with falling house prices, tight credit and increasing mortgage and credit card defaults.
