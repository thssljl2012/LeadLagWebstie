New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is filing a request to end a confidentiality order that keeps private the details of bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch employees just before the firm was sold to Bank of America.  On Friday, a judge will determine if a temporary order keeping the information confidential should be made permanent. Cuomo's request was filed Wednesday.  Cuomo's office and Bank of America Corp. are fighting over the release of the information. Charlotte, N.C.-based BofA has said it would provide Cuomo with the information about individual bonuses if he agreed to keep it confidential. Cuomo has refused.  Cuomo's office is investigating the timing of $3.6 billion in bonuses New York-based Merrill paid to employees in December. (
