Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America at the start of the year Investment bank Merrill Lynch has confirmed that it has discovered a trading 'irregularity' based out of its London office.   The US company said it had immediately contacted financial regulators, and was working closely with authorities to 'thoroughly investigate the matter'. It added that 'risk[s] surrounding possible losses are under control'. Merrill has been a part of Bank of America since January after it was bought in a $50bn (35bn) rescue deal.  Bad debts   The UK financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, told the BBC it could not comment on whether any individual companies were under investigation.  Media reports have named one particular trader that Merrill Lynch is investigating, but there has been no official confirmation.  Merrill had to be rescued by Bank of America after it built up multi-billion-dollar bad debts linked to the sharp downturn in the US housing market that was at the centre of the continuing credit crunch.  The takeover deal was first announced last September.  Analysts said at the time that despite Merrill's high profile woes, the deal was a good fit for Bank of America, as it added Merrill's investment banking operations to its own predominantly retail bank business.  However, Bank of America's shares have lost 75% of their value since the start of the year.  Former Merrill chief executive John Thain resigned at the end of January.  Merrill made a loss of a loss of $15.31bn in the last three months of 2008.
