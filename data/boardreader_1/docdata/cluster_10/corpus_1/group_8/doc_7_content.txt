John Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., pressed for a $40 million bonus for selling his company to Bank of America Corp., according to the testimony of Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis.  Lewis said that his executives spurned Thain's request. 'He was told very strongly that you should not do that; that you would damage yourself with the Bank of America board if you do that, and if you ever wanted a chance to be in the running for my job then that would eliminate it,' Lewis said, according to a transcript of his testimony to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office.
