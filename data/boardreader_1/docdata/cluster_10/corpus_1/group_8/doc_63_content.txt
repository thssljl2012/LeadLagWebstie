From Louise Story, a DealBook colleague:  The office of Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Wednesday filed yet another appeal in state court seeking the release of the names of Merrill Lynchs top earners last year.   Bank of America, which bought Merrill last fall, has been fighting the release of that information.  Included in the filing are 129 pages of transcripts from interviews Mr. Cuomos office held with executives tied to the matter, including the firms chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis; John Finnegan, the Chubb chief executive who headed Merrills compensation committee; and John A. Thain, Merrills former chief executive.  It appears from the transcripts that the bank did not try to lower Merrills $3.6 billion bonus pool in December, after learning that the securities firm would lose far more money than expected in the quarter.   The depositions also shed more light on Merrills decision to speed up its bonus payments. Mr. Thain asked his boards compensation committee on Nov. 11 to move the payouts from their usual timing in January to December. In his testimony, Mr. Lewis says that the bank tried to dissuade Merrill from paying the bonuses out earlier.
