 Citigroup plans to sell its 26% stake in Japanese online broker Monex Group Inc as part of the struggling US bank's efforts to raise cash, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Friday.   Shares in Monex, Japan's second-largest online brokerage in terms of customer accounts, fell 8% on the report, cutting the value of Citigroup's stake to 14.1 billion yen ($144 million).   Citigroup, which has received $45 billion of US taxpayer funded capital injections since October, appears to have already sounded out several financial institutions on the Monex stake, the Yomiuri reported.   Yoshito Shimoyama, a spokesman at Nikko Citi Holdings Inc, Citigroup's holding company in Japan, declined to comment.   Citigroup is also trying to sell Nikko Cordial, a bricks-and-mortar retail broker with 109 branches across Japan. Japan's top three banks-Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc-have shown an interest in buying Nikko Cordial, sources have said.
