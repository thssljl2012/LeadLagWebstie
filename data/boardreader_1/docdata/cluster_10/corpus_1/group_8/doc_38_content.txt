Investment bank Merrill Lynch said it was investigating an 'irregularity' within its trading operation in London.  The bank, now owned by Bank of America, has informed regulators, but would not comment on reports naming a London trader as the focus of the inquiry.  A spokeswoman said: 'Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control.'
