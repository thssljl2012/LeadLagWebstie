LONDON   MARK Aedy, Merrill Lynchs European head of corporate and investment banking, is stepping down as the US bank struggles to retain staff after its purchase by Bank of America. Aedy, who is also in charge of the Middle East and Africa, was leaving after nine years , spokeswoman Victoria Garrod said on Friday.   Bank of America is trying to hold on to its top bankers after more than $40bn in write-downs and losses. Many Merrill executives have left since Bank of Americas takeover, including CEO John Thain; Greg Fleming, head of investment banking; and Robert McCann, who led the wealth-management unit.
