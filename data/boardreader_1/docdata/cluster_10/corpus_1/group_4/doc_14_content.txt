US giant Citigroup was rescued in the biggest banking bailout yet as the American government made a 13.3billion transfusion of emergency capital into the group.  It also guaranteed up to 205billion of the global banking group's risky loans, which have brought the banking giant to the brink of collapse.  Citi's precarious position has attracted some predators who are ready to pounce on parts of the bank's empire. HSBC chairman Stephen Green yesterday said he would not rule out a move for some of Citi's businesses.  Asked if he would look at Citi's assets, Green said: 'It would depend. We have a clear strategy that says we're going to develop our business with a primary focus on emerging markets and that for us primarily means, because of our footprint, Asia, Middle East and South America.'  Citi was left vulnerable after investors deserted it, leaving its shares down 60 per cent last week, as fears grew that it might not have enough capital to withstand expected sub-prime losses of over 13billion expected to rain down on it next year.  Saved: The US government poured 13.3billion of emergency capital into troubled Citigroup's coffers in the biggest banking bailout yet  The plan follows a 16.7billion injection of public funds into the bank last month from the US government's 468billion Troubled Asset Relief Programme.  Citi has lost more than 13.4billion in the last year as a result of the global financial crisis after being hit by four consecutive quarterly losses.  Rory Robertson, interest rate strategist at Australian bank Macquarie, said: 'It's all good stuff but the fact that the Fed has to bail out one of the biggest banks in the world is not exactly a vote of confidence.'  Under the plan, Citi will issue 18billion in preferred shares to the US Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This preference stock will pay an annual dividend of 8 per cent to the government's coffers.  Citi is also required to pay a quarterly dividend of no more than 1 cent a share for the next three years, down from 16 cents in the most recent three month period.  Unlike the US bailouts of insurance giant AIG, and mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, no management scalps were required. However, the agreement does give the government control over executive compensation.
