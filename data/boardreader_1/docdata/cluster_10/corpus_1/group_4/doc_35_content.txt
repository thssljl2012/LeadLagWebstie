It's not that stocks can't fall further. You can bet that patience and resolve will be tested time and again before this bear goes into hibernation. We haven't seen the complete capitulation and outright despondency that historically marks a bottom. Not yet. Main Street consumer confidence is at a 40-year low, but Wall Street still has too many optimists. A return to early October's dramatic lows may change their minds.  But for a longer-term, retirement-focused shareholder -- and that's most of us -- selling stocks just because they could fall further not only locks in losses, but also makes it less likely that you'll participate in powerful market rallies.Trading Strategies: November 2008           MULTIMEDIA     Test your trading skills against MarketWatch columnists with the .  Missing those days can be hazardous to your wealth. 'A lot of the recovery tends to occur in the first few months, and if you wait until the all-clear sign to get back in, you'll have missed out on a lot of the gain,' said Mark Riepe, head of the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Look at what would have happened if you'd been out of U.S. stocks on the best trading days between January 1998 and December 2007. The Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 Index (SPX:SPXNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) returned 5.9% annualized over that time, but had you been sidelined for the decade's 10 biggest days, the yearly gain would have been just 1.1%, a Schwab study shows. Miss the top 20 days and you'd have suffered a negative 2.6% return; miss the top 40 days and you'd have lost 8.4% annually. Put another way, staying invested through thick and thin would have beaten a poor market-timing effort by more than 14 percentage points a year. Moreover, market recoveries typically start strong. The average return for stocks in the 12 months following the end of a bear market is 45%, but if you sat out the first six months of the rally, that 12-month return becomes just 12%, according to Schwab. 'Trades in reaction to fear and panic are almost always bad trades,' said Kristi Mitchem, a managing director at Barclays Global Investors. 'It's not a decision you should enter into without making sure that's really where you want to go,' she added. 'Make that shift very intentionally, not with the idea that you're trading out of equities to get back in when the market recovers. The likelihood is that you'll miss that recovery.' Bottom fishing Of course, most of us understand that being out of the market forfeits potential gains. But with trading volatility in the stratosphere and stock prices in a downward trend, who's brave enough to catch a falling knife? We can't all be Warren Buffet. Or can we? Much has been made of Buffett and other celebrated value-minded investors going bargain hunting. Yet Buffett's famous admonition: 'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful' is easier said than done -- and for Buffett, at least, probably easier done as well. Buffett was scorned by some for a New York Times editorial on Oct. 17 that encouraged investors to buy U.S. stocks. The criticism recalled the ridicule he received for a Fortune Magazine article in late 1999 warning investors to lower their expectations and to beware of a technology-stock bubble. And let's not forget Buffett's barbed attack on futures and other speculative derivatives in 2003 as 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' You could lose a lot of money ignoring Buffett. Instead, take a page from him about what to buy and sell -- not when. The key point of the Times article is that this sage investor isn't turning away from Treasury bonds because the stars are aligned for stocks. He's buying because the solid companies on his wish-list are being tossed out with the junk. 'Investors are right to be wary of highly leveraged entities or businesses in weak competitive positions,' Buffet wrote. 'But fears regarding the long-term prosperity of the nation's many sound companies make no sense. These businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups, as they always have. But most major companies will be setting new profit records 5, 10 and 20 years from now.' What to do SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- If you didn't see the market's meltdown coming, you have plenty of company. If you're selling now, it's probably too late.
