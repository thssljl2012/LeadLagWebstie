NEW YORK (Reuters) - Herbert 'Bart' McDade, former chief operating officer of Lehman Brothers Holdings , is leaving Barclays Capital at the end of November, a spokeswoman said. Barclays  acquired Lehman's U.S. investment banking businesses last month after Lehman's holding company filed for bankruptcy. McDade was on the transition team to help integrate the two banks' businesses. McDade replaced Joseph Gregory as COO in June, days after Lehman said it expected its first ever loss as a public company. McDade had previously headed the equities business, and before that, the fixed income business. (Reporting by Dan Wilchins, editing by Richard Chang)  2008 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.
