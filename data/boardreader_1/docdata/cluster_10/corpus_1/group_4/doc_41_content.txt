 According to the newspaper, Credit Suisse's investment banking unit has allocated $231,900 in the period for the 'average' employee (down 30%), and Deutsche Bank has allocated $221,000 (down 38%).   The Financial Times reports that Barclays Capital isn't having it all it's own way bagging former Lehman staff. According to the newspaper, not all the senior Lehman bankers (not already with BarCap) that Barclays President Bob Diamond invited to a private dinner recently took him up on the offer. The FT also says that 'Project Destiny', which apparently involved certain BarCap bankers sitting in a hotel room in Canary Wharf waiting for Lehman bankers to come in and 'ask for a job', didn't pull in the punters that Diamond had hoped.  CNBC reports that Commerzbank has confirmed that it is to tap the German government for $13.3bn in bailout money. The bank also announced that it made a third-quarter loss of $684m, said that it may not pay any dividends this year or next, and confirmed that next year's management salaries would be pegged at 2008 levels.  Finally, Societe Generale has posted its third-quarter earnings a couple of days early. Profit fell 84% in the period to $234m, after almost $2bn in various writedowns. The investment bank posted a $297m third-quarter loss in the period.  Please use the 'E-Mail' button immediately under the article title to send this item to a friend.
