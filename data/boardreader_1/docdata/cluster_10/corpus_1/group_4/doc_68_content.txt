(BizWorld)   The value of funds serviced in Ireland reached close to the USD2 trillion mark by the end of June and was worth USD1,934.9 billion (E1,228.7 billion), reflecting annual growth of 18pc, latest research from Lipper, Thomson Reuters' specialist fund subsidiary reveals.   Lipper's fourteenth annual edition of the 'Ireland Fund Encyclopaedia' shows that total net assets in Ireland-domiciled funds reached USD1,240.8 billion (up from USD1,100.1 billion the year before) in 3,125 funds and sub-funds as at 30 June 2008.  Ed Moisson, Director of European Fiduciary Operations at Lipper, commented, 'Ireland's fund industry continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate. The industry's success in servicing non-domiciled funds, as well as money market products, has served it well of late and should continue to do so in current circumstances.' For fund servicing companies, Lipper shows that this year BNY Mellon took the largest market share for fund assets under administration (USD335.3 billion) with State Street International ranked second.  However, the positions are reversed for assets under custody and State Street International is first (USD313.6 billion).  Both companies have topped USD300 billion in each category for the first time.  Among Dublin's professional firms, A and L Goodbody offers legal advice to the largest proportion of funds serviced in Ireland, with 1,049 funds, ahead of Dillon Eustace (985 funds).  PricewaterhouseCoopers continues its lead across all funds audited as at 30 June 2008, with 1,990 funds serviced in Ireland.  Of 353 fund management companies with funds domiciled in Dublin, US fund management companies account for the largest proportion by total net assets (USD531.6 billion).  Of the largest fund promoters, Barclays/BGI has assets under management of USD163.9 billion, followed by Goldman Sachs (USD99.9bn), HSBC (USD56.3bn), BNY Mellon (USD48.5bn) and Russell Investment (USD45.7bn).
