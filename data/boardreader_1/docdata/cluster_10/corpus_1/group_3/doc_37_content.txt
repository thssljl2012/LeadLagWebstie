A University of the Philippines professor and leading economist on Thursday warned that the worst effects of the troubled American economy has yet to be felt by ordinary Filipinos.However, she said all is not lost for the ordinary citizens as the national government has in its power the means to protect the citizenry. Increasing budget allocations on health, education, environment and agriculture is an urgent matter that the national government must consider, she said.Briones urged legislators to do away with double allocations and vague provisions in the proposed budget even as she called on the government and civil society to work together to monitor and ensure that funds for social development are released and actually used. "The release of all funds for social development and making sure that they are actually used as intended would greatly make a positive impact to the masses," she said. According to Briones, ordinary Filipinos are in for a longer period of suffering even with the impending approval of the $ 700-billion bailout package for Wall Street.The United States government has been working for the approval of the bailout plan in the hope that the economic crisis could be stemmed before causing further damage to the global economy.Briones noted that the ordinary people had already been bearing the consequences of the meltdown since last year, the start of the crisis, which culminated with the fall of financial giants American Insurance Group (AIG) and Lehman Brothers last month. "I do not see any immediate effect of the bailout plan as the funding is yet to be sourced, besides the fact that the whole package would be released in tranches," she said. The former national treasurer said that the trade sector would be the first casualty in the economic fallout as the US is the country's major trading partner. "Manufacturers and exporters would feel the brunt of the economic slowdown. When production falls, jobs would be lost," she said. Briones also noted that the global crisis might lessen the demand for overseas Filipino workers, one of the safety nets being considered by the government, and does not discount the possibility that Filipinos living in the US might decide to come home.Thus, she suggested realignments in next year's budget to possibly avert these scenarios and soften its blow on the Filipino masses.
