Thomas Galvin, CorrespondentThe roots of the current financial crisis are in the debt and bad money loans linked to declining housing equity.Home prices were steadily increasing and many, many new homes were being built all over the country.In order for people to buy houses, they need to take out loans from banks. Loans that meet a certain criteria, called conforming loans, are sold by local banks to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the secondary market.Once everyone who qualified for a conforming loan received one, there wouldn't be any more homebuyers and the housing boom would end. If more buyers could be found, more homes could be built and existing homes would go up in price.Subprime lenders, most of which have gone bankrupt such as Countrywide, IndyMac, New Century, Washington Mutual and others, would loan money to people who did not qualify for traditional loans.Instead of the secondary market, these loans were collected, repackaged and bought by Wall Street firms (Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and others), who would later sell these securities to their clients.In order to protect themselves from the risks of homeowners defaulting on their loans, default insurance was purchased from companies such as AIG.When home prices collapsed and no more buyers could be found, the subprime lenders lost their source of income, fees from new loans, plus they were responsible for the loans they could not sell. The market for thesehome loans disappeared and mark-to-market accounting rules meant that Wall Street firms would have to write off massive amounts of debt.AIG could handle a couple of loans defaulting but not all of them at once and needed to borrow money from the government.This impacts the average American in that debt is going to become very expensive.Banks and other creditors are concerned with saving money to pay off bad loans rather than loan the money out to businesses and consumers that would be able to put that money to good use.The $700 billion bailout package is a short-term solution for the government to buy debt from lenders, allowing them to continue issuing loans to businesses and consumers.Thomas Galvin is a research associate at Colliers International commercial brokerage firm in Ontario who uses econometrics to study Inland Empire real-estate trends and produce theory models.
