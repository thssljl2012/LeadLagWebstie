Barclays is close to securing  from Middle Eastern governments, including Qatar and Abu Dhabi, in a move that will allow the UK bank to boost its balance sheet without turning to the British state for cash. Barclays executives were last night finalising the terms of the capital increase with investors including the Qatar Investment Authority and an Abu Dhabi-based SWF. An announcement could be made as early as today, although people involved in the negotiations warned they could still fall apart or drag into the weekend. A cash injection would largely fulfill Barclays pledge to raise 6.5bn in fresh capital as part of the UK-sponsored recapitalisation of Britains largest banks.
