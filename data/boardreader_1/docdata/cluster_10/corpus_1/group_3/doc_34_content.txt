JAPANS top broker Nomura Holdings Inc. is to buy bankrupt Lehman Brothers' global back-office operations based in India, retaining the workforce of more than 2,000, newspapers said today. Nomura, which is already buying Lehman's operations in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Europe, will acquire the Indian businesses for several billion yen (tens of millions of dollars), the Nikkei business daily said. The back-office operations, based in Mumbai, handle trading settlement duties as well as information technology (IT) research and development. Nomura reportedly decided to make the extra investment as the Indian base has talented IT workers and has functioned as the heart of Lehman's cutting-edge systems. Nomura declined to comment. The Japanese broker moved swiftly to buy up Lehman's operations in Europe and Asia after the once-mighty Wall Street titan was brought down by the financial crisis that has rocked world markets. It could not touch the global back-office when it clinched a deal to buy Lehman's Asian operations because it was under the wing of the North American business, which is being bought by Barclays of Britain, the Asahi Shimbun said. The workforce in India will bring the number of Lehman employees taken on by Nomura to about 8,000, the newspaper reported.
