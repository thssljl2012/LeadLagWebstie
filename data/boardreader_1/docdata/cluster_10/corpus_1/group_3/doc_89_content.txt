NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City's economy could lose 165,000 jobs in the next 24 months, almost double the estimate made in July, Comptroller William Thompson said on Tuesday. Wall Street is the city's most important industry as each of these high-paying jobs help support two to four workers in other sectors, from shops to law firms, economists say. The once high-flying sector has been walloped by the global credit crunch that has led to the record bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc and government rescue of insurance giant AIG. The Democratic city comptroller also increased his forecast for the number of securities industry workers who could get pink slips. He now estimates 35,000 of these employees will be cut, up from 25,000. 'The differences reflect the spreading of the economic troubles to other industry sectors as the nation slips into a general recession,' he said in a statement.   YellowBrix, Inc.
