Across the world, shares were in the red. In Europe, benchmark indexes in France and Germany also plunged almost 10 per cent in early trading. Spain's Ibex stock index was down more than six per cent. Austria's financial watchdog stopped trading in all securities if they swing more than 10 per cent and introduced a ban on short-selling to try and ease the turmoil.Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed down 9.62 per cent in its worst session since Black Monday in 1987.

On paper, the losses are worth $8.3trillion.A temporary ban on short-selling in the U.S. - the practice of making money from falling share prices - has also now expired, adding to the turmoil.David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp;amp; Poor's in New York said: 'Right now the market is just panicked. Nobody wants to take on any risk. Everybody just wants to get their money and put it under the mattress.'   The world's economic powers are under huge pressure to act boldly together in a bid to try and stop the crisis from escalating further.Financial leaders from the G7 group of rich countries, including Chancellor Alistair Darling, are meeting in Washington today to discuss their next move.Mr Darling is expecting to urge them to follow Britain's lead and recapitalise banks in the hope it will restore confidence and kick-start wholesale markets.Later today, President Bush is due to make another statement about the crisis in a bid to reassure the U.S. people officials are doing everything to restore stability.'Politicians must be scared by now, looking at stock markets and the problems in the credit markets,' said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist at CFC Seymour Ltd in Hong Kong.'Much more needs to be done,' he said. 'The G7 has to announce that they will provide massive capital injections and guarantees for the inter-bank market.'  At the centre of a financial crisis, now almost a month old, credit markets remain in deep distress because banks are so desperate to hang onto the money they have.Until they start to lend to each other, there is little hope of relief for people in need of money for mortgages or to keep their businesses going during the slowdown.In the latest attempt to ease the panic, the U.S. and Dutch governments are preparing to follow Britain's lead and shore up the capital of banks.The U.S. Treasury plans to start injecting capital in banks as early as this month, according to a source close to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.This would mean an even larger role for the U.S. government, making it the lender and investor of last resort. Until this week, American policy had been to focus on buying up banks' 'toxic' mortgage debts but experts hope recapitalisation might be a more direct strategy.  Japan's export-dependent economy has now been dragged into the crisis thanks to rising bankruptcies in the property sector and among small businesses.'This is panic,' said Takashi Ushio, head of investment strategy at Marusan Securities in Tokyo. 'Paulson will have to definitely promise the injection of public funds, and then he'll have to make the timing of this very clear.'The International Monetary Fund yesterday announced that a $200billion (116billion) fund would be made available to struggling governments.Relaunching measures last used during the Asian financial crisis of the 90s, it pledged to answer calls by any countries facing problems.

'There is no domestic solution to a crisis like this one,' he said.Here's what readers have had to say so far. Why not add your thoughts below? 'Why do we need a society based solely on Greed of the few...?' Andrew, Marham Quite right: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' - Philip, London, 10/10/2008 13:50Right from the start, I have said, let the banks sort their mess out. NO Bail OUTs. Those banks that fail would in-turn take those that took high risks to task. New banks could have emerged and like the law of the jungle, the strongest (wise banking practice) would survive. That in turn would have allowed the markets to correct itself, build confidence and move on. Now despite all the bail outs, banks still aren't lending, investors have no clue how everything will still pan out. The only ones LAUGHING now are those useless bankers...!- eric victor, uk, 10/10/2008 13:47Why do we need a society based solely on Greed of the few, of the aquistion of wealth and money, isn't this the opportunity to move beyond these things. ?- andrew, marham, 10/10/2008 12:22**yourComments**- **name**, **townAndCountry**, **creationDate** Click on the icon below an article to save to your favourite stories file
