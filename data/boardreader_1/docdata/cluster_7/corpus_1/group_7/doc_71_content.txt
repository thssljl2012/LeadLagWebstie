Companies ramped up plans for spending in the final months of last year despite the global economic slowdown, forcing economists to take a second look at weak growth estimates.  Business spending for the three months to the end of December skyrocketed 6%, from an upwardly revised 1.6% rise in the September quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.  The increase surprised analysts, who expected a 3% contraction, seasonally adjusted - and prompted at least one economist to upgrade growth expectations for 2008.  The strong private capital spending nudges the economy a little further from the path of a recession.  'The strength of business investment in the fourth quarter is surprising and at odds with the collapse in business confidence, the plunge in real capital imports and weak business conditions, as reported in business surveys,' Westpac economics division said.  Economists at the bank upgraded their forecast for 2008 to 1.5% from 0.8%.  For the quarter, they expect growth to register at 0.5% from minus 0.1%, the bank said.  Annual GDP growth figures will be released by the ABS next week.  Today's figures on capital spending were foreshadowed by a higher-than-expected 1.7% forth quarter gain in completed construction work released yesterday.
