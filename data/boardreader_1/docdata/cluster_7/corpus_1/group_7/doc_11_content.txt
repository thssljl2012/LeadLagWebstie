TOKYO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt prices inched up in Asia on Tuesday as the market awaited details of a bank rescue plan from the U.S. government and weighed up a newspaper report that Russia's banks were seeking talks on debt repayment.  Investors were also awaiting the first leg of this week's record $67 billion Treasury refunding, starting with $32 billion worth of three-year notes on Tuesday as the first test of demand.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield touched its highest in more than two months on Monday as investors worried about the market's ability to absorb the issuance.  But traders said uncertainty surrounding U.S. plans for a financial rescue plan, and whether it would include a 'bad bank', had hurt Asian stocks and given Treasuries some support.  'We've had some volatility in stocks,' said a senior trader at a European bank.  The Nikkei Japanese daily said Russian private lenders would ask Moscow to renegotiate with European and other foreign banks to postpone repayment of up to $400 billion of loans.  The report sent the euro down more than 1 percent against the dollar and the yen, with investors concerned about the euro zone's business and banking ties to Russia.  'The U.S. Treasury market is a little better bid on the back of that story and people are going to wait to see if there's any lead to that in the European opening,' the senior trader said. 'But you've still got a lot of supply.'  A Russian banking industry official later said the report was untrue, that corporate debt restructuring was only an idea and no proposals had been submitted to government.  The benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.977 percent, about a basis point down from late U.S. trading and below Monday's peak of 3.05 percent.  The yield has risen almost 1 percentage point since touching 50-year lows in December, largely on concerns about the prospect of swelling issuance to fund the government's economic rescue efforts.  The Treasury has said it plans to issue $1.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion this fiscal year, an estimate which excludes the cost of a economic stimulus package working its way through the Senate and the financial rescue package due to be unveiled on Tuesday.  The two-year note was unchanged in price to give a yield of 1.020 percent. The three-year note rose 5/32 to yield 1.433 percent, 3 basis points down from U.S. trade.  The Treasury will sell 10-year debt on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday.  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is expected to announce the widely awaited financial stability plan at 1600 GMT to help rescue troubled financial institutions.  Three sources briefed on the plan told Reuters it included a a public-private partnership that can buy up to $500 billion of distressed assets, but not a standalone government 'bad bank'.
