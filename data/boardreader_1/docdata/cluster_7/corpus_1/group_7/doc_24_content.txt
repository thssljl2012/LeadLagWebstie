Job vacancies fall 11pc in February Wages grow, but big pay rises unlikely  AUSTRALIA'S employment outlook is increasingly bleak as the number of job vacancies fall sharply and pay packets grow at a far slower rate.  Data released today from the  (DEEWR) showed its skilled vacancies index in February was 46.4 points, 52.4 per cent lower than in February 2008.  Vacancies fell in all three occupational groups monitored by the department.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior economist Michael Workman said the latest data reflected a tight employment market in 2008, before the impact of the economic slowdown took effect. 'It is fairly obvious given those skilled vacancies falls again today that the wages numbers are likely to move under 1 per cent a quarter over the next year.' ABS data out today showed total hourly rates of pay, excluding bonuses, rose 1.2 per cent in the December quarter. The wage price index rose 4.3 per cent from a year earlier.  Mr Workman said further large rises in wages would be unlikely given forecasts of an higher jobless rate. 'There is not much a problem on the wages front, particularly if it looks likely that unemployment rate pushes up to 7 per cent by the third quarter next year,' he said. DEEWR found trade vacancies declined 12.4 per cent, associate professionals fell 7.5 per cent and professionals dropped 6.3 per cent.  The fall in skilled vacancies was widespread, with decreases also evident in 17 of the 18 professions.  The largest fall was in printing trades, down 29.4 per cent.  The only occupation to rise was marketing and advertising professionals, increasing 0.4 per cent.  All states and territories experienced decreases in skilled vacancies in February, the largest drop being 14.8 per cent in Western Australia.  Similarly, all states and territories suffered declines in the year to February, led by NSW with a fall of 62.1 per cent.
