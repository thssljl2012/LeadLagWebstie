 (RTTNews) - Tuesday morning in Asia, the New Zealand dollar plummeted to new multi-day lows against most major currencies as a further retreat in stock prices reduced the appeal of higher-yielding currencies. The kiwi slumped to an 11-day low against the greenback, 1-week low against the aussie and a 4-day low against the yen. But the kiwi climbed against the euro.  New Zealand stock market opened marginally lower today, following Monday's negative leads from the markets across the Asia Pacific region and Europe. The benchmark NZX 50 index was down 1.08 points or 0.04% to 2,679.10 shortly after the market opened for the day, while the broader NZX All Capital Index fell 1.68 points or 0.06% to 2,697.69.  The New Zealand dollar, which closed yesterday's trading at 0.5180 against the US currency, fell to an 11-day low of 0.5127 during early Asian deals on Tuesday. The next downside target level for the kiwi-greenback pair is seen at 0.496.  In early Asian trading on Tuesday, the New Zealand dollar slipped to a 4-day low of 47.28 against the Japanese yen. On the downside, 46.5 is seen as the next target level for the kiwi. At Monday's close, the kiwi-yen pair was quoted at 47.53.  An index measuring activity in Japan's service industry was lower by a seasonally adjusted 1.6 percent in December compared to the previous month, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said today. That was in line with analyst expectations following the revised 1.1 percent monthly decline in November. The original figure was reported as a 0.9 percent monthly decline.  Against the Aussie, the New Zealand dollar dropped to a 1-week low of 1.2597 in early Asian trading on Tuesday. This may be compared to yesterday's New York session close of 1.2578. If the kiwi weakens further, it may likely target the 1.275 level.  The board members of the Reserve Bank of Australia believed that any economic stimulus would have little effect in the short term but could spur growth later in 2009, minutes from the board's February 3 monetary policy meeting revealed today.  At the meeting, the RBA reduced the nation's benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 3.25 percent, taking the rate down to its lowest value since 1964.  During early Asian deals on Tuesday, the New Zealand dollar strengthened against the euro and reached a high of 2.4520 at 8:15 pm ET. The near term resistance level for the kiwi is seen at 2.431. The euro-kiwi pair was worth 2.4779 at Monday's close.
