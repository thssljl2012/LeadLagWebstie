* Q4 business investment +6.0 pct, vs forecast -3.3 pct  * Firms pare spending plans for 2008/09 fiscal year  * Market trims chance of interest rate cut next week  SYDNEY, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Australian business investment defied expectations of a slump and rose strongly last quarter in a sign the economy might have dodged a recession for now, though firms did pare back future plans in the face of global gloom.  The Aussie dollar gained and investors pared the chance of a cut in interest rates next week after the government reported capital spending jumped 6.0 percent in the fourth quarter to an inflation adjusted A$24.9 billion ($16.2 billion).  The rousing result stunned analysts who had looked for a fall of 3.3 percent or more given how the global financial crisis had intensified in the quarter, hammering the price of Australia's main resource exports.  'This strength is a surprise and means Australia might have narrowly avoided a negative quarter for growth,' said Su-Lin Ong, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets.  'We suspect it'll be the last hurrah for investment and it's downhill from here,' she added. 'But it's enough to fuel talk the central bank could stay on hold next week.'  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds its monthly policy meeting on March 3 and the market has been divided on whether it will ease again, having already cut by a massive 400 basis points to a record low of 3.25 percent.  'Today's data further raises the risk that the RBA stays on hold next week, taking time to assess the outlook further,' said Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS. 'Clearly, the data do not imply, as yet, a deep recessionary investment outlook.'  Business investment accounts for only 10 percent of Australia's A$1 trillion in gross domestic product (GDP), but is susceptible to wild swings with a big impact on growth.
