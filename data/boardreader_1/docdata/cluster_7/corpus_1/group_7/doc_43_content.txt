The Australian dollar was firmer at noon, as investors gained confidence US authorities would pass President Barack Obama's huge fiscal package. At 1200 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6705/06, up from Monday's local close of $US0.6657/62. During the morning, the local currency traded between $US0.6698 and $US0.6798. The Australian dollar started the local session higher at $US0.6783/87 at 0700 AEDT, as investor sentiment to risk rose on hopes the US Congress would pass President Obama's fiscal stimulus package, worth about $US827 million ($1.229 billion) this week. The US Senate voted to end its debate on President Obama's recovery package. US Senators will move to a final vote on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT), after which the bill will go through yet another round of negotiations with members of the House of Representatives. RBC Capital Markets senior currency strategist, Sue Trinh, said the Australian dollar started firmer from the lift in confidence about the possible passage of the US fiscal stimulus package. But reports of a Russian Association of regional banks rejigging their loan portfolios with foreign banks had lowered markets' sentiment to risk. 'The Australian dollar has taken a leg lower (this morning) with the rest of the major currencies on news that Russian banks and businesses may be asking foreign banks to reschedule their loans worth $US400 billion,' Ms Trinh said. 'That has seen risk aversion injected back into a market that had otherwise been rather exuberant for at least the past two days on hopes that the US stimulus package will get passed.' Ms Trinh said the fall in the National Australia Bank (NAB) monthly business survey's measure of business confidence, down 12 index points in January to minus-32 points, was 'pretty dismal'. A level below zero indicates that pessimists outnumber optimists. 'Conditions are record lows, which is not helping the Aussie dollar,' Ms Trinh said. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Glenn Stevens will deliver a speech to a conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at 1945 AEDT on Tuesday. 'The market will be breaking down his speech for any insight into the future path of monetary policy,' Ms Trinh said.
