(RTTNews) - The New Zealand dollar fell from a 6-day against the Japanese yen and 5-day high and the US dollar and the euro during Wednesday's early Asian trading.  New Zealand's merchandise import and export volumes declined in the final three months of 2008, Statistics NZ reported today, but the falling value of the NZ dollar caused prices to rise.  The report stated that seasonally adjusted import volumes declined 4.8 percent for the December 2008 quarter. The volume of passenger car imports declined 27.1 percent while capital goods were down 7.7 percent.  The value of Q4 imports increased 3.4 percent, with the most significant factor being an 18.3 percent hike in mechanical machinery prices tied to higher prices for computers and machinery parts.  Extending Tuesday's uptrend, the New Zealand dollar rose to a 6-day high of 50.03 against the Japanese yen in Wednesday's early Asian deals, by about 7:30 pm ET. The kiwi then reversed the direction and is now trading at 49.33. The pair closed yesterday's New York deals at 49.70.  In economic news from Japan, core machinery orders fell 3.2 percent in January compared to the previous month, the Cabinet Office said today, coming in at 718.3 billion yen. That marks the fourth consecutive month of decline, making it the state's longest losing streak ever.  Also, the Bank of Japan said that Japan's domestic corporate goods price index was down 0.4 percent in February compared to the previous month, posting an index score of 105.0. That was better than analyst expectations that had called for a 0.6 percent fall on month after the 1.0 percent decline in January.  Against the European currency, the New Zealand dollar pulled back after rising to a 5-day high of 2.5119 by about 6:30 pm ET, Tuesday. The kiwi dropped to 2.5353 versus the euro by about 11:40 pm ET, compared to 2.5213 hit late Monday in New York. If the kiwi slides further, 2.568 is seen as the next likely support level.  The German producer price index and factory orders reports may influence trading in the euro pairs in the upcoming session.  The New Zealand dollar pared some of its gains against the US dollar after rising to a 5-day high of 0.5065 by about 8:25 pm ET, Tuesday. The New Zealand dollar that closed Tuesday's New York deals at 0.5036 is now trading at 0.5007.  Across the Atlantic, the Energy Information Administration is due to release its weekly oil inventory report at 10:30 am ET. At 2:00 pm ET, the Treasury Budget, a monthly account of the surplus or deficit of the federal government is scheduled to be released. Economists expect the budget for February to show a deficit of $200 billion.  Against the Aussie dollar, the NZ currency weakened to 1.2890 by about 10:30 pm ET Tuesday, after rising to 1.2806 by about 7:20 pm ET. At Tuesday's New York session close, the Aussie-kiwi pair was quoted at 1.2845.  According to a private sector survey, the consumer sentiment in Australia declined slightly in March.

A total of 55,628 loans were issued in the month, the fourth straight month of increases.  For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com
