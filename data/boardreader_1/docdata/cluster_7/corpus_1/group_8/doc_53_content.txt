The euro continued to hit high against its US counterpart Friday as Asian stock markets soared overnight, raising hopes of more gains in European equities as well.   The 16-nation euro bought $1.2922 in European morning trading, up from the $1.2770 late Thursday in New York. The British pound bought $1.3916, also higher from the $1.3714 the night before.  Stronger overseas markets and economic data often encourage investors to expatriate investments from the safe haven of the dollar, diminishing its value.   In other trading, the dollar bought 98.03 Japanese yen, up from 97.43 yen the night before in New York.   Asian markets rose Friday as the prospect of fresh stimulus measures in China and Japan and upbeat signals from major U.S. firms like Bank of America sparked hopes of a turnaround in the world economy.
