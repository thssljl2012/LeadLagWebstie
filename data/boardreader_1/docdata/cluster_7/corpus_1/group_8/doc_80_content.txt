SYDNEY - Australia's economy contracted by 0.5 per cent in the last quarter of 2008, the government said Wednesday in an unexpected announcement that suggested the country may be entering a recession.   The news surprised economists and analysts who had expected the Australian Bureau of Statistics to report a slight increase in GDP. But the bureau said the GDP fell by 0.5 per cent in the last quarter in seasonally adjusted terms.   Australia is not yet in a recession - technically two quarters of negative growth - because a narrow rise of 0.1 per cent was reported in the third quarter.   For the year, the economy expanded 0.3 per cent, the ABS reported.   The market reacted negatively to the announcement, with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropping 1.9 per cent and the dollar also falling more than half a U.S. cent to 63.28 U.S. cents.   The growth figures came a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates unchanged, explaining that the Australian economy was weak but 'has not experienced the sort of large contraction seen elsewhere.'
