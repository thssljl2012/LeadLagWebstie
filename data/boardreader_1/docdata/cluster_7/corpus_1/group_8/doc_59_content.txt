Money markets are betting on a smaller cut in the Official Cash Rate next week, after the Reserve Bank of Australia left its benchmark interest rate on hold earlier this week.  The 90-day bill rate, which was at 3.04% before the shock decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday, rose to 3.17% at the close on Thursday.  However, BNZ economist Stephen Toplis says the Australian decision will not neccesarily influence Reserve Bank thinking on interest rates next Thursday.  He says recent Australian economic data has been better than expected while the figures in New Zealand have been at least as poor as anticipated.  Deutsche Bank chief economist Darren Gibbs says a run of good economic news in the past few days may help deliver a smaller cut, of half a percentage point.  He says milk powder prices have improved globally and there are signs the Auckland housing market is beginning to pick up from very low levels.  ASB economist Jane Turner points out that more mortgages in Australia are on floating rates giving the Australian central bank more room to hold fire on rates.  She says New Zealand's Reserve Bank has to cut rates by more to get the same 'bang for its buck' from monetary policy and for this reason is predicting an Official Cash Rate cut of one percentage point next Thursday.
