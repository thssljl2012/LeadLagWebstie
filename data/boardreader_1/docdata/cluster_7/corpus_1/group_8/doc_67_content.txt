Australia's interest rate stands at 3.25 percent now.  * Heightened expectations of rate cuts spurred investors to  pile into shorter-term bond futures, extending earlier gains.  * Three-year bond futures rose 0.07 points to 96.975,  and the 10-year contract added 0.04 points to 95.73.  * The RBA skipped a chance to cut rates at its monthly policy  meeting last week, saying it preferred to wait and see the  effects of its massive 400-basis-point easing since September.  * The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) cut rates by 50  basis points on Thursday to a record low of 3 percent, although  the move confounded expectations among some investors for a  bigger cut.  * RBNZ's rate cut pushed the Aussie lower against the Kiwi as  investors pared expectations for bigger interest rate  differentials between Australia and New Zealand.  * Aussie dropped to NZ$1.2644, from Wednesday's  NZ$1.2830.  * Revised data showed on Thursday Japan's economy shrank 3.2  percent last quarter, confirming the Japanese economy is fighting  its sharpest contraction since the oil crisis in 1974.
