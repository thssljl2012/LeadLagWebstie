Australia's central bank has left interest rates unchanged at 3.25 percent.  In making the announcement, Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Glenn Stevens, said the economy was riding the global downturn better than many others.  He said the current weakness in the economy would be helped by other stimulus measures that would support demand in the short term.   The bank has slashed 400 basis points from the official cash rate since September in response to the global financial crisis.  The government in February halved its economic growth forecast to just 1.0 percent for 2008-2009 and tipped the unemployment rate to surge to 7 percent in 2009-2010.
