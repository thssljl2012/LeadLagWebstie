(RTTNews) - The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its Official Cash Rate (OCR) to a record-low 3.00 percent on Thursday.  RBNZ Governor Alan Bollard announced the 50 basis point cut, hinting strongly that the current round of interest rate cuts is at or near the end.  In a statement accompanying the rate announcement, Bollard noted the rapid deterioration of the world economy late last year. 'While monetary and fiscal policy responses in many countries have been substantial, we still expect the adverse economic forces generated by the crisis to remain dominant throughout 2009,' he said. The timing and extent of global recovery remain highly uncertain.' Thursday's move brings the total reduction in the OCR to 525 basis points since the round of cuts began more than six months ago.  Bollard also hinted that the rate reductions may be nearing an end. 'As economic activity troughs, we expect the rapid easing of monetary policy to slow,' Bollard said. 'We do not expect to see in New Zealand the near-zero policy rates of some countries.' Reaction to the announcement was swift from Australia and NZ Bank, New Zealand's largest commercial lender. ANZ announced it was passing the lower rates along to its customers with an across-the-board 50 basis point cut for business, agricultural and household loans.  Westpac Bank NZ, meanwhile, reduced its floating mortgage rate by 0.4 percent and its fixed lending rate by 0.20 percent, saying other rates are under review.
