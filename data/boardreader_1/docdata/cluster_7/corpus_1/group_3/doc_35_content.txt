The US Congress has passed historic legislation aimed at bailing out the nation's troubled economyThe lower house of the US Congress, the House of Representatives, backed the bill by 263-171. The $700bn rescue package will be targeted at buying up the bad debts of numerous Wall Street institutions.The approval of the Bill came as members voted on the proposals a second time after they shocked and 'disappointed' world leaders by rejecting the measures on Monday.The Senate stepped in midweek and passed the Bill first by adding more than 100 billion dollars (56.9 billion) of so-called 'sweeteners' to the proposals, piling pressure on the House to follow suit.President Bush says he will quickly sign the $700 billion federal bailout bill into lawThe United States' House of Representatives today approved a new version of the country's 700 billion US dollar (396bn) bail-out plan for banks.The Bill will now go through an 'enrolling' process in the US Congress - a form of housekeeping to ensure the Bill passed by the House today and the one passed by the Senate on Wednesday are the same and that it is ready for President George Bush to sign.It will then be sent to the President's desk, where HR 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act of 2008, will be signed into law, possibly as early as later today.Mr Bush is expected to make a statement on the Bill shortly.In the UK, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the global financial crisis required new ways of governing and set out new plans for a National Economic Council which will meet for the first time on Monday.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said the Bill would help 'shine the bright light of accountability' on the financial markets and added that the passage of the 'very serious piece of legislation' was done with 'an eye on the future'.She said the US had faced 'terrible ramifications for everyone on Main Street' while the world was focused on Wall Street.'We were dealt a bad hand, we made the most of it,' Ms Pelosi said.She added that she thought the Bill could have been better under different circumstances.Democrat Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, said the 'process of compromise may look messy' but added that it 'significantly improved the legislation'.He said the government could now begin taking strong action to restore the flow of credit.Democrat James Clyburn, the House majority whip, said he was hopeful the US had now 'gone a long way to restoring confidence in our markets' and to restoring 'credibility and confidence in our body politic'.What effect will the bail-out have on the current financial crisis?Q: Does this mean the crisis is over?A: Far from it, but it is a step in the right direction. The move should begin to restore confidence to the markets and boost liquidity as banks should be less reluctant to lend to each other now that the so-called toxic assets are being removed from their balance sheets.If the deal had not gone through, it would have had a severe impact on confidence and certainly made the situation worse, but there is still a long way to go before things return to normal.Q: How long it will it take before the scheme starts to improve things?A: World stock markets are likely to receive a short-term boost from the scheme's approval, but this will be limited as it had been widely expected to pass.The key issue relating to the scheme is what price the US government will pay for the assets. If they pay too much they will be strongly criticised, but if they pay too little the scheme will not have the desired effect. Pricing the assets is likely to take several weeks and may even have to be done on a case-by-case basis, meaning nothing will change overnight.Q: What impact will the scheme have on the UK?A: Some UK banks, such as Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, are likely to be able to take part in it. It has been estimated that UK banks hold around 95 billion of assets that will qualify for the scheme.There should also be some indirect benefits. Banking is a global industry and just as the problems that began in the US have spread to the rest of the world, so should any improvements.If banks are more willing to lend to each other again, this should also help to bring down the inter-bank lending rate, Libor, which could filter through to cheaper mortgage rates.Q: What other action are central banks taking?A: Central banks have poured billions of pounds of liquidity into the money markets in recent weeks.The Bank of England also announced today that it would widen the scope of its funding lifeline for the banking sector, allowing banks to use some highly rated corporate and consumer loans for the first time as collateral for its weekly cash injection.Any improvement to world financial markets is likely to be due to a combination of the efforts being made by central banks and the US bail-out plan.Q: Are the current problems confined to the banks?A: No. The credit crunch began as a banking problem but its impact has spread across the economy. The problems in the mortgage market have exacerbated the housing market downturn, which in turn has badly hit consumer confidence, contributing to lower retail sales.Q: Will the Bank of England cut interest rates next week?A: The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is now widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday for the first time since April, with some commentators saying there is a chance they could shave as much as 0.5% off the official cost of borrowing.But while this is obviously good news, it is thought that one cut alone will not be enough to make a significant difference to the problems the economy faces.Q: What about inflation?A: Inflation still remains high at 4.7% - more than double the Bank's target rate of 2%, and some economists argue that this will prevent the MPC aggressively cutting interest rates by 0.5% next week. But inflation is expected to peak at around 5% next month, before falling rapidly during early 2009, opening the door for further cuts in the official cost of borrowing.Q: What is the economic outlook like?A: Not good. Economic fundamentals have deteriorated sharply in the past few week, leading to warnings that the MPC can no longer afford to sit on its hands. The latest figures show that activity in the manufacturing and service sectors has now fallen to record lows, while house prices fell at the fastest rate ever recorded during the year to the end of September. Unemployment is rising and the chances of the UK going into recession are increasing after economic growth stalled during the second quarter.
