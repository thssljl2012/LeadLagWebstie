The worst could still be yet to come for small businesses as banks start to look more and more shaky, the Forum of Private Business has said.The small business lobby group said it was concerned that high street banks are beginning to reduce credit facilities and increase overdraft charges at a time when small businesses are most in need of funding.Following the merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB last week, the FPB is warning that less choice between banks could mean that, as the credit crunch continues, the services offered to small firms are diminished.Recent research carried out by Cambridge University shows that, although the number of small firms seeking finance in 2007 increased only slightly from 2004, when the previous survey took place, the level of funding required soared from an average of 82,000 to 470,000. That figure is likely to have increased markedly over the past year, the FPB added.FPB chairman Noel Guilford said: It appears that, just as the funding requirements of small businesses are increasing because of the economic downturn, banks are cutting back on both the level of facilities they provide and the services they offer, said the FPBs Chairman, Noel Guilford.Accessing finance in order to maintain a healthy cash flow is always a key issue for small firms  now it has become a matter necessary for survival as much as growth.He added: The FPB is urging banks to recognise the difficulties small businesses are facing, and firms to take steps to protect themselves, such as seeking alternatives to traditional funding streams.Mr Guilford said the major problems facing small businesses in the current banking turmoil included reduced borrowing capacity; reduced service capacity as banks cut staff ; branch closures; and the possibility of banks reducing their borrowing and calling in loans.With additional bank charges and tighter lending facilities, small businesses are increasingly struggling to access the finance they need. The FPB is advising its members to review their business practices to make the most of the cash that is available.Finance will come to be the key issue over the next 12 months, said the FPBs tax adviser, Mike Benson.As well as normal business loans, many small businesses have relied on remortgages and even credit cards for funding.
