Inflation is expected to have remained elevated in the September quarter, but economists say this will not deter the central bank from cutting interest rates aggressively.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut the cash rate by 100 basis points, or a full percentage point, at this month's board meeting in a bid to cushion the economy from slumping global growth and ease the strain on credit markets.It was the most aggressive monetary policy easing since May 1992, when the economy was emerging from recession, and returned the cash rate to six per cent for the first time in almost two years.While the usual suspects - the cost of petrol, housing and financial services - remain central to high inflation, ICAP senior economist Adam Carr said the events of recent times had taken the focus away from rising prices.'The threat posed by the credit crisis far outweighs any concerns over inflation,' Mr Carr said.'The reality is the credit crisis does have the potential to lead to a recession and that has to be dealt with first.Economists expect the headline consumer price index (CPI), the key measure of inflation, to record a rise of 1.1 per cent in the September quarter for an annual pace of 4.9 per cent, an AAP survey of 12 economists showed.The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will release the CPI data on Wednesday (October 23).The headline CPI rose 1.5 per cent in the June quarter, for an annual rate of 4.5 per cent - the largest annual increase in twelve and a half years.In terms of monetary policy, the RBA's focus is on the underlying measures of inflation - the weighted median and the trimmed mean - which exclude volatile prices from CPI calculations.Economists expect the average of the two measures to rise 1.0 per cent in the September quarter for an annual pace of 4.5 per cent.Underlying CPI inflation rose 1.1 per cent in the June quarter, for an annual rate of 4.4 per cent, which was a near 17-year high.
