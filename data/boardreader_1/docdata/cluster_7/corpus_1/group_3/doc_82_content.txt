Demand for credit grew at its fastest pace in six months in the wake of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) quarter of a percentage point in September.The RBA's monthly credit report released today shows that total demand for credit grew 0.7% in September, the largest monthly increase seen March.However, this was insufficient to stop the annual rate easing to 10.1% compared to 10.5% in August.Back in December 2007 when the the global financial crisis was still in its early stages, annual credit growth was racing along at over 16%.Still, the RBA cut its key cash rate by a further 100 basis points to 6% this month, and is expected to lower the rate gain by 50 basis points when the central bank holds its monthly board meeting next Tuesday.
