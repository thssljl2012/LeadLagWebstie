Top U.S. banks are evenly split on the chancesfor furtherinterest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, according to a Reuters pollconducted after thecentral bank's latest rate decision.The Fed slashed rates by another 0.5 percentage point on Wednesday, bringingthe overnight fedfunds rate to 1 percent, its lowest in four years.But U.S. primary dealers, banks that deal directly with the Fed, were at aloss in predictingfuture moves given the current environment of extreme uncertainty.Six out of the 12 banks polled said the Fed was done cutting rates, but theremaining six sawroom for further easing.'The Fed repeated that downside risks to growth remain, which means that 1percent is not thehard floor on the funds rate,' said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist atDeutsche BankSecurities in New York.Now that official borrowing costs are matching the rock-bottom rates of2003-2004, which manynow say helped fuel the housing bubble, analysts were trying to figure out whatmight come next.If the economy continues to worsen, as many expect it will, the Fed willlikely be forced intotaking further actions.'The FOMC statement makes it very clear that the economy has moved into andwill remain in aperiod of extremely weak activity,' said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economistat RBS Greenwich.One possibility is a policy of 'quantitative easing,' whereby the centralbank would resort tooutright purchases of U.S. Treasuries in order to bring down market interestrates.A similar policy was employed in Japan when it faced the threat ofdeflation, which many say isbecoming a more serious risk for the United States.Some analysts say that by buying up tarnished assets and widening the rangeof collateral thatis acceptable for loans, the Fed and Treasury are already engaging in sucheasing to a certainextent.Others note that bringing fed funds below 1 percent would risk disruptingalready fragile moneymarket funds, something the central bank would be loathe to do.(PCT)What else canFedFedFed funds Fed do as itAction Fundsbottomruns out ofCOMPANYDec 16 bottom?when?ammunition?----------------------------------------------------------------------------Banc of America Cut 25 0.75--Barclays Capital Cut 25 0.75DecemberRamp up liquidity facilityBNP ParibasNo Move 1.00OctoberQuantitative easing, moreasset buysCantor FitzgeraldCitigroupCredit SuisseNo Move 1.00OctoberLiquidity policy &amp;amp; balancesheet expansionDaiwa Securities No Move 1.00October-Deutsche BankNo Move 1.00December-DresdnerNo Move 1.00DecemberBuy corporate debtGoldman, SachsHSBC SecuritiesJ.P.
