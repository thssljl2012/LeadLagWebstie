Australian shares surged in early trade after Wall Street staged an amazing afternoon rally with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rocketing 11%.Shortly after the open, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 was up 2.5%, or 94 points, to 3888.6 points.Shares in BHP rose as much as 4.9%, or $1.24, to $26.60, while Fortescue shares jumped as much as 11.7%, or 34 cents, to $3.25..ANZ shares gained as much as 5%, or 85 cents, to $17.78, Commonwealth Bank rose as much as 4.6%, or $1.82, to $41.20.Macquarie Group shares were up as much as 10.5%, or $2.88, to $30.39.''The Dow's jump is certainly the biggest rise we've seen for decades,'' Ausstock senior client adviser and strategist Michael Heffernan said before the market opened.'It's an enormous rebound on the market and the anticipation of rate cuts (in the US) tomorrow.'Forecast for rate cuts in the US this week, along with an expected interest rate reduction by the Reserve Bank next week - tipped to be cut to 5.5% at the least - have lightened the mood among investors, he said.'We might be in a for a little bit of a relief period going ahead for the next few weeks,' he said.Despite the spike, the outlook for economic growth and profits over the longer term continues to grow more dire.Economists at JP Morgan said Australia was likely to enter a recession by the end of the year - and downgraded their growth expectations for the second time in two weeks.Growth forecasts for 2009 have been moved down to 0.7%, from 1.4%, after being downgraded last week from 1.8%.For 2008, the Australian gross domestic product growth is now seen at 2.1%, down from 2.5%.'These new forecasts include expected falls in Australia's GDP in Q4 2008 and Q1 2009 - if realised, the coming quarters will define the first technical recession in Australia since 1990-91,' JP Morgan economist Stephen Walters wrote in a note to clients.'The contours of Australia's coming recession have become clearer in recent weeks.''The outlook for Australia's export volumes and commodity prices has been darkening in line with global growth prospects.''We also have become even more down-beat on the outlook for the consumer - we anticipate virtually no growth in household spending in 2009.'Today, the market will also be looking for more indications about how the Federal Government's deposit guarantee will play out among mortgage funds and other investments not covered under the assurance.Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan yesterday rejected a government guarantee on market-linked instruments sought by the financial services industry. They instead proposed a plan to allow non-banks to become regulated banks, which then allows them to receive the protection of the government guarantee.Mr Rudd and Treasurer Swan also pledged $83 million to boost the budgets of financial regulators such as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority which would be needed for its additional workload if more non-banks convert to a banking structure.
