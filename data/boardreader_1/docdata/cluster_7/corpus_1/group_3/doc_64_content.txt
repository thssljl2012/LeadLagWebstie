The nation's biggest bank by assets, National Australia Bank Ltd, expects full-year cash earnings to be around $3.9 billion, as it brings forward its annual reporting date to provide clarity on its financial position.NAB said Thursday morning it would announce its full year results on October 21 - a week earlier than first planned - 'in order to provide the market with additional clarity on its financial position'. 'The decision to bring forward the release of the 2008 full year results has been made in the interests of providing certainty to the market and does not foreshadow any proposed material announcement,' NAB said Thursday. The bank said it had made the decision to bring forward its results announcement 'three weeks ago, while markets were experiencing extreme levels of volatility and uncertainty'. NAB said cash earnings for the 12 months to September 30 would be around consensus, estimated to be approximately $3.9 billion. 'The Group will report strong capital and liquidity ratios, with Tier 1 clearly above 7 per cent,' NAB said. 'The Group's September 2008 final dividend per share is expected to match its March 2008 half year dividend per share. 'NAB intends to further strengthen its capital position having regard to ongoing global economic uncertainty.' The bank said the current Tier 1 ratio had benefited from capital raised equal to the (dividend reinvestment plan) shortfall on the Group's first half dividend payment. 'The Group intends to continue this general strategy for the next two dividend payments. 'The Group will continue to explore opportunities to utilise Tier 1 hybrid capacity.'
