Australia's jobs market is in for a rocky ride over the next two years, with some economists predicting the unemployment rate rising as high as 11%, as consumer spending is curtailed and economic growth falls.Many economists think the federal government's $10.4 billion fiscal stimulus package and still strong Chinese economic growth would give Australia some protection from an expected global economic recession.However, all agree jobs will be lost, as consumers struggle to pay off their debt burden.The best case scenario is for a jobless rate of 11% by 2010, according to a Sydney academic who has also forecast official interest rates falling to zero over the same time frame.But on a worst case basis, University of Western Sydney associate professor of economics and finance Steve Keen says one in five people could be out of work by 2010, as sky-high household debt levels weigh on demand.That would be the highest level since the Great Depression almost 80 years ago, when the jobless rate peaked at 29%.'That would be a worse-case scenario ... I hope it doesn't hit that level,'' Dr Keen said. 'It could be worse than the Great Depression but I hope not.'This is a far bigger crisis than the 1990 recession and a far bigger level of debt.''Australia's unemployment rate stood at 11.1% in 1929, at the start of the Great Depression.JPMorgan chief economist Stephen Walters said this week he expects the jobless rate to jump to 9% by 2010, throwing more than 1 million people out of work, as softer economic growth in China hindered the domestic labour market.September 1994 was the last time the nation's jobless rate started with a nine, when it hit 9.1%.That jobless rate was also challenged in December 1992, after the last recession, when 10.9% of Australians were without jobs.But Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief economist Michael Blythe, who is more optimistic, saying the jobless rate, now at 4.3%, was likely to peak at 5.5% by late 2009.'The economy is slowing and that will be a factor in the jobs market,'' he said.Mr Blythe said recent interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the government's stimulus package, directed at helping high-spending groups like pensioners, parents and first-home buyers, should limit a rise in the jobless rate.'We're still recording positive jobs growth: there are more people getting jobs than losing them,'' he said. 'We've now had 15 months of the financial crisis and we're still in that position.''Mr Blythe said falling labour costs and an eventual recovery in the Chinese economy would help the jobless rate fall back to 5% in 2010.Australian Treasury estimates the jobless rate will climb to 4.75% by mid-2009 as the global economy slows and credit conditions tighten.But Dr Keen said the Treasury forecast, contained in the May budget, had failed to take into account Australia's spiralling debt levels, which have doubled as a ratio of gross domestic product since 1990.'They've completely missed this phenomenon,'' he said.About 480,000 people are out of work now, compared with 10.7 million people who have a job, Australian Bureau of Statistics data show.
