New Zealand banks may start following the lead of their Australian counterparts by requiring a registered valuation for every home loan they provide.The move would be aimed at reducing the level of risk in the banks' mortgage portfolios but may also increase the cost of taking out a home loan.Patrick Ryan, residential valuation services director for real estate company CB Richard Ellis (CBRE), said there were major differences in the mortgage approval process in this country compared with Australia, even though most New Zealand banks were owned by their Australian counterparts.The biggest difference was that in this country, banks or other lenders did not usually require a registered valuation of a property when approving a mortgage application, while in Australia a registered valuation was required as a matter of course.The other major difference was that in this country, if a bank did require a valuation, it was usually left to the borrower to choose the valuer, while in Australia the banks controlled the whole process, Ryan said.He cited the intense competition between New Zealand banks in the lucrative home loan market as the main reason they did not routinely require registered valuations.They had tried to simplify the loan application process as much as possible for their customers. 'If you've got one bank that's dictating that customers must get a registered valuation and another that doesn't, the one that doesn't is more likely to get the business because there is one less hurdle for the customer,' he said. But he believed New Zealand banks would start following the Australian model. 'The current economic crisis will provide the impetus for the major banks to do that. In my discussions with many of them they have indicated they are seriously looking at it now. It's all about mitigating risk. I think you will see all institutions having a close look at their lending policies,' he said. However, any changes may be slow in coming. Banks spoken to by the Sunday Star- Times say they are not planning any major changes to their mortgage approvals process in the short term.A Westpac spokesman said the bank did not intend to start requiring registered valuations for all mortgages.The likelihood that they eventually will was behind CBRE's decision to set up a residential valuation service at a time when the amount of valuation work being undertaken had fallen away dramatically.The company has been a major player in the commercial property market for many years but began providing residential valuations only in July.However, if the banks do start routinely requiring a registered valuation before approving a mortgage, they would also be likely to control which firms undertook the work. CBRE was therefore seeking to build up its business relationships with the banks.One trend which had emerged was for lenders to require a 'forced sale assessment' as well as a normal registered valuation to be prepared for loan applications, Ryan said.He also acknowledged that the public's confidence in registered valuations had been affected by the Blue Chip scandal, in which investors had purchased properties with valuations which were grossly inflated compared to the properties' resale value.
