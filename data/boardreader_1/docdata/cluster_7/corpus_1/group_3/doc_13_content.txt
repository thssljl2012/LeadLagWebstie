(AsiaPulse via COMTEX) -- BTIVF   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- Wealth manager BT Investment Management Ltd (ASX:BTT) is concerned about the contagion effect of a funds freeze by its competitors and is working hard to ensure it has enough liquidity to meet investor redemptions.After eight of BT's large competitors froze redemptions on mortgage funds in the past week, BT chief executive Dirk Morris said the company was keeping a watch on its own liquidity to ensure it could meet redemptions.'Yes, of course I'm concerned, as is our broader parent, Westpac (AS:WBA),' he said of a possible contagion effect caused by a funds freeze.'We're working very closely with our parent to ensure we have liquidity to meet redemptions,' he told analysts today after unveiling the company's fiscal 2008 result.Fund outflows from high margin equity products had only started over the past few weeks.'It's only modest,' Mr Morris said of the outflows.BT, which only listed in December 2007, today reported a statutory pro-forma fiscal net profit of $14.3 million.Its pro-forma cash net profit was $40 million.In February, it forecast its annual cash net profit to be 10 per cent to 15 per cent below its prospectus forecast of $45.7 million.Commonwealth Bank of Australia's wealth management arm, Colonial First State, yesterday became the latest big funds manager to freeze redemptions from its mortgage funds after the federal government said it would not extend its guarantee on bank deposits to market-linked investments.Colonial First State joins Challenger Financial Services Group Ltd , Perpetual Ltd, AXA Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd, Australian Unity, MacarthurCook Ltd, ING, and APN Funds Management in freezing redemptions from mortgage funds.The future market shares of big funds managers could be extraordinarily different from where they stand today, depending upon their response to the global financial crisis, Mr Morris said.'Investors in our funds do have long memories.'When I worked at BT in the 1990s we were the dominant player in funds management by a long way.'One of the challenges that damaged our brand was the lack of liquidity we had in a number of our funds in the late 1990s.''That is a lesson we learned along with Westpac very, very well.'BT chief financial officer Earle Macgregor said BT had a defensive position against further falls on the local sharemarket.A 10 per cent decline in total funds under management, resulting from a 15 to 20 per cent drop in the All Ordinaries in dex from current levels, would see BT take a $7 million hit to its cash net profit, he said.The company has declared a final dividend of 5.4 cents per share, fully franked.At 1236 AEDT, BT shares were down nine cents to $2.49.(AAP)More News:  Market Updates   Stock Alerts   All Trading News   Stock Index
