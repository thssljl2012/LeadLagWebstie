ing to pay off home loans, the threat of a severe recession has never looked so good.Thanks to growing fears that we are about to be caught up in a worldwide economic slump, the Reserve Bank has delivered to home buyers the biggest single dose of mortgage relief since May 1992 - during Paul Keating's 'recession we had to have'. For a typical home buyer with a $300,000 mortgage, the savings resulting from yesterday's decision will be about $171 a month - roughly double what we had been led to expect.Though a useful bonus, the savings will still be more than $40 a month less than if the banks had fully passed on the 1 percentage point cut in the Reserve Bank's official cash rate.Shocked by the size of the RBA cut, some banks took several hours to respond.Ending weeks of political jaw-wagging and speculation over how much of the cut the banks should keep, Westpac jumped first, announcing it would slice 0.8 percentage points from its standard variable home loan.That set a bar for others to meet, and each in its turn stepped up with a 0.8 percentage point cut - first Commonwealth Bank, then National Australia Bank, ANZ and St George.NAB chief economist Alan Oster predicted interest rates would be lowered by a further percentage point over the next five months - taking the cash rate to 5% - with the first instalment of half a percentage point next month.Ross McEwan, head of retail banking at Commonwealth, said the bank had cut 'as much as possible' and promised that, when the financial turmoil ended, the bank would 'reduce rates by more than the RBA adjustments'. He also promised to cut rates without cues from the RBA.The promise of cuts outside the RBA cycle was a step further than the other banks were willing to go, though each issued statements stoking hopes of lower rates to come.To the end, Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull argued the banks were profitable enough to pass on the entire cut.
