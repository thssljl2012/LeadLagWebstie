Can it do that again?'That is certainly what we are aiming for, and there is nothing in the data to date to suggest that we are off track.'But the economy is being affected by powerful forces from different directions, and it is unclear what the net effect will be.'The impact of global developments is uncertain.'The deputy RBA chief said the Australian economy was likely to grow at a slower pace in the next two years.'The next couple of years will be noticeably more subdued that the past five,' he said.'We should not be surprised by this as the income and wealth generated over the past five years were simply extraordinary.'By definition, the economy must grow at a below average pace for some of the time.'These periods provide the economy with the breathing space to sustain the expansion.'The Chinese economy was expected to help Australia in the long-term.'It would be naive to assume that China will not experience an economic cycle, so we should expect its demand for our resources to fluctuate,' Mr Battellino said.'However, China's strong long-term growth potential must be a source of optimism about our long-term prosperity, given our role as one of its most important suppliers of raw materials.'Mr Battellino said managing the Australian economy would be more difficult than it was in 2001 because of high inflation.Headline inflation in the year to September surged by five per cent, a level well above the RBA's two to three per cent target.'The (Reserve) Bank has for some time thought that inflation would peak in the second half of 2008 and then fall; accordingly, we have acted pre-emptively in reducing interest rates.'Mr Battellino suggested the RBA would be constrained in how low it could reduce interest rates in light of the high inflation.'Nonetheless, there is still a big task ahead to bring inflation down and this could limit room for manoeuvre on monetary policy,' he said.Have your sayYour commentFirst nameLast nameEmail(not published)Remember meEmail me if comment is publishedTo prevent automated programs from using this form to send spam, please enter the letters you see in the image below into the appropriate input box.
