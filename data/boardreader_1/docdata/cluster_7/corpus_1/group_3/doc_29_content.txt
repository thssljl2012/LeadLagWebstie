THE global credit crisis is receiving a lot of coverage, but how will it affect an owner of a small to medium private business?The situation is a serious risk to businesses of all sizes around the world. But like any risk it needs to be identified, quantified and managed. The main impacts are twofold: it severely affects investor and consumer confidence, and it will have a more direct financial impact on how much customers will spend on products or services - it will curb business revenues. The availability and cost of finance is also of concern.Although there is talk of the Reserve Bank of Australia reducing interest rates, this may not be enough to overcome the fact that funds are becoming scarcer, which alters the way Australian banks allocate or lend their funds and price interest rates.The weakening Australian dollar will also increase the cost of imported products.This means businesses may be in for a triple whammy, with revenues falling, cost of purchases and other inputs increasing along with the cost of funding.Given the level of uncertainty, now is the time to model the impacts of these events on your business to help you plan for possible economic scenarios, so that if they do occur you can react quickly.When modelling you should prepare a forecast profit and loss statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet, then test scenarios such as: what if my sales fall by 15 per cent? or what if the cost of goods sold increase by 10 per cent?What will the impact be on the business's ability to generate profit and cash? How much stock will be left? Will these events cause the business to breach its borrowing covenants with the bank?Modelling such potential outcomes will identify the risks and allow you to quantify their potential impact on the business and determine strategies to manage them, or even prevent them from occurring.This type of modelling is also a firm foundation for a rational conversation with your investors and bankers before panic sets in.Dominic Pelligana is a partner at KPMG Middle Market Advisory.
