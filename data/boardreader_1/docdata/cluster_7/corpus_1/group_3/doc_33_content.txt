The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut the cash interest rate by a massive 100 basis points, to 6 per cent, raising expectations that New Zealand's Reserve Bank will follow suit, possibly within days.The surprise move by the Australian central bank was bigger than the 50 basis point fall that economists had predicted.The news sparked a big turnaround in the Australian sharemarket, which opened more than 3 per cent lower yesterday after stocks were savaged on Wall Street overnight.By the close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 1.7 per cent. The Australian rate cut also pushed up the New Zealand dollar from a two-year low earlier in the day. The Kiwi ended the day just above US63c, recovering US1c or so after the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed interest rates.It is the first 100 basis point cut to the cash rate since May 6, 1992, when the Australian central bank lowered the cash rate to 6.50 per cent.Bank governor Glenn Stevens said the bank had judged that a large movement in the cash rate was needed, after studying the outlook for global growth and its likely effect on Australia, and funding costs in wholesale credit markets.'Given that background, the board judged that a material change to the balance of risks surrounding the outlook had occurred, requiring a significantly less restrictive stance of monetary policy,' he said.ANZ bank chief economist Cameron Bagrie said the Reserve Bank could cut its official cash rate by the same amount as Australia, from the current 7.5 per cent, in coming days.'It's going to be a case of riding in Kanga's pouch. I think we're going to see 100 basis points by the end of the month here as well in New Zealand,' Mr Bagrie said.'The story here is the environment has changed so much that [the feeling is] don't dilly-dally around ... I wouldn't rule out a move in the next 48 hours.'New Zealand's currency tumbled earlier yesterday as panic gripped markets. Stocks plunged as investors retreated to safe-haven assets, including the US dollar.Steep falls in equity markets around the world, with European markets down by 7 per cent to 9 per cent on Monday, prompted investors to reduce their exposure to riskier bets like the Kiwi.It closed at US63.35c, recovering from a low of US61.70c, its lowest since early August 2006.-with AAPNext Story: 'No doubt' about a NZ bank bailout
