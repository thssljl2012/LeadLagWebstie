SUNCORP-METWAY yesterday became the first big domestic financial services group to warn that it could be forced to cut its dividend as a direct consequence of the global credit crisis - the impact of which may still lead to the sale of its banking division.Having confirmed in August that it was looking to hold its latest full-year payout of $1.07 a share into next year, the troubled bancassurer alerted shareholders it might have to rethink that promise.Suncorp's chairman, John Story, who faced a barrage of questions from investors at the company's annual general meeting in Brisbane about the company's falling value, emphasised that no decision to reduce the next two half-yearly payments had been made.But given the financial pressures on the group and, in particular, the high cost of funding within its banking arm caused by the liquidity crunch, Mr Story said it was only sensible for Suncorp to preserve as much capital as possible. 'In what are extraordinary times the board believes it should adopt a conservative and prudent approach to the way it manages the capital position so as to have appropriate buffers to better withstand a variety of exceptional scenarios,' he told about 1000 shareholders.Such financial discipline also applied to Suncorp's decision to consider offers for its core banking operation even though the group had not sought to sell the division, he said. The group received three approaches to buy the bank, of which ANZ submitted the only formal offer of $2 billion-plus.Dismayed by the size of the bid, Suncorp was already close to rejecting ANZ's overtures when the Federal Government put in place its deposit and wholesale funding guarantee that immediately eased the pressures on the group to sell.Mr Story refused to identify the interested parties or the actual bidder at yesterday's meeting, citing confidentiality agreements, despite calls from shareholders to do so.But while stating that Suncorp wished to hold onto the bank, Mr Story said the group would still listen to offers for it and sell it if the price was good enough.In the meantime, the group said it would reduce the size of the banking operations in an effort to cut costs over the coming year.Mr Story was also forced to defend his board and management team, led by John Mulcahy, after shareholders criticised bonus payments that were made in 2007-08 despite an almost 50 per cent drop in profits and a plunging share price that has more than halved in value since May.Suncorp's shares yesterday slipped another 45c to $7.50.
