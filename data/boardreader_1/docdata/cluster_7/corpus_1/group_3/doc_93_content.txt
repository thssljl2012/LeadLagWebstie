SYDNEY, Oct 7 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank, the country's largest lender, on Tuesday cut its standard variable home loan rate by 0.80 percentage point to 8.56 percent annually, following similar moves by its main competitors. Earlier Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut the official cash rate by a surprisingly large 1 percent to 6.0 percent. Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, Australia's fourth-largest bank, and Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd have also said they would reduce standard variable home loan rates by 80 basis points following the reserve bank's decision.
