AUSTRALIA has produced its biggest monthly trade surplus in 11 years, in a sign that exports will continue to underpin the economy even as consumer spending slows, economists say.The Australian balance of goods and services was a surplus of $1.36 billion, seasonally adjusted, in August, Australian Bureau of Statistics data out today showed.This was the largest monthly trade surplus since June 1997, which was the biggest ever, and was significantly above market forecasts for a $200 million trade surplus for August.The July figure was revised to a $697 million deficit.During the month, exports rose 6 per cent in adjusted terms, while imports were down 2 per cent.A big mover was a 26 per cent surge in coal exports to $4.511 billion.Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior economist Michael Workman said increases in coal and iron ore volumes boosted exports while a slowdown in domestic consumer spending caused imports to fall.Net exports were expected to underpin Australia's gross domestic product growth (GDP) in the year ahead.'The net exports are likely to be a big contributor to growth over the next year after being a negative for five years,'' he said.'It's a significant change in Australia's growth structures, and with the business investment and capital investment side, is likely to be quite strong.''Mr Workman said Australia was likely to post more monthly billion dollar trade surpluses in the year ahead.'The surplus was a lot higher than expected: it's pretty indicative of what's coming up on the trade side over the next year,'' he said.'It looks like there's more (export) growth - possibly 5 to 10 per cent over the next five to six months.''ANZ economist Alex Joiner said a weaker Australian dollar, now trading under US80c, would support further trade surpluses in coming months.''(This is) helping to offset a slowdown in global demand for exports and deterring import growth,'' he said.'Further, in an environment of strong demand for resources the weaker Australian dollar means higher revenues for mining exports, as commodities are priced in US dollars.''Mr Joiner said Australia's trade balance would be at risk in 2009, when the global economy weakened.'At least we have entered the current period of turbulence in relatively good shape,'' he said.Australia's dramatic trade balance improvement was led by a 9.7 per cent jump in the value of resource exports, with both prices and coal volumes spiking higher, Mr Joiner said.Rural exports climbed 3.6 per cent while manufacturing exports rose 5.1 per cent.On the imports side, intermediate goods fell 7.3 per cent while demand for consumption goods dropped one per cent, reflecting the slowdown in domestic spending.Mr Joiner said a 24.5 per cent fall in fuel imports also weighed down overall imports.ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies said the trade surplus reflected recent increases in prices for exports arising from the mining sector.'The turnaround in the trade balance is showing that the recent surge in coal and iron prices is coming through in the numbers,'' Mr Davies said.'It should produce a sharp narrowing in the current account deficit, although it will still be large because the cost of servicing our foreign debt is so big at the moment.''Mr Davies said the declining world oil price helped imports of fuels fall by $887 million, or 25 per cent, seasonally adjusted.'We are a net importer of oil nowadays so the fall in the world price of oil has helped us out,'' Mr Davies said.But he said some of the benefits of a falling oil price was cancelled out by the weaker Australian dollar.Mr Davies said there were limited implications for the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) monthly board meeting next week.'I think they (the RBA) would have always assumed that we would see this turnaround, given what's happened to coal and iron prices,'' Mr Davies said.'I don't think it is anything new for them.''Mr Davies said he expected the RBA to cut the cash rate by 50 basis points next week.'I think the biggest issue for them is trying to gauge what's happening in world financial markets and the fallout for Australia,'' he said.
