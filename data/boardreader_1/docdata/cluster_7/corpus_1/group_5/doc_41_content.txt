SYDNEY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Australian employment fell in November while the jobless rate ticked higher in what is expected to be just the start of a protracted period of weakness for the once-robust labour market. Leading indicators such as job advertisements and business surveys have shown stark weakness in the last few months pointing to a sizable rise in unemployment in the months ahead. Still, the drop in jobs in November was not as large as many investors had bet on and a rise in full-time jobs suggested the labour market may not deteriorate as rapidly as feared. ************************************************************* KEY POINTS: - Nov employment -15,600 mth/mth, seasonally adjusted (Reuters poll: -15,000) - Nov full-time employment +8,800, part-time -24,400 - Nov unemployment rate 4.4 percent, seasonally adjusted (forecast 4.5 pct) - Nov participation rate 65.1 percent, seasonally adjusted (forecast 65.2 pct) - For a brief data table click on COMMENTARY: SU-LIN ONG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS 'It confirms the weakening in the labour market, but the deterioration is fairly modest at this juncture, I think the market is braced for worse than this. What's worrying is the leading indicators portend to a much weaker labour market going forward than what today's numbers would suggest.' WARREN HOGAN, HEAD OF AUSTRALIAN ECONOMICS, ANZ 'The only surprise was the strength of the survey was in full-time employment, with a big decline in part time, which seems to be counter-intuitive. This isn't capturing the turn in the labour market. It does suggest we are obviously entering a period of weaker labour demand. But all up, it was pretty much as expected. It lends itself to the case that unemployment is going to move up gradually rather than quickly.' MICHAEL BLYTHE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CBA 'It looks like the economic slowdown has caught up with the labour market and unfortunately we are going to have to get used to these negative numbers over the coming months...It's a fairly modest deterioration all things considered and the unemployment rate is, by any long-term comparison, still extremely low. I think it's not enough to see the Reserve Bank rushing back in January to have another go (at cutting rates).' MARKET REACTION: The Australian dollar blipped higher as the jobs data were not as dire as some bears had been betting on. Likewise, bill futures trimmed gains as the data did not add to already aggressive expectations of more rate cuts.
