Housing finance in Australia rose 1.3 percent in October, in line with market forecast for a 1.5 percent increase, a tentative sign aggressive cuts in interest rates are helping to support demand for homes. --------------------------------------------------------------- * The Australian dollar was subdued below the week's high of $0.6691 on Wednesday as fears of a deepening global recession outweighed better-than-expected domestic economic data, and modestly higher shares and commodity prices. * The Aussie was subdued against the yen as well, trading at 60.92 yen compared to 60.94 yen in late afternoon trade here on Tuesday. * In new signs the global economic outlook is deteriorating, Japan's core machinery orders fell a bigger-than-expected 4.4 percent in October, as the economy slides deeper into recession. Japan is Australia's second-largest trading partner after China. * Britain's economy shrank by a full percentage point in the three months to November and the pace of contraction looks set to accelerate, a leading think-tank said. * U.S. crude futures edged up to stay above $42 a barrel on Wednesday, ahead of U.S. government data expected to show a fall in U.S. distillate and gasoline inventories. Gold prices inched up as well as the dollar steadied against the yen. * Investors' jitters about the worsening economic outlook is underlined by the clamour for safe-haven assets that drove rates on three-month Treasury bills below zero percent. * Australian bonds were mixed as three-year bonds rose on expectations Australia's central bank will cut interest rates by at least 1 percentage point by March. * Three-year Australian bond futures added 0.055 points to 96.515, while the 10-year contract fell 0.025 points to 95.665.
