International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned on Thursday that the financial crisis would worsen in 2009 and affect the whole world, during a visit to Costa Rica.  'I want to tell you that 2008 was a difficult year in the world economy but in no way can we expect 2009 to be better,' the IMF managing director said during a joint news conference with President Oscar Arias.  'This is true anywhere, all around the world, in the United States, in Europe. The IMF is expecting negative growth next year.'  The financial meltdown has eroded economic growth and thrown the US and other major economies into recession.  Strauss-Kahn again urged governments Wednesday in Jamaica to use spending, rather than interest rate cuts, to battle the global financial crisis.   2008 AFP  When news happens:send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us.  10:09AM Watch what you eat, says PM  10:07AM EU leaders reach agreement on rescue package: Berlusconi  10:07AM Home  National   World   Opinion   Business   Technology   Sport   Entertainment  CLASSIFIEDSJobs   Real Estate   Cars   Dating   Place a classified ad  Sitemap  Subscribe   Privacy   Contact Us   Conditions   Member Agreement    Copyright  2008.
