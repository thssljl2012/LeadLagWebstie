THE dollar has opened weaker as the US government's multi-billion package for its car industry boosted support for the American currency.  At 07.00pm (AEDT), the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6832/37, down from Friday's close of $US0.6858/65.  During the overnight session, the local unit traded between $US0.6767 and $US0.6921.  The US government's $US17.4 billion ($A25.46 billion) in emergency loans to American car makers allayed concerns of an industy collapse.  Two of the big Detroit carmarkers, General Motors and Chrysler, are expected to seek access to the money immediately.  Commonwealth Bank manager of institutional services foreign exchange, Tim Kelleher, said the US dollar rose after the announcement of the bail-out package for the American car industry. 'There was some Aussie/yen buying on the back of the automakers package going through,'' he said. 'Traders bought US dollar/yen and the Aussie/Yen went up a bit on the back of it.''  The US dollar rallied against the yen, after the Japanese central bank cut its key interest rate to 0.1 per cent, from 0.3 per cent on Friday afternoon.  Mr Kelleher said recent movements on foreign exchange markets had been exaggerated by low trading volumes. 'It was pretty volatile with wide ranges and thin markets,'' he said. 'The currencies are quite thin in volume, so it is not taking as much to move them.' Mr Kelleher said the Australian dollar should trade between $US0.6775 and $US0.6875 during the Asian session. 'It should be a quieter day leading into Christmas,'' he said.
