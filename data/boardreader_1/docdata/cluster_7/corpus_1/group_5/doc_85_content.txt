The Hon Julie Bishop MP  Shadow Treasurer  Deputy Leader of the Opposition  The Coalition welcomes Westpac's announcement today that they are cutting interest rates on their credit card products and encourages all credit card providers to follow Westpac's lead.  Lower interest rates on credit cards will give many Australians the chance to pay off their credit card debt and may enable some to not only pay off their debt but to have additional money left over to spend on goods and services.  I am concerned that with interest rates on credit cards still at very high levels, many Australians are experiencing difficulty repaying the debt on their credit cards, particularly low income earners who may be suffering serious hardship in trying to pay their bills.  If people pay lower interest rates on their credit card, they will have more money to spend over the longer term.  Following the announcement last week by the Reserve Bank of a further 100 basis point cut to the official cash rate the Coalition called on Australia's banks to immediately pass on the cut in full to credit cards, home loans and small business loans.  While today's announcement by Westpac offers some welcome relief for Westpac customers, other credit card providers should follow Westpac's lead and cut the interest rates on their credit card products.
