But Treasuries also gained as the Fed is likely to give some indication of how it will guide policy beyond interest rates, helping drive the benchmark 10-year yield back near a 54-year low hit last week.  European shares were set for a mildly positive start as markets also awaited quarterly earnings from U.S. bank Goldman, which is expected to post its first quarterly loss since going public in 1999 in a sign of the severe market conditions still slamming the financial sector.  Asian shares were mixed, with Japan's Nikkei average falling 1.1 percent as the yen's strength against the dollar hurting shares of exporters.  But the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan edged up 0.4 percent, but is still down about 54 percent so far this year. Continued...
