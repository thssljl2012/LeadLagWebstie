The chairman of St George Bank Ltd, John Curtis, has reiterated that shareholders should accept the $17.3 billion takeover offer by Westpac Banking Corporation, which was improved last week by the addition of a special dividend payment.The board of St George, Australia's fifth biggest bank by market capitalisation, had always considered Westpac's proposal to be compelling and is in shareholders' best interest, in the absence of a superior proposal, Mr Curtis said in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday.Westpac, Australia's second biggest bank by market cap, said on September 8 it had agreed that St George pay shareholders up to $1.25 per share in final and special dividends.The addition of the special dividend represented an increase of up to 28 cents in payments, which will be announced when Sydney-based St George reports its full-year results on October 29. 'This recognises the loyalty of St George shareholders to the bank in the context of the merger proposal,' Mr Curtis said in the statement. 'It is proposed to be paid in conjunction with a package of measures designed to increase the likelihood of completion of the merger transaction and accelerate the benefits of the merger.' St George shareholders will still be paid 1.31 Westpac shares for each St George share they own, under the revised proposal, which will create Australia's biggest bank, overtaking Commonwealth Bank of Australia.The offer values each St George share at $30.47.St George shares fell 24 cents, or 0.79 per cent, to close at $30.10 and Westpac rose 11 cents to $23.26 on a day the rest of the market slumped after US investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. The S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 fell 1.39 per cent.Under the proposal, St George is liable to pay Westpac a break fee of $100 million under certain circumstances, including a change in the board's unanimous recommendation.St George shareholders will vote on the takeover at a scheme meeting on November 13.The takeover will add to earnings within three years of the merger, Sydney-based Westpac has said.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said it won't oppose the merger, which will also need approval from the Treasurer Wayne Swan, Mr Curtis said.
