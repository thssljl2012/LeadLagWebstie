But Aurora Loan Services was forced to stop originating those loans several months ago because 'the investor base stopped buying' as the market dried up, said Peter Lansing, head of Denver-based mortgage banker Universal Lending.Aurora Loan significantly scaled back its business earlier this year, cutting roughly 1,300 jobs, or half its work force. Lehman said it would consolidate those Colorado operations in Littleton and close centers in California, Florida and New Jersey.Company officials have declined to comment, and it remains unclear what will happen to the Littleton office or the remaining employees.Lansing said he receives at least one resume a week from former Aurora Loan Services employees in search of a job.'They were a huge employer in the Colorado mortgage industry and were doing business across the whole country,' he said.Aurora Loan Services has filed several lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Denver over the past year and a half, claiming that companies from which it purchased mortgage loans breached the terms of their contracts.After the bankruptcy filing, British bank Barclays agreed to a $1.75 billion deal to purchase Lehman Brothers' core U.S. business.
