The Reserve Bank of Australia has continued to pump extra cash into the local money market to ease the credit squeeze. It added $2 billion today in repurchase agreements to make it easier for local banks to lend to each other. Bank deposits with the RBA stand at a record $10.6 billion as institutions hoard cash. The central bank is also preparing to lend more US dollars as the global financial crisis deepens.
