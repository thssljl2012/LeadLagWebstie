NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The financial earthquake that shook Wall Street last week may be followed by a $900 billion aftershock as bank debt comes due in the next year.U.S. and European banks face soaring premiums as a mountain of debt matures at a time when the primary market remains frozen. As much as 150 billion euros billion in euro-denominated debt is due in the next six months, according to Barclays Capital, and $673 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated financial debt is set to mature through the end of 2009, based on Morgan Stanley data.That means banks, already suffering from the worst credit conditions since the Great Depression, will be forced to re-issue bonds at a steep price to roll over borrowings and raise fresh capital or seek other options including reduced loan growth.'Either they will have to pay up to get it done or they will have to do other things, like asset sales, which is also difficult,' said Olivia Frieser, a bank credit analyst at BNP Paribas, in London.In Europe, there is cash to be put to work and investors are expecting hefty discounts on senior debt. A UBS (UBSN.VX: Quote, Profile, Research)(UBS.N: Quote, Profile, Research) five-year 1.75-billion-euro bond was launched at the end of August, for example, at a 19-basis-point premium over secondary spreads and 125 basis points over its credit default swaps.'We're underweight on the financial side, but senior paper is one area we would be looking into in the medium term,' said Christian Doppstadt, head of corporate credit investment at WestLB Asset Management, in Dusseldorf, Germany.CRUNCH TIMEWall Street's landscape changed dramatically last week with the U.S. government's $85 billion loan for AIG, once the world's largest insurer based on market value; the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc (LEH.N: Quote, Profile, Research)(LEHMQ.PK: Quote, Profile, Research), the parent of the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, and the fire sale of Merrill Lynch (MER.N: Quote, Profile, Research), the largest U.S. retail brokerage, to Bank of America (BAC.N: Quote, Profile, Research).
