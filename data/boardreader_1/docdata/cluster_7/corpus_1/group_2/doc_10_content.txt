Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd expects to continue growing revenue while eyeing the impact of 'seriously challenged' financial markets on Australian households.Bendigo's most profitable unit, its retail business, will enjoy continued revenue growth after the regional bank applied tighter lending standards and cost controls during 2007/08, the bank said.But significant short term profit growth will remain elusive given wholesale funding pressures that has seen Bendigo's funding become more difficult to obtain and more expensive.'We have been able to fund all profitable activities and businesses in our group and have not needed to make large provisions against doubtful loans,' the bank said in its annual report released late Wednesday.'Financial markets remain uneasy, economic growth has slowed, confidence levels have deteriorated, and our businesses previously benefitting from the fund emanating from wholesale markets still face further challenges.'Australia has one of the best banking systems in the world, the bank added.Bendigo funds 70 per cent of its loans from retail deposits - a higher proportion than Australia's big four banks.Intense competition for retail deposits will continue among Australia's banks and attention will shift from traditional asset growth to capital management requirements, Bendigo predicts.After four interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia during 2007/08, along with spiralling fuel and energy costs, the bank is keeping the household and business sector on watch.Meanwhile, the bank's merger with Adelaide Bank is on target, with around one-third of the forecast merger synergies already delivered by June 30, 2008 resulting in a $20 million reduction in the bank's cost base run rate.The bank is 'well advanced' in reshaping and integrating Adelaide Bank's retail network into Bendigo's network, the bank said.Shares in Bendigo firmed 3.5 per cent, or 44 cents, to $12.93.
