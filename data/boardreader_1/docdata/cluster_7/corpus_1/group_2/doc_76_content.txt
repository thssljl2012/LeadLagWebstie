The proposed merger of Westpac Banking and St George Bank in Australia is being advocated by Macquarie Equities. The firm argues in a new research brief that the move has the potential to create cost efficiencies valued at $A400m per year from 2013, and to liberate some $A2bn in capital by mid-2011. The expected boost to earnings per share at Westpac is now also believed to be achievable much earlier, after just little over a year. Macquarie likes the fact as well that under the latest merger terms being negotiated, St George will not need to fund a special dividend. The analysts have a rating of 'outperform' on the Westpac stockDistributed by News Bites.
