COMMONWEALTH Bank has been singled out as the most likely entity to pursue an acquisition of Suncorp's banking operations, possibly paying about $4 billion.Since August 22, shares in the Queensland-based Suncorp have nosedived, hitting a near eight-year low of $8.35 at one point during the market turmoil last week, The Australian reported.The stock bounced back this week, yesterday closing up 50c at $10.01.A big factor in the fall has been investor unease about Suncorp's funding position, particularly because of its single A rating, and property development exposure.There is market speculation that QBE Insurance, which has made no secret of its interest in Suncorp, and the Commonwealth Bank may be having a hard look at the bancassurance company.In a note to clients yesterday, Deutsche bank looked at the prospect of Suncorp taking corporate action to unlock shareholder value and consider the 'downside from a likely deterioration in most metrics in the bank, should the sale of the bank not eventuate'. 'The value in Suncorp has been apparent for some time,' Deutsche analysts wrote. 'Strip general insurance and wealth management out of the current market cap and it implies the bank is trading at 5.1 times earnings, a 50 per cent discount to the major banks.' Conversely, after stripping the bank out at a 20 per cent discount to the majors, it implied Suncorp's insurance arm was trading at a 30 per cent discount to rival IAG, it added.Out of five options canvassed, including a full takeover in a joint bid, the analysts said the most likely action was the sale of the banking operations.CBA, which is said to be circling Perth-based BankWest, is seen as the mostly likely predator at a price of about $4 billion. 'Our analysis suggests that CBA could pay around $4 billion for Suncorp's bank, with a broadly earnings-per-share neutral outcome in year one and a 3 per cent accretion by year three,' Deutsche said. National Australia Bank and ANZ were also cited as possible contenders.  The Australian.
