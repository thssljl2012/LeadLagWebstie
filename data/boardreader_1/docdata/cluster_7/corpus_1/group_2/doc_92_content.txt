Australian consumers may have entered a new era of fiscal conservatism as credit card debt levels grew at their slowest annual pace in 14 years, new data shows.While the total value of credit and charge card transactions, including advances, rose by 3.5 per cent in July, the overall balances owing fell marginally, Reserve Bank of Australia figures today showed.Australians increased their credit card repayments by 7.1 per cent in July.Commsec chief equities economist Craig James said the latest credit data was more confirmation of a new era of consumer conservatism.'The growth in the average credit card balance is at its lowest rate in 14 years,'' Mr James said.'High interest rates, high petrol prices, have helped keep Australians check their spending and check their budgets.''Average credit card balances fell marginally, by $10 to $3,138, in the year to July.The average balance on credit cards rose 4.6 per cent in the past year, the slowest rate since records began 14 years ago, Mr James said.Mr James said consumers were keeping a rein on their credit cards, particularly in the tighter financial environment.'People are using their cards but keeping their balances under control,' Mr James said.'The value of transactions rose by four per cent in the latest month (July) but cardholders put their (July 1) tax cuts to work by lifting repayments by over seven per cent.'Cash advances, where the consumer is hit with interest once they withdraw the money, fell by 3.5 per cent in value in the month.'The number of credit card cash advances in July was down 6.9 per cent on a year ago, making 15 consecutive months of annual declines,'' Mr James said.The RBA governor Glenn Stevens noted yesterday the central bank sensed Australian consumers were starting a new era with their spending, Mr James said.RBA governor Glenn Stevens said growth in household credit was at a much slower pace than it had been for some years.'But there is also a good chance that households will for some time seek to contain and consolidate their debt, grow their consumption spending at a pace closer to income,' he said.'Perhaps look to save more of their current income than in the recent past.'It is possible that we are witnessing the early part of a new phase where the household spending and borrowing dynamic is different from the past decade and a half.''
