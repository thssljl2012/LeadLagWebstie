ANZ's decision to slash hundreds of middle-level management jobs takes a short-term view, the financial union says.Finance Sector Union national secretary Leon Carter said the job cuts continued the trend of restructuring in the sector which resulted in the loss of experienced workers. 'Unfortunately, whenever bank workers, ANZ workers included, hear the word 'restructure', they get very, very nervous and that's from very bitter experience because they know what a restructure means, it means less jobs,'' Mr Carter said today. 'We cannot continue a process where experienced bank workers, their skills and the years of work get wasted away by restructure after restructure. 'If this bank wants to be a major regional player, if the whole country wants to be a regional hub for Asia in finance, ... then it must take a long-term view. 'And that requires retaining and investing in Australian jobs, not a short-term mentality that involves slashing and burning every time there is an announcement about a share price.'' ANZ chief executive Mike Smith announced yesterday a business model and organisational restructure, which is expected to result in the loss of several hundred jobs, in ANZ's effort to become a super regional bank. The bank will base itself around its three geographic regions - Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific. The overhaul is expected to be completed by January.
