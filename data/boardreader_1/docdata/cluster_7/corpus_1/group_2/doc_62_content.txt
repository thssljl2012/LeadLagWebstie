 New York (PTI): The hope that the USD 85 billion bailout of American Insurance Group (AIG) would help stabilise the US markets were belied as the investors continued to flee the Wall Street, sending the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial average to its lowest level in almost three years.The Dow on Wednesday fell by 449.36 points to 10,609.66 after a 500-point decline on Monday. It has lost 800 points or 7.1 per cent of the value this week alone and even after the markets closed, fears of other major financial institutions failing continued to dog the investors.The Standard and Poor's 500 stock index was down by 4.7 per cent to 1156.39 and technology stock heavy Nasdaq fell 4.9 per cent to 2098.85. For Standard and Poor's, it was lowest level since May 2005 and for Nasdaq since August 2006.Among other factors, the fears were fed by media reports late in the evening that Morgan Stanley had entered into merger talks with Wachovia and other banks as its share declined for seventh straight day, losing 24 per cent at USD 21.75 yesterday, the lowest level since 1998.Goldman Sachs, the largest investment bank by market value, also saw its share decline sharply by 14 per cent to USD 114.50 and analysts said the question being asked is which institution would go down next.As turmoil in financial markets continued, investors sought safe haven in gold, a traditional refuge during troubled time, sending its price up by USD 70 an ounce and government notes even though the yield was almost negligible.The crisis, which began 13 months ago, is now taking increasing toll and the last two weeks have seen government taking over quasi-public mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae, bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, sale of Merrill Lynch and costly rescue of AIG.Analysts saw a subtle shift in the tone of the White House after George W Bush's 'fundamentals of the economy are strong' statement. 'The economy has strength to be able to deal with the shocks,' it said.The New York Times reported that mutual fund investors have been pulling the money out of American and global equity funds throughout the year but the pace has quickened.Customers pulled almost USD 11 billion out of all equity funds on Monday, about USD 7 billion from the United States and USD 4 billion form global funds, it said quoting Charles Biderman of TrimTabs, a research firm that tracks the funds.The firm says that in the first 10 business days of this month, American funds have been hit by redemption demands totaling USD 13 billion while global funds have handed back USD 12.6 billion, representing the 'dismal performance of global funds in the last six weeks.'Still, the firms says that these withdrawals represent tiny fraction of overall assets and Biderman is quoted as saying that he believes a wave of panicky selling 'is symptomatic of what occurs at market bottoms.'The Wall Street Journal said Fed and Treasury officials have identified the disease. It's called deleveraging, or the unwinding of debt.During the credit boom, it explained, financial institutions and American households took on too much debt. Between 2002 and 2006, household borrowing grew at an average annual rate of 11 per cent, far outpacing overall economic growth. Borrowing by financial institutions grew by a 10 per cent annualised rate.Now many of those borrowers cannot pay back the loans, a problem that is exacerbated by the collapse in housing prices. They need to reduce their dependence on borrowed money, a painful and drawn-out process that can choke off credit and economic growth, it said.At least three things, it added, need to happen to bring the deleveraging process to an end, and they're hard to do at once. Financial institutions and others need to fess up to their mistakes by selling or writing down the value of distressed assets they bought with borrowed money. They need to pay off debt. Finally, they need to rebuild their capital cushions, which have been eroded by losses on those distressed assets.
