 jobs have been safeguarded at struggling footwear chain Faith Shoes after the group was bought in a rescue deal led by retail entrepreneur John Kinnaird.Mr Kinnaird, former owner of Dolcis Shoes, has teamed up with investment fund Agilo to buy Faith from administrators for an undisclosed sum.The deal will see the Faith brand saved after its future was left hanging in the balance when previous owners, private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital, were reportedly forced to put the business up for auction after failing to reach agreement with its bank, Barclays.Faith, which has 85 stores and more than 120 concessions across the UK, will now be merged with Mr Kinnairds existing clothing brand Envy and Agilos teenage fashion business Chilli Pepper to create a new high street presence.The new business will have around 140 stores across the UK, as well as more than 200 concessions in the UK and Europe.It is understood that department store partners include House of Fraser, Debenhams and major Paris store Galeries Lafayette.Faith was placed in administration yesterday afternoon before being sold on in a so-called pre-pack deal. Mr Kinnaird and management now hold a majority stake in the new business, with Barclays Bank and Agilo holding minority shares and also providing working capital facilities.Administrators FTI Consulting said: This transaction will enable the business to continue to trade as well as securing the future of the brand which is excellent news for its employees, customers and suppliers. Faith is believed to have been put up for sale after Barclays rejected a restructuring proposal from Bridgepoint.The most recent publicly available set of accounts for Faith show that it racked up operating losses after tax of 11m in the year to June 30 2007, on sales of 89m. Bridgepoint bought the business in 2004 for 64m from Jonathan Faith, son of Samuel Faith, who founded the business in 1964.
