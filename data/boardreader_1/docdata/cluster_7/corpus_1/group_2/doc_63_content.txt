Fitch Ratings has today placed HBOS' long-term issuer default rating of AA and Lloyds TSB's long-term IDR of AA+ on rating watch negative. The rating actions follow the announcement that Lloyds TSB is to purchase HBOS in an all-share transaction valued at GBP12.2bn, based on a Lloyds TSB share price of 279.75p. Fitch considers Lloyds TSB, the smaller party in the merger in terms of consolidated assets, to be a very conservatively-managed bank that has been relatively unaffected by the credit crisis. Fitch stated: "While the equity-funded nature of the transaction is supportive of current ratings, the rating watch in respect of Lloyds TSB reflects Fitch's concerns over the potential impact on the group's credit profile of owning lower-rated HBOS. "HBOS' existing ratings reflect its high exposure to the deteriorating UK property market and relatively greater reliance on the stressed wholesale funding markets to finance its customer lending. The rating watch in respect of Lloyds TSB also reflects the integration risks in undertaking such a substantial transaction at a time of extraordinary financial market turbulence. "The rating actions in respect of HBOS reflect primarily the execution risk of such a substantial transaction in volatile and unpredictable markets. "There is clearly strong political will within the UK to support the acquisition, but the transaction is not expected to close until late 2008 or early 2009.' Fitch said it expects to resolve the rating watches upon completion of the acquisition which, if successful, is anticipated late this year or early in 2009.
