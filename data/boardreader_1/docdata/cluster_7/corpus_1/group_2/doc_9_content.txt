ANZ Bank chief executive Mike Smith says Australian banks are looking very strong, despite the current financial market turmoil.'The thing about the Australian banks is that they will come through this crisis extremely well,'' he said. 'They are looking very strong.''Mr Smith, who was speaking at an Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce (AICC) lunch in Sydney, said the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had been ahead of game in dealing with the ramifications of the crisis, which began in the US.He said others could learn from what the central bank had done.In its financial stability review released today, the RBA gave the local banking industry a tick of approval and said it welcomed the 'unprecedented'' actions by US authorities to preserve financial stability and ease pressures in global credit markets.Asked by a member of the AICC audience if customers' money in the banks was safe, Mr Smith said: 'Of course. They (Australian banks) are among the safest in the world. They are some of the best banks in the world.''Mr Smith also said recent consolidation amongst global banks would leave Australian banks as the minnow of the industry.Australian banks would have to seek acquisitions overseas given the federal government's four pillars policy, which prevents the big four banks from merging with each other.
