The cause and impact of America's - and the world's - credit crisis are receiving a lot of coverage. But what does it mean to an owner of a small to medium private business?This is an obvious major risk to the global and Australian economies, and businesses of all sizes. But like any risk it needs to be identified, quantified and managed.The major impacts of the current economic climate are twofold; one, it severely impacts investor and consumer confidence and secondly it will have a more direct financial impact on how much customers will spend on your products or services - it will affect business revenues.The availability and cost of finance is also concerning.While there is talk of the Reserve Bank of Australia reducing interest rates domestically this may not be enough to overcome the fact that funds are becoming scarcer, impacting the way Australian banks allocate or lend their funds and price interest rates.The decreasing Australian dollar will also increase the cost of imported products.This means businesses may be in for a 'triple whammy' with revenues declining, cost of purchases and other inputs increasing and cost of funding increasing.Given the level of uncertainty now, more than ever, is the time to model the impacts of these events on your business to help you plan for various possible economic scenarios, then if or when they do occur, you can react quickly.When modelling, you should be preparing a forecast profit and loss statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet and then testing scenarios such as: 'what if my sales fall by 15%?', or 'what if the cost of goods sold increase by 10%?'.What will the impact be on the business's ability to generate profit and cash? How much stock will you be left with?Will these events cause the business to breach its borrowing covenants with the bank?Modelling such potential outcomes will identify the risks and allow you to quantify their potential impact on the business and determine strategies to manage them, or even prevent them from occurring.This type of modelling is also a great foundation for a rational conversation with yourinvestors and bankers before panic sets in.Dominic Pelligana is a Partner at KPMG Middle Market Advisory.
