Property and construction heavyweight Lend Lease Corporation has won the rights to construct the $560 million Darling Walk development in the Darling Harbour tourist precinct.Project management, design management and construction of the 65,000-square metre development, which is to include two-nine storey office towers, will be undertaken by subsidiaries Bovis Lend Lease and Lend Lease Development.Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial (APPF), one of Lend Lease Investment Management's wholesale property funds, will finance and acquire the project as a joint venture with one of the its existing offshore institutional partners. Lend Lease Investment Management will act as investment manager for both owners.The project includes 58,000-square metres of office space, a retail precinct, theatre, community green, water park and underground carpark.The Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority retains freehold ownership over the 1.5-hectare site on the central business district side of Darling Harbour. 'The $560 million is the end development value of the project,' Lend Lease investor relations manager Sally Cameron said. 'We will get fees relative to that, and then the construction value to Bovis probably won't be that full amount, but it will be an amount to 70 per cent or 80 per cent of the end value. 'Lend Lease Development will do the actual development management.' Commonwealth Bank of Australia has been signed as the cornerstone tenant for 13 years for the two nine-storey towers that will house 4,500 staff.Lend Lease said demolition of existing structures would begin immediately, with construction of the new precinct commencing once planning approvals were finalised in early 2009.
