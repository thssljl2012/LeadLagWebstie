It's not yet known whether the already cash-strapped NSW government will be further hit by exposure to the crumbling US financial market.The opposition has called on the government to make public details of the state's exposure, but Treasurer Eric Roozendaal offered no information.'Today we're in a position of a global financial crisis and yet for some reason (Premier) Nathan Rees and his new cabinet are completely silent,' opposition finance spokesman Mike Baird told reporters.Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser said two Queensland government organisations had $30 million tied to US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy this week.He said the state also had a potential $376 million exposure to troubled insurance company American International Group (AIG), through the Queensland Treasury Corporation.Mr Baird said the Lehman collapse had hit NSW local governments, with some councils exposed by up to $10 million.He named Wingecarribee, Gosford and Manly as the councils most susceptible but said there was a broad list of councils and did not hedge an estimate on the overall exposure.'At the moment we have no idea what exposure the state government has to some of these instruments and what that might mean to the state budget,' he said.'But importantly we also have no idea on how the councils are going to manage themselves out of this mess.'Calls to Mr Roozendaal's office today were not returned.However, possible losses could not come at a worse time for the revamped government, which has just admitted shortfalls in revenue totalling some $90 million a month.The state's budget is expected to blow out to a $1 billion deficit by the end of the financial year.Mr Rees told reporters on Tuesday the government remained committed to releasing a mini-budget in eight weeks and had not been approached by councils for assistance.'The fallout of the subprime crisis is clearly not complete,' he told reporters.'Fiscal rectitude is the order of the day.'Mr Rees said many Australian councils bought triple-A rated collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) backed by US subprime mortgages from Grange Securities, which was later bought by Lehman Brothers.Mr Baird said those investments were made based on recommendations from the state government, which should now step in to help.'Those funds have been put on good faith,' he said.'They are there to provide the playgrounds and child care centres across the state. So how are we going to protect what we've got and how are we going to move forward?'He called on the government to provide support for councils.'We would be calling for the NSW Treasury Corporation to put together a pool of experts that is available for every council in this state to talk to,' Mr Baird said.
