, 00:51 GMT  SYDNEY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Australian private sector credit and changes in financial aggregates for December, released by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Friday.  Figures are seasonally adjusted in percentage terms.  Dec Nov Dec '08/Dec'07  Total credit -0.3 +0.4 +6.7  Housing +0.4 +0.5 +7.6  Other personal use -1.1 -1.5 -5.2  Business -1.1 +0.6 +8.0  Median forecasts had been for a modest 0.5 percent rise in credit in December. The RBA said the fall in total credit reflected the drop in foreign currency denominated lending to business.  Credit growth slowed sharply last year, hitting its lowest since 1994 in November, as the global credit squeeze and crumbling household wealth led consumers and businesses to cut back on borrowing.
