Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, released today, showed housing finance for owner occupiers was up 1.4 per cent in November to $12.46 billion, on a seasonally-adjusted basis.  In October the federal government lifted the first home owners grant from $7,000 to $14,000 for established homes, and to $21,000 for newly-constructed houses.  But myriad government incentives were not enough to give confidence to the business sector.  Commercial finance plummeted 10.4 per cent to $28.4 billion, on a seasonally-adjusted basis.  Australians' appetite for personal credit also eased, down 1.8 per cent to $6.1 billion.  Other figures from the ABS showed international merchandise imports were down 4 per cent in December to $20.13 billion.  As the nation rouses itself from its summer slumber, the Reserve Bank of Australia will give an indication of its next move on interest rates when Governor Glenn Stevens fronts the House Economics Committee in Canberra on Friday.  The RBA delivered a sizeable one percentage point cut to the official rate in December, taking it to 4.25 per cent.  Since it last met, the United States has cut its official rate to 0.25 per cent and there has been more evidence of the slowing Australian economy, including a worsening jobs market.  The bank's board next meets on February 3.
