A senior member of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board says the government's December stimulus package was ineffective and instead the goods and services tax (GST) should be cut in half, RBA board member and Australian National University economist Warwick McKibbin suggests slashing the GST from 10 to five per cent until February next year. 'The December stimulus payments didn't have much impact ... the spending wasn't directed at the right things,' Professor McKibbin told the paper. 'We know that when the GST was introduced, people increased their spending ahead of time and then cut it afterwards. The trick would be to get people to bring their spending forward again but to get income tax cuts coming in the future so that the don't cut their spending too much when the GST goes up.' The latest idea to spark a revival in the economy comes as some of the nation's leading business figures call for the budget to be put into deficit and spend up big on infrastructure. The RBA meets next week to decide on the next move for interest rates, with many predicting a further cut of 75 to 100 basis points following the move by New Zealand's Reserve Bank yesterday to cut its cash rate by 150 points.
