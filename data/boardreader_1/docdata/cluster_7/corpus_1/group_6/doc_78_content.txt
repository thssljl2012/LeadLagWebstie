The Reserve Bank of Australia's monthly credit report shows that demand for credit dropped 0.3 per cent in December, cutting the annual rate of growth to 6.7 per cent from 8.2 per cent the previous month.  This was the third consecutive monthly decline.  This is despite the RBA having cut its key interest by 300 basis points over the last four months of 2008.  Financial markets are betting on another large rate reduction next week when the central bank holds its first board meeting of the year.  Business credit slumped by 1.1 per cent in December to an annual rate of 8.0 per cent.  Personal credit - outside of housing loans - was also down by a further 1.1 per cent in December, slumping 5.2 per cent over the year.  Total housing credit grew by a slim 0.4 per cent in December for an annual rate of 7.6 per cent.
