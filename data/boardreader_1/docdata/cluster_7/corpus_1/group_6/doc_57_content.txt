SYDNEY, Jan 14 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank   (NAB) is planning to sell at least A$500 million ($333.8 million)   of five-year government-backed bonds, three fund managers said on   Wednesday.   Indicative pricing of the floating rate note issue suggests   100 basis points over the bank bill swap rate, they said.   NAB declined to comment.   Australian regional lender Bank of Queensland is   also eyeing a government-backed bond issue, according to other   sources, in what would be Bank of Queensland's first such issue   since the guarantee was put in place late last year.   Australian banks are rushing to raise funds worldwide under   a new government guarantee to help them shore up their balance   sheets amid the global financial turmoil.   Australia's move follows similar guarantees introduced in   other countries.   Over US$29 billion in government-guaranteed bonds has   been raised by Australian banks since Dec. 10.
