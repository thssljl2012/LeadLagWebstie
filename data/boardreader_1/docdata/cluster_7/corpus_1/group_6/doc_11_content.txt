[ID:SYD6823] ----------------------------------------------------------------  * Aussie weakened against major currencies on Friday as investors recoiled from riskier assets after poor economic data pointed to more pain ahead in the world economy.  * The shock fall in Australian credit helped bond futures rally and encouraged investors to price in a cut of a full percentage point from the Reserve Bank of Australia next week.  * Data also showed recession in Japan may be deepening after industrial production fell a record 9.6 percent in December, while inflation slowed and unemployment rose. [ID:nT106804]  * Japan is Australia's second-biggest trading partner after China, auguring ill for exports.  * Aussie slid to $0.6472 compared to $0.6594 seen here on Thursday, and just a hair's breadth above the year's low of $0.6420.  * In a sign risk appetites have taken a hit, Asian stock markets fell on Friday. Japanese shares  dropped 3.2 percent and Australian stocks  were down 0.9 percent.  * Against the safe-haven yen, Aussie fell to 58.02 yen  from 59.23 on Thursday.  * It hugged two-week lows against the sterling at 0.4545 pounds , compared to Thursday's 0.4670.  * But Aussie was firm against a battered kiwi dollar at NZ$1.2694 , having hit a six-month high of NZ$1.2803 on Thursday.  * The kiwi fell to a new six-year low on Friday after the central bank governor hinted at more interest rate cuts, and said the economy will be pressured through the year. [ID:nWEL000836]  * Aussie bond futures bounced, outperforming huge losses in U.S. Treasuries that pushed yields to their highest levels in nearly two months. U.S. debt prices had sunk on worries about a massive imminent supply and waning foreign appetite. [US/]  * The spike in U.S. yields sharply narrowed the spread between Aussie and U.S. yields to around 124 basis points, the lowest since November, and diminishing the higher-yielding allure of Aussie.  * The spread and Aussie have moved in tandem since August, so the Aussie shrinking yield premium could presage further weakness in the local currency.  * The spread between Aussie and Euro 10-year yields is at its lowest in over six years at 80.4 basis points.  * Aussie 10-year bond futures fell 0.020 points to 95.910, while three-year bond futures were up 0.045 points at 97.060 after hitting a record high of 97.085 earlier.  * Interbank futures  were up 0.06 points at 96.700 points, reflecting expectations the central bank will cut interest rates by 100 basis points to a record low of 3.25 percent at its next policy meeting on Feb. 3.
