THE Australian dollar closed firmer for the first time in five days as a rally on Asian share markets and a jump in copper prices convinced traders the currency had been oversold.  At the market's close, the dollar was trading at US68.01c, up US0.54c from Tuesday's close of US67.47c, marking the first positive finish since last Friday.   The currency opened weaker, after hitting a one-month low below US66c during offshore trade, but began to recover in the early afternoon.   The unit closed at its daily high, a 2.8 per cent gain from an early morning low of US66.17c.   National Australia Bank currency strategist John Kyriakopoulos said the dollar climbed above Tuesday's closing levels soon after midday as traders realised the currency had been oversold in recent days.   While US equity markets were flat early yesterday, Asian share markets rallied, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 1.3 per cent.   Meanwhile, copper prices rose 4 per cent, another factor that convinced traders the Australian dollar had been oversold, Mr Kyriakopoulos said.   The dollar was expected to make gains during offshore trade but Mr Kyriakopoulos said the currency would face pressure today if official labour force data showed bigger than expected job losses for December.   Economists are tipping 20,000 retrenchments, and Mr Kyriakopoulos said the dollar could shed up to US2c if the data showed more than 30,000 job losses.   At the market's close, the Australian dollar was at 61.07 Japanese yen, up 1.3 per cent from Tuesday's close of Y60.29, and at 51.15 euro cents, up from E50.90.   The euro was up against the greenback and Japanese yen, at $US1.3296 and Y119.38.   At the market's close, the yield on the commonwealth government March 2019 bond was at 3.990 per cent, up from Tuesday's close of 3.956 per cent, while the yield on the April 2012 bond was at 3.160 per cent, little changed from 3.165 per cent.
