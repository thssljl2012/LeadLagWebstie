Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE ANZ bank could cut up to 3500 jobs - or 10 per cent of its workforce - as the world financial crisis takes its toll.  An unnamed source, described as 'well placed', told Fairfax newspapers the bank was looking to aggressively cut costs in the face of the downturn, and planned to axe 3000 to 3500 workers and contractors.  The redundancies are expected at least two weeks before Christmas, the source said.  'They are moving through the entire organisation. They are trying to take as much cost pressure out as they can,' the source told Fairfax.  ANZ spokesman Paul Edwards would not commit to a figure but said a restructure would most affect middle management and would affect less than 10 per cent of the workforce.  'Although we have said we don't expect the new structure to impact frontline roles, inevitably there will be an impact on roles in middle management,' Mr Edwards said.  The job losses would follow the announcement of big job cuts at a range of firms including Qantas and Ford.
