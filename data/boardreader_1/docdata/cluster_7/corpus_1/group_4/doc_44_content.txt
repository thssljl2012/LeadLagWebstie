THE BANGKO SENTRAL ng Pilipinas may scale down its balance of payments (BOP) forecasts for this year and next given the bleak global economic outlook triggered by the worst financial crisis to hit the western world in 80 years. 'The BOP numbers are under review now. There will be changes,' BSP Governor Amando Tetangco Jr. told reporters Friday.  The central bank earlier projected that the country would end this year with a BOP surplus of $2 billion. For 2009, the BSP was looking at a surplus of $2.3 billion.  The BOP measures the foreign exchange transactions between the local economy and the rest of the world. Any transaction which gives rise to a payment by a Philippine resident like importation or debt servicing is a deficit item in the BOP while any which gives rise to a receipt like borrowing, exporting or overseas Filipino remittance is a surplus item.  The Philippines incurred a BOP deficit of $482 million in September, the biggest monthly foreign exchange shortfall seen in four years, as an unprecedented shakeout in Wall Street triggered financial market turbulence across the globe.  Global risk aversion intensified in September and October--resulting in large outflows of foreign 'hot money' or investments in local stocks, bonds and bank products--following the collapse of iconic investment bank Lehman Brothers, the fire-sale of Merrill Lynch and the near-bankruptcy of insurance giant AIG.  For the first 10 months, net outflows of foreign portfolio investments hit $911.68 million, a sharp reversal of the $3.67 billion in net inflows seen in the same period last year.  But because of the large buffer built up in earlier months, the country still recorded a BOP surplus of $1.54 billion for the nine-month period, although much lower than the $6.7-billion surplus in the same period last year.  The BSP sees the country's trade gap swelling to a record high of $15.5 billion next year from about $13 billion this year on sluggish export earnings arising from a major global downturn.  Even remittances from overseas Filipinos are seen to decline especially next year due to the global slowdown. From a stop-gap measure initiated by the government to curb unemployment in the 1970s, overseas employment has developed into a vital industry generating foreign exchange that exceeded foreign investment inflows for the Philippines.  But despite the more challenging global financial environment, Tetangco said the BSP would not backtrack on its foreign exchange liberalization thrust that started last year when the peso was sharply rising against the dollar due to large foreign inflows. 'We have done most of the liberalization moves that we were thinking of. Any succeeding phase will basically tackle documentary requirements, so we're looking at that,' Tetangco said. For instance, the BSP jacked up banks' allowable foreign exchange holdings or 'overbought' limit to $50 million or 20 percent of unimpaired capital--the levels permitted before the Asian crisis of 1997. The central bank recently threatened to reduce this overbought limit to $20 million but dropped such plans after banks agreed among themselves to halve their foreign exchange purchases versus allowable limits.
