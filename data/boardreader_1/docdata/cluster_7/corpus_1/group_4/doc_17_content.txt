Banks clamping down on no-deposit loans  'Era of easy credit over,' analyst says  PROSPECTIVE homebuyers will find it hard to get no-deposit loans in the wake of the global credit crisis.  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has banned no-deposit loans and the ANZ has tightened eligibility requirements.  JP Morgan banking analyst Brian Johnson says stricter lending standards are here to stay.  'The era of getting very easy credit to buy a house is over,' he told ABC Radio, adding the move could have negative implications for house prices.  Aussie Home Loans boss John Symond says the change signals a return to sensible lending practices.  'Banks have got to have prudent lending,' he told ABC Radio.  'People buying home in Australia with little or no deposit is flawed process.'  'No deposit, no worries'  Lenders were criticised last month when they urged prospective buyers to use their first home owners grant - up to $21,000 in some cases - as their deposit.  A day after the government announced the boost to the first home owners grant, non-bank lender RAMS published full-page advertisements flashing the words 'No Deposit? No Worries' in giant letters.  As part of its financial rescue package, the Government increased the first home owners grant to $14,000 for established homes and $21,000 for new houses in a bid to stimulate the stagnant housing market.  Relaxed lending standards from US banks have been credited with sparking the turmoil in the current financial climate.  Banks and other lenders gave loans to people who traditionally would not have met lending criteria.  These loans were commonly referred to as 'sub-prime'. When people started defaulting on their loans, banks were left with billions of dollars out of pocket.
