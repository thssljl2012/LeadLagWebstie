 jobs could go in the next 12 to 18 months if the big banks restructure their workforces, the Finance Sector Union (FSU) says.   FSU national secretary Leon Carter said speculation that ANZ Bank planned to cut 3,000 of its staff in the lead-up to Christmas could trigger mass sackings at the other big banks.   Already there is speculation that Westpac will shed 5,000 jobs when it merges with St George. 'We think that 10,000 jobs could disappear out of the banking sector over the next 12 to 18 months,' Mr Carter told reporters in Melbourne today.   He called on the Federal Government to pressure the banks to forgo sackings after it gave taxpayer-funded guarantees on all savings in Australian banks.   AAP
