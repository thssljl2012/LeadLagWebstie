Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE Queensland Government has donated $500,000 to kick-start a new disaster fund to help those affected by storms that tore across southeast Queensland on Sunday.  The Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal, announced by Queensland Premier Anna Bligh this afternoon, will supplement other government assistance.  Ms Bligh said times would be tough for families in the lead-up to Christmas with more than 4000 homes affected by the storm.  'This (money) is for when all the other government assistance just hasn't been enough,' Ms Bligh said.  'These storms have cut a swathe right through these suburbs. I'd encourage people to dig deep.'  People can donate money to any branch of the Commonwealth Bank.
