The crane and equipment hire specialist posted a 13.1 per cent increase in net profit to $13.8 million during the six months to September 30 after strong divisional performances across the group.  The company delivered a 20.1 per cent increase in revenue during the first half to $175.96 million.  Tutt Bryant has forecast profit for the 2009 financial year to be in the range of $19 million to $21 million, down on the fiscal 2008 result of $26.57 million.  The company said its distribution division, which sells construction equipment, parts and service, would be the hardest hit by a weaker Australian dollar and tightening credit facilities to customers.  The restricted access to funds, however, is resulting in clients choosing to rent rather than buy and providing a boon to the group's general hire division, the company said.  Tutt Bryant said the company was constantly reviewing all aspects of the business to minimise negative impacts and to maximise the potential for ongoing, stable trading conditions. 'Our business model, geographic spread and the complementary nature of our various divisions, maximises our own stability and ability to operate with confidence,' managing director David Haynes said in a statement.  Tutt Bryant shares had lost 2.5 cents, or 3.03 per cent to 80 cents by 1022 AEDT on Wednesday.
