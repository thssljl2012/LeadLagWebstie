Australia's unemployment rate held steady in October, surprising economists who had predicted greater job losses because of the global financial crisis.  The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.3 per cent.  Official figures show more than 32,000 full time workers have lost their jobs in the past two months, but more than 40,000 part-time workers were employed in October.  Chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank, Michael Blythe, says the rise in part-time work is a sign that businesses are reluctant to lose skilled staff.'Possibly what's happening here is that the brunt of the adjustment is occurring in terms of the hours worked rather than outright job losses,' he said.'But you can only go so far down that path, and I've no doubt we will see some sort of labour shakeout and creep up in unemployment from here.'
