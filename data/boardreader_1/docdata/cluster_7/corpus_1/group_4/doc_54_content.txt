(Xinhua via COMTEX News Network) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its key interest rate on Tuesday by three-quarters of a percentage point to 5.25 percent from 6.0 percent.   RBA governor Glenn Stevens made the announcement on Tuesday in a statement emerging from RBA's monthly board meeting.   He said the recent reductions in borrowing rates, the depreciation of the exchange rate and the fiscal stimulus announced in October will work to assist growth in the period ahead. 'But deteriorating international conditions and falling commodity prices will have a dampening influence,' Stevens said. The central bank cut the rate by a surprise one percentage point last month to prevent the economy being dragged into a recession in the face of a deepening global financial crisis.   Economic data since then has proved grim reading, pointing to rising unemployment, falling house prices and weak consumer spending. 'Global disinflationary forces will assist in this regard, though the depreciation of the exchange rate means that the decline of inflation to the target could take longer than would otherwise be the case,' said Stevens. 'Weighing up these international and domestic developments, the board judged that a further significant reduction in the cash rate was warranted. The board will continue to monitor developments and make adjustments as needed to promote sustainable growth consistent with achieving the 2-3 per cent inflation target over time,' Stevens said. Meanwhile, the decision to again cut official interest rates was welcomed by business circles. New South Wales Business Chamber chief executive Kevin MacDonald said on Tuesday the rates cut would boost business confidence.   But he called on the retail banks to pass on the full 0.75 percentage point rate cut, particularly in the area of business- related lending. 'Business operators are feeling the heat at the moment, with the economy slowing and the cost of doing business on the rise,' MacDonald said in a statement.
