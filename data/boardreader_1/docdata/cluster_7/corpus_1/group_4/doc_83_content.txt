Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE Australian dollar was 1.5 per cent weaker at noon as estimates that Europe was already in recession stirred more fears about a slowing world economy.  But the domestic currency could get a boost today if the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cuts interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50 basis points, as economists are expecting.  At 12noon (AEDT), the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6723/28, down US1c from yesterday's close of $US0.6823/28.  During the morning, the local currency traded between a late morning low of $US0.6722 and an early high of $US0.6821.  The Australian dollar has struggled today, after the European Commission said the region's economy was likely to have entered a recession this year.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joseph Capurso said the dire economic news from Europe had hurt the local currency as traders worried about a slowing global economy.  'That raises questions about the world economy and Australia is a small, open economy, so you get hit from whatever happens overseas,'' he said.  'That's the reason we saw softening.''  The Brussels-based European Commission forecast economic growth in the 15-member euro zone contracting by 0.1 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of 2008.  The European economy shrank 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of this year, the commission estimated.  Mr Capurso said the Australian dollar could surge to $US0.6850 this afternoon if the RBA cut rates by a smaller than expected 25 basis points.  He said the RBA expected the banks to match in full any official rate cut this month, amid a fall in wholesale funding costs in recent weeks.  The RBA slashed rates by 100 basis points in October on the expectation the banks would not pass on in full an official easing in monetary policy.  'Commercial banks have passed that on to their clients: the Reserve Bank was not expecting that,'' Mr Capurso said about how the major banks cut lending rates by 80 basis points in early October and by another 20 basis points at the end of last month.  All 15 economists surveyed by AAP, including the Commonwealth Bank, are expecting a 50 basis point rate cut announcement which would take the cash rate to 5.5 per cent, for the first time since May 2006.  The RBA board met this morning and is due to announce the outcome of its monthly board meeting at 2.30pm AEDT.  With Victoria on holiday today, foreign exchange liquidity is thinner than usual.
