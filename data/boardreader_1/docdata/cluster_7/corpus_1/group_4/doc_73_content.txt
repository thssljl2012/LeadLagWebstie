Families and small business would welcome a Melbourne Cup day interest rate cut, federal Treasurer Wayne Swan says.  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will announce its rates decision at 2.30pm (AEDT) - 30 minutes before the attention of most Australians is focused on the horse race that stops the nation.  Most economic pundits are tipping the central bank to cut its key cash rate by at least 50 basis points to 5.5 per cent, on the back of a 100 point cut last month. 'There's no doubt that families and small businesses would welcome some great relief on cup day,' Mr Swan told ABC Radio.  He said the RBA had already delivered 'substantial relief' last month, with a full percentage point cut. 'Something like 125 basis points have been passed on but we'll just have to wait until this afternoon to see what the Reserve Bank does.' Mr Swan urged the retail banks to pass on any cuts in full.
