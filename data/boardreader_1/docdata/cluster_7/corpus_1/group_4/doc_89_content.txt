The banks have done something unusual in the past couple of weeks - cut their credit card interest rates.  Commonwealth Bank announced it would cut card rates by 0.6 percentage points across the board - its platinum and gold card purchase rates fall from 20.74 per cent to 20.14 per cent and its low-rate card drops from 13.24 per cent to 12.64 per cent.  Westpac said card rates would be cut by as much as 0.8 percentage points but did not specify individual card rate changes. ANZ said card rates would be cut by 0.75 percentage points but gave no detail.  Credit card issuers have resisted passing on rate cuts. Figures supplied by researcher Infochoice show credit card rates for the big five banks rose by more than official rate increases between August last year and March, when the Reserve Bank lifted rates four times for a total of 1 percentage point. Some purchase rates went up by as much as 3 percentage points in that period and cash-advance rates went up by as much as 5 percentage points.  Issuers defend their rate changes by arguing customers are prepared to pay a premium for convenience. They also argue they have set rates at appropriate levels given the risks involved.  St George Bank reported bad debt write-offs on its credit cards rose from $98 million in the 2006-07 financial year to $116 million in 2007-08, an increase of almost 20 per cent. Chief executive Paul Fegan says high rates were justified in these circumstances.  Westpac chief executive Gail Kelly made similar comments when she presented the bank's 2007-08 financial results on October 30, saying: 'It is a risky product. It is one where you get losses when the economy turns.' Westpac added an extra $76 million to its provisions for bad and doubtful debts in its latest results, earmarked for likely future losses on credit cards.  Clearly, the banks are having more trouble with credit card accounts going bad. But are the bad debts enough to justify not passing on any of the recent rate cuts to card holders?  Westpac's accounts show its net interest margin is 2.1 per cent - the difference between the bank's cost of funds and the average rate it charges on its portfolio of loan products.  Breaking that down, the margin on business loans is 1.5 per cent and the margin on mortgages is 0.8 per cent. The margin on credit cards is a whopping 5.4 per cent. Such a big differential in margins between products has given rise to accusations the banks are keeping credit card rates high to subsidise other low-margin products.  Another argument card issuers use to justify high credit card rates is card users are insensitive to rates because they pay their accounts in full each month and have very little in the way of outstanding balances.  The evidence does not support this claim. The average for each account is close to $1300.
