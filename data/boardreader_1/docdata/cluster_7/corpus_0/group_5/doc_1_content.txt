Central Bank Miscast in Spaghetti Western Role: Caroline Baum Commentary by Caroline Baum                                                                                                                                                                Dec. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Central bankers come and go, but they leave behind a trail of odd ideas about monetary policy.             Take the current obsession with lowering short-term interest rates below a certain level in a rapidly deteriorating global economy.             Last week, the European Central Bank slashed its benchmark rate by 75 basis points to 2.5 percent for a cumulative decline of 175 points in the last two months. At the press conference following the meeting, ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet was asked whether there was a limit to the decline in rates. (Yes, they cant go below zero.)             Instead of stating the obvious, Trichet hit the default setting. We have to beware of being trapped at nominal levels that would be much too low, he said.             Trapped? Trichets trap is eerily like the one imagined by central bankers across the pond in late 2002 and 2003, the last time deflation fears surfaced. Federal Reserve policy makers were concerned about operational problems when the overnight interest rate approaches the zero bound.             Fast forward five years, the Fed is still concerned, yet it has found previously unimaginable ways around the zero bound.             Two weeks ago, ECB Executive Board Member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi echoed Trichets sentiment, choosing a Wild West analogy.             There is a risk that policy makers run out of ammunition too early and remain without a means of escape, Bini Smaghi said in a Nov. 25 speech in Madrid. Invoking the great spaghetti westerns of our youth, he said that the good guys win if they shoot first, assuming they hit the target. The good guys lose if the cavalry is surrounded, without any ammunition left.             Hoarding Ammo             That may be true, but by definition you cant win without firing.             If youre under siege, you dont want to be found dead with ammo left in your gun, said Bob McTeer, former president of the Dallas Fed.             The ammunition analogy took me back 20 years to the time when the Fed was engaged in an extended easing cycle. Between 1989 and 1992, the Fed took the funds rate down to 3 percent from 9.75 percent. A 3 percent overnight rate was unthinkable to those who had lived through the inflationary 1970s.             With each baby step taking the funds rate closer to its nadir, a chorus of Fed watchers (yes, thats what they were called back then) warned that the Fed needed to keep its powder dry, presumably saving it for a rainy day. Some Fed officials even used that language to describe the fix they were in.             So Raise Rates             The thinking never made sense then, and it doesnt make any now. My standard retort was always the same. Monetary policy is like fine wine. It has to be uncorked and allowed to breathe. Keep it bottled up, and things could get worse.             European economists clearly had some fun with Trichets claim that the ECB could find itself trapped at nominal levels that are too low.             I have no idea what that means, wrote Erik Nielsen, chief European economist for Goldman Sachs International in London, in a note to clients. Cant they just raise rates again if they think they got too low?             The ECB is nowhere close to running out of ammunition, wrote Holger Schmieding, director of European Economics for Bank of America in London. A refusal to shoot in earnest today would have put the cavalry at grave risk of being run over by the bad guys, to stay with the Bini Smaghi metaphor.             Good, Bad, Ugly             While central bankers in the U.S. have pretty much abandoned monetarism under the guise of an inability to define what constitutes money, their counterparts in Europe inherited their DNA from the inflation-phobic German Bundesbank.             Surely Monsieur Trichet and his colleagues understand the concept of quantitative easing, or printing money by any other name. The bank adheres to a two pillar approach in an effort to achieve price stability, with one of the pillars being monetary analysis. (The other is economic analysis.) The ECBs balance sheet has increased by 53 percent in the past year, peanuts compared with the Feds 144 percent.             It is odd, to say the least, to hear monetarists talk about being trapped under a low interest rate. The rate is the means of delivering a quantity (of money). When the rate hits zero, it cant go any lower, thats true. The Fed can still expand its balance sheet. The effective federal funds rate has averaged 0.4 percent for the past month, without imposing a hurdle.             In theory, there is no limit to the amount of credit the Fed can extend. In reality, the size of its balance sheet is constrained by foreigners willingness to hold a fistful of dollars -- and even a few dollars more.             The spaghetti western theme must be contagious.
