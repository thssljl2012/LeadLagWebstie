Current Price Trends Auguststatistics just released by the NWMLS show another modestincrease in the median home price. The median home price for Puyallup endedAugust at $266k - still, a 10% drop in year-to-date appreciation. Today&amp;#8217;s news in the financial market - namely Lehman Brothers going bankrupt, Merrill Lynch being sold to Bank of America, and the possible restructure of AIG - will likely cause mortgage banks to further reassess risk. What this means is less money to lend to fewer people; less money to fewer people will mean fewer homes selling and the continued erosion of equity in Puyallup real estate.  The average cumulative days on market - total time a home is for sale, from listing to closing -rose inAugustto146 days from 138 days the previous month.
