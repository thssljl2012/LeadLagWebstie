 The situation in the world finance crisis as I understand it today:Unregulated estate angents, trying to increase their profits while selling other peoples' property, have pushed the price of houses up as far as possible, making houses largely unaffordable.Banks, in order not to lose the very profitable mortgage business, have pushed people to get into debt beyond what they can afford by mortgaging a too-high percentage of houses and encouraging people to borrow more than they should based on their real earnings.People are forced into debt in order to pay their mortgage.Business and people suffer from the continued increases in taxes over the past twelve years, coupled with reduced services.Prices go up so that companies can pay for their increased debts.Salaries did not increase as fast as the prices increased for the same reason.People could not afford to pay their excessive debts.Banks repossessed the homes of these people, did not recuperate the high-interest rates on which they were betting and got into trouble.The government's reaction, while stating that they will do "whatever is necessary" to resolve the issue:By-pass the existing laws seeking to protect consumers and competition in order to allow the creation of a mega-bank (Lloyds-TrusteeSavingsBank-Halifax-BankOfScotland) that will be able to dictate the market.Increase taxes on the people who are in debt and struggling to survive in their existing debtsBlame the problems on world situation which no one can control while repeating that we need to trust Gordon Brown as the only one who can control this.Generally it is accepted that a change in a government's policies take about seven years to trickle down to the people and the results be truly felt. But that does not matter, because everything negative in politics is someone else's fault, everything positive is thanks to the government.And they wonder why people are disaffected and there is low-turnout for votes.
