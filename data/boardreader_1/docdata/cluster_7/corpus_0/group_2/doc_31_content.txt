It looks as if the Reserve Bank of Australia will ease monetary policy  by  starting to reduce interest rates as the global economy takes a downturn. Economists in the financial market (most are ex-Treaasury or ex RBA economists) are saying that this will likely be one of several cuts to boost  a slowing  economy.    Dyson  Business is saying its confidence is shattered; that the economy is fragile;the brakes have been on for too long, there is too much uncertainty  and that they need some relief quick fast. Poor business.Unlike the Reserve Bank they have a very clear idea where the economy is going. Not for them the image of driving an unfamiliar care with dim headlights on a foggy night unsure where the next bend is or what direction the road takes.
