     Last nights takeover of Washington Mutual Savings, the nations largest savings and loan, marked the end of the major Sub-prime and Alt-A lenders.&amp;nbsp; About 15 months ago, this market started to collapse.&amp;nbsp; The first to go was Greenpoint Mortgage, which was closed by Capital One in October 2007.&amp;nbsp; Last January Aurora Loan Services, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers, stopped accepting loan applications and Countrywide was taken over by Bank of America.&amp;nbsp; Indymac Bank was closed by the fed in July and Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15th of this year.  The failure of Washington Mutual is the largest bank failure in our history.&amp;nbsp; The $310 billion in assets dwarfs the $40 billion Continental Bank failure in 1984.&amp;nbsp; Washington Mutual has 2300 branches with total deposits of $182 billion.&amp;nbsp; The run on the bank started earlier this month, and in the last ten days customers have withdrawn over $16 billion from Washington Mutual.  No doc and stated income loans are a thing of the past; our last investor for stated income loans stopped accepting applications earlier this month.&amp;nbsp; I don't think stated income loans will be back in our lifetime.&amp;nbsp; Many people who lived through the 1930 depression still didn't trust banks as late as the 1980's.&amp;nbsp; The regulations that are are sure to be adopted with the proposed bank bailout will certainly prohibit these loans.  Fannie Mae has adopted the four loan limitation for second home and investment properties, and has increased the up front costs for investment properties.&amp;nbsp; Up front points with 25% down are 1.75%, with 20% down the points are 3.00%, and with less than 20% down the additional points are 3.75%.&amp;nbsp; These new rules will undoubtedly slow down the investors who have been bottom fishing in the foreclosure market.   Until Congress comes up with some kind of bailout plan, we will not have any indication of the direction of interest rates.&amp;nbsp; Today's rate for a low point low fee 30 year fixed rate loan is 6.25%.
