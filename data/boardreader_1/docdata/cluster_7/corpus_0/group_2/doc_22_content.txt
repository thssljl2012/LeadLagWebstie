 In an unknown location, a handful of Australia's best known companies and government agencies are undertaking secret tests in a mock cyberwar, as the country's infrastructure comes under attack in a simulated online war named Cyber Storm II.This week, as part of Cyber Storm II, 50 critical infrastructure businesses are discovering not just what they can do for Australia under a cyberattack but what they can't. The exercises, which began on Tuesday, involve a series of simulated online and physical attacks, targeting a number of Australia's most important critical infrastructure businesses, including the Commonwealth Bank, Energex and Telstra.Australia's involvement is being controlled from a secret location in Victoria, a spokesperson for Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, told ZDNet.com.au."From there we'll throw out different scenarios to all those involved," the spokesperson said.Exactly what scenarios participating organisations have been facing, however, remains a secret -- to protect the vulnerabilities being tested, the spokesperson said. Several government agencies are taking part in the exercise, including the Australian Federal Police, the Office of the Attorney General and Department of Defence. Of the 50 Australian organisations taking part in the international exercise, only 28 were willing to reveal their involvement. From the financial sector are Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Westpac, ANZ, Bank of Queensland, Bendigo Bank and Citigroup. The Australian Stock Exchange and the Reserve Bank of Australia also participated.The energy sector is well represented too, with Woodside Energy, Country Energy, Energex, Energy Networks Association, Ergon Energy as well as South Australia's Department of Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.
