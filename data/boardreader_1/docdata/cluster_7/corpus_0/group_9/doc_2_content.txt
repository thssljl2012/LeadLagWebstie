Yet more of what hasn&#8217;t worked:  TREASURY is preparing the ground for a massive new burst of fiscal stimulus in next month&#8217;s budget, declaring that the measures to date have averted a plunge in consumer spending.  Consumer spending isn&#8217;t the problem. This is:  SENIOR federal ministers and industry leaders are laying the ground for a sharp rise in the number of Australians out of work, with the budget forecast on unemployment now certain to pass 7 per cent.    Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner and Treasurer Wayne Swan all conceded next month&#8217;s budget would reveal a higher forecast for unemployment in the wake of gloomy new global economic predictions, and an admission by the Reserve Bank that Australia is in recession.  And this was precisely what Kevin Rudd once claimed his lavish spending of our savings - and now borrowings - would avert:  Last November, Rudd thought his $10.4 billion stimulus package would &#8221;create up to 75,000 additional jobs over the coming year&#8221;. He was wrong...  Terry McCrann is getting nervous:  If the rest of the world is in serious recession, we can&#8217;t avoid following. That was deputy (Reserve Bank)  governor Ric Battelino&#8217;s message on Tuesday.    To attempt to pump-prime our way from following would not only be futile. Much like standing on the beach as the tsunami approaches, thinking you could drain the water away with a big hose.    Worse, it would threaten to do serious damage itself. From further promoting especially first-home buying at the bottom end of the property market to&#8212;from the fiscal pump-priming&#8212;leaving us with an excessively large public debt.
