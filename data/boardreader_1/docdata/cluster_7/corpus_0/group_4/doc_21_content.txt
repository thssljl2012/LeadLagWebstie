The Commonwealth Bank-Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) business expectations index found business conditions fell to an index of 41.1 in three months to September. This is the lowest level since the survey began in 1994. A level below 50 indicates business conditions are contracting. "Australian businesses are negotiating some extremely heavy weather at the moment," ACCI's director of industry policy and economics Greg Evans told reporters in Canberra.
