Right now, Asian markets are soaring, Japan because of a slightly weaker Yen which is important to their export industries and slightly better machinery orders, according to NikkeiNet.   China is pledging a stimulus package of $586B. Since China has been the single largest source of growth, this could substantially improve living standards in China.  Watch for commodities to boom.  Taiwan has also lowered its interest rate. For some reason, the Japanese think that the Chinese are going to borrow in yen, because interest rates are low in Japan. But&amp;#8230; aren&amp;#8217;t the Chinese going to have to use dollars as collateral, and isn&amp;#8217;t that going to tank the dollar?  As Rachel Maddow might say, &amp;#8220;Talk me down.&amp;#8221; The bad news: insurance giant AIG may have burned through $85B in just a few short weeks. In any event, it&amp;#8217;s coming back for a sweeter deal, seeking to convert debt into preferred shares. If I were nervous about rising interest rates and the strength of the dollar, this would make me more nervous.  Come to think of it, I am nervous about rising interest rates and the strength of the dollar.
