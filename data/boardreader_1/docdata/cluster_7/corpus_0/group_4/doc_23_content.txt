I have been wondering over the past 9 months why the NAB bank shares are so low compared to say the Commonwealth bank and others. At present about 15 to 20 dollars a share. I have been asking my self why is this so when they were up to about 40 dollars and is surposed to be such a strong bank. How ever, I have Just been told this information and I believe it, as it is in Australian Liqudation reports.2000 which I have SEEN and is surposed to be in reports ...
