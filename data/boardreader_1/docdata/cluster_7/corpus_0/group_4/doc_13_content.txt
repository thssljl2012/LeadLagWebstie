           When the Bank slashed rates from 4.5 per cent to 3 per cent, Britain's 25 million savers were predicted to be the biggest losers.  Though savings rates started to fall immediately, the full cut has not been passed on, because banks are trying to attract valuable deposits to bolster their balance sheets.  According to MoneyFacts, the personal finance website, the average fixed rate savings account has fallen from 5.52 per cent to 4.73 per cent  reflecting only half of the Bank's base rate cut.  This week the Bank's governor Mervyn King refused to rule out base rates falling as low as zero. However, one-fifth of all the accounts on the market pay 6 per cent or more, and promise to do so for a fixed amount of time, even if base rates should continue to fall.  Kent Reliance Building Society offers 6 per cent for a whole year if you deposit just 100, while Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank both pay 6 per cent if you put 2,000 in.  If you want to lock away for just a few months, Halifax Online Fixed Rate Web Saver pays 6.5 per cent if you've got 500 or more.  Barclays even offers 7.75 per cent if you are prepared to deposit up to 250 a month, and you do not make a withdrawal.  Savings analysts said it was "unprecedented" for savers to enjoy rates of double the Bank of England base rate.  Kevin Mountford, head of savings at Moneysupermarket.com, said: "Whilst the boom rates of recent months have started to slide there is still good value to be had in the savings market."  However, experts warned that savers needed to move very quickly as remaining high rates will start to fall by the end of the month.
