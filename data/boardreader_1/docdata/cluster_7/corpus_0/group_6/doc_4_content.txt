The renewed concern about the futures of the nation&#8217;s largest financial institutions is working its way into short-term lending rates and key swap spreads, interrupting the steady improvement in those indicators that had taken place since late November. In action Thursday, swap spreads, a measure of credit risk, have widened out, along with mortgage spreads and Eurodollar futures, which serve as a traded proxy for expectations for Libor. &#8220;The Bank of America news, the Citigroup news, those needing more capital, that has spooked the market a little bit,&#8221; says John Brady, head of hedge-fund sales at MF Global.  Eurodollar futures are based on three-month U.S. dollar Libor rates. March Eurodollar futures, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, were down 12.5 basis points to 98.955, implying higher yields, and therefore, higher borrowing costs.  That contract hit a low of 98.92 earlier in the session, continuing a decline from Wednesday. At 98.955, that implies a Libor yield of 1.08% in March; the British Bankers Association set the three-month dollar Libor Thursday at 1.08563%. It is down from a high of 4.81875% about three months ago.  In addition, credit-default swap indexes tracking corporate and high-yield bonds were wider Thursday, according to Markit. The Markit CDX IG index rose to imply a cost of insurance protection as high oas $226,000, but was lately at $222,000, up from about $218,000 Wednesday. Similarly, Credit Derivatives Research&#8217;s Counterparty Index, which measures credit-default swap spreads for 15 major financial institutions, hit a one-month high. That index implied a cost of $187,930 to insure $10 million in bonds against default for five years; it hit a record of $300,000 in mid-September, following the Lehman Brothers collapse. Other spreads were wider as well. Two-year swap spreads (where investors exchange fixed- and floating-rate obligations) were wider by seven to eight basis points, according to Glenn Holland, senior vice president in the fixed-income strategies group at Newedge USA. &#8220;It looks like the bank jitters equals equity jitters, which equals people shedding risky assets,&#8221; he says. It will take time to determine how long the heightened worry lasts. Corporate bond deals are attracting investors, and spreads have improved since the beginning of the month. As of Thursday morning, Barclays Capital&#8217;s investment-grade index traded at 5.17 percentage points over comparable Treasurys, nearly 0.4 percentage point tighter than at the beginning of the year. However, those spreads are wider Thursday. &#8220;After that [October] freak-out, volatility came off, and credit spreads came in and narrowed, but the trades that had expressed that view have been taken off,&#8221; says Mr. Brady. He says there has not yet been a resurgence of trading hedging against a return to conditions that existed in the fall. &#8220;All of these trades from the last month, month-and-a-half &#8212; those are being taken off.&#8221;
