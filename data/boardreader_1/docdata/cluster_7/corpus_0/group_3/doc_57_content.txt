Gun-Wielding German Officers Fight Growing Underground Economy      Quote:                    Germany is cracking down on its growing black-market economy as workers duck some of the highest taxes in Europe. With companies trying to cut costs as the global credit crisis pushes Europe's largest economy near recession, more people may be forced underground. And Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to extend the minimum wage, a move economists say may send more work under the table and cost as many as 600,000 jobs.              ``There's a higher risk of wage increases resulting in even more job cuts in the current environment,'' said Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at Bank of America Corp. ``We're obviously at the beginning of a recession, and that's why it would be dangerous to raise wages by a significant extent.''              The current minimum-wage coverage of about 1.7 million of 40 million workers may almost double if the new rules are approved. Industries including security and health services would join postal and construction companies in applying minimum pay, which ranges from 6.58 euros ($9) an hour to 12.85 euros.                     http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...vk&amp;amp;refer=news#
