WASHINGTON &amp;mdash; Unemployment claims, already well into recession territory, are rising even faster than expected, leading economists to warn Thursday that the worst is yet to come.As the Labor Department released bleak new numbers on the job market, Goldman Sachs, Chrysler and Xerox all announced they were cutting workers by the thousands, adding to the woes of an economy beset by tighter credit and wobbly banks.The government said new applications for unemployment insurance rose 15,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 478,000, compared with analysts' estimates of 470,000. Jobless claims of more than 400,000 are considered a sign of recession.Zach Pandl, an economist at Barclays Capital, estimates that unemployment will rise to between 7 percent and 8 percent by early next year. Other economists have estimated it could rise to 8.5 percent.
