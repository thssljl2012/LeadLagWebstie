Today's world is full of uncertain, one day stock market might be up the next day came crashing down to record lows. Not just that, also look at the oil prices and aussie dollar. Every thing around us uncertain, do not ever think anything is yours until you have got it as anything could happen. A good comes out of it is that Commonwealth Bank is one of the strongest bank in the world with one of the top 28 banks thats rate AA, so that means I won't loose my job. Also i have recently added additonal service to my job, that is to open bank accounts and credit cards and insurance. If any one has any banking needs please let me know. Will be gladly to help. I have now allocate20% of my time doing other banking.
