NZ First leader Winston Peters has taken the unusual step of proposing the flotation of Kiwibank on the stock market and the limitation of share ownership to New Zealand residents. Peters said in a speech yesterday NZ First would also separate Kiwibank from NZ Post and direct the government to put its NZ$55 billion worth of banking business through Kiwibank, rather than through its current bank Westpac. I think there may be some practical and financial problems with separating Kiwibank from NZ Post. Currently Kiwibank uses NZ Post branches and also provides some bill payments services to NZ Post. For that service Kiwibank received NZ$41.39 million from NZ Post last year, which some argue is a subsidy that inflates Kiwibanks profit, which was NZ$36.82 million last year.  Kiwibank probably wouldnt be profitable if it was cut loose from NZ Post. Meanwhile Winston Peters has also repeated his call for a rewrite of the Reserve Bank Act to make it target employment and the exchange rate as well as inflation. My view is the Reserve Bank Act works because it targets inflation alone and allows the Governor independence to target inflation. Low inflation for the 1990s and the early 2000s was a hard won benefit that should not be given up easily. But what are your thoughts?
