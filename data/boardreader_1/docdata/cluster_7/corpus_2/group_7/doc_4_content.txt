"COMMONWEALTH Bank said it will cut its variable home loan rate by 1 per cent, making it the last of the big four banks to pass on the Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate cut in full.      The cut lowers Commonwealth Bank's variable mortage rate to  5.74 per cent from Februrary 13 ."      Cheers
