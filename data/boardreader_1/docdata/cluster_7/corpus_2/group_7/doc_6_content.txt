The slowdown continued,        although not to the extent expected by the market.        "In my opinion, housing maintenance prices, that is        regulated prices, are to blame for the surprise on the upside.        "The data is slightly supportive for the cautious wing of        the council. When you add in the weakening zloty, then it might        be an argument for a rate cut of 25 basis points, that is less        than previously seen.        "Today's data doesn't change the inflation outlook. We have        to wait for the revised numbers, which we expect to be cut to        3.0, maybe even lower. We expect a further decline in inflation,        However, the weakening zloty might stabilise it at a higher        level."            MICHAL DYBULA, ECONOMIST AT BNP PARIBAS:        "This is noT surprising data, I think it won't have an        impact on the market. I think the disinflation factors were fuel        and food prices. But... I think net inflation probably remained        at a quite high level.        "In the near future, I would expect a further decline in        consumer prices year-on-year, mostly due to supply factors and        weakening demand pressure on prices.        "The Monetary Policy Council's decision may be influenced by        industrial output data that will -- based on credible leading        indicators -- show a further sharp fall in production."
