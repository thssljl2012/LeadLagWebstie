HOMEOWNERS will get another boost this week with the Reserve Bank of Australia expected to slash a further 0.75 per cent or more from its interest rate.     The move will lower the bank's cash rate to 3.5 per cent, bringing variable rate loans to around 5.5 per cent or 6 per cent.      Economists already are pencilling in further RBA cuts to a low of 2 per cent. Macquarie's Rory Robertson said the RBA would cut the rate by a full 1 per cent, or 100 basis points.     "There's some risk of less or more than 100 basis points, of course, but for me it's now a struggle to envisage either the 75 points cut still favoured by some, or the 125-150bp option," he said.     Last week's consumer price index figures moved inflation technically back to an acceptable level allowing the RBA more freedom to move on interest rates.
