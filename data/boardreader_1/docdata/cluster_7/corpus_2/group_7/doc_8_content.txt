A quarterly gauge of business confidence has fallen to an all-time low as companies hunker down for a year ahead of weak profits and faltering growth.     Companies' confidence dropped to minus-31 index points in the three months to December, the lowest level since the data series began in 1989, according to the National Australia Bank's quarterly survey.     That compares with the September quarter's contraction to minus-7 index points and brings to a full year quarterly readings in negative territory.     The index has now been in negative territory since January last year, reflecting a growing fear businesses in Australia won't escape the effects of the global downturn underway.
