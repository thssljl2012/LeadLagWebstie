                    Latvia May Lead 50% Devaluation in Baltic Currencies, BBH Says                                   Latvia May Lead 50% Devaluation in Baltic Currencies, BBH Says         Feb. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Latvias weakening economy may force the nation to relax its management of the lats, spurring all three Baltic currencies to break their pegs by mid-year and fall as much as 50 percent to the euro, Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. says.      Latvia stands out as the weakest of the three because its external debt is very high and its got a big current-account deficit, said Win Thin, New York-based senior currency strategist at the oldest privately-owned U.S. bank. The contagion between the three is so strong that if Latvia broke the others wouldnt be able to resist.      The Baltic nations are struggling to keep their currencies pegged to the euro in preparation to adopt the common European currency as their economies contract amid the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression. Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are under pressure to follow Russia and Kazakhstan in reducing their currency management and allowing devaluation, Nouriel Roubini, the New York University professor who forecast the U.S. recession, said last week.       Latvias economy shrank 10.5 percent in the fourth quarter, the steepest drop in the European Union and the countrys biggest since quarterly annual records began in 1995, according to preliminary data. The nation has to fund a 92.5 million lati ($168 million) current-account deficit while credit markets around the world remain frozen.      Lithuania is heading into a two-year recession with gross domestic product forecast to decline 4.9 percent this year, the nations central bank said last week. Estonias economy contracted an annual 3.5 percent in the third quarter, the weakest in the 27-member European Union after Latvia, and may shrink 8.9 percent this year, according to its central bank.       Dwindling Reserves      Dwindling reserves may force the Baltic currencies devaluation, according to Thin. Latvias reserves have dropped 27 percent to $4.7 billion since July, according to data from its central bank as of Jan. 31. Estonias declined 5 percent to $3.9 billion in the second half of last year, and Lithuanias slumped 13 percent to $6.3 billion, International Monetary Fund data show.      Theyre going to run out of reserves and funds at some point and theyll look to contain the reserves bleed, Thin said in an interview.       Latvia is the most indebted among east European nations with external debt equivalent to 130 percent gross domestic product. Estonia is 108 percent and Lithuania is 70 percent, according to Brown Brothers data. Russian debt by comparison is just is just 34 percent of GDP.       You cant rely on external funding in a global environment like this, Thin said. The longer this crisis drags on the higher the likelihood that their pegs will collapse.      Latvia buys and sells foreign-currency reserves to prevent the lats from fluctuating more than 1 percent either side of 0.702804 per euro. It was little changed at 0.7064 per euro by 2:55 p.m. in Riga.      Keeping Pegs      Latvias currency gained 0.2 percent against the euro this year, while Russias ruble slumped 15 percent against the dollar, and the Kazakh tenge was devalued 21 percent last week. Belarus ruble management weakened 21 percent. A 50 percent decline would leave the lats at about 1.4 per euro based on yesterdays closing price.      The Estonian kroon is kept around 15.6466 per euro, while the litas stays at about 3.4528 per euro. This type of management regime is often called a currency board.      The IMF is allowing Latvia to keep its peg while receiving 7.5 billion euros ($9.6 billion) in assistance. The Washington- based fund demanded Ukraine move toward a more flexible exchange- rate regime for the hryvnia when it offered the nation $16.4 billion. The hryvnia has weakened 52 percent to the dollar in the past six months.      The IMF has taken a hit to their reputation by allowing Latvia to retain its fixed currency regime, Thin said.
