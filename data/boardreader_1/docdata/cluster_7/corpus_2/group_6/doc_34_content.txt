It's a bit of a risk to do this, but they could be trying for kudos as you suggest.  If it's a variable rate they can always adjust it a day or two later.      They might be offering it to new lending to entice them in.  If rates don't drop that much, simply adjust the variable rate appropriately.  They'd have lost nothing at all as an application submitted now wouldn't have enough time to settle prior to the next RBA meeting.
