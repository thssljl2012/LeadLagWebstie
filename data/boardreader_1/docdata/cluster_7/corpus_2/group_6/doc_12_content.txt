      Both Citi and BOA are in trouble again today.  Frankly, considering the futher decline of the global macroeconomic conditions, heightened decline of housing prices, continued job losses, and the DOW appears poised to go to the low 7,000, ... there is the potientiality that this situation is becoming "catastrophic" or a modern day depression.  I don't believe in trickle down economics in a good way, but I do believe it in a bad way.  This is an adverse feedback loop in which all of the above factors are making the total condition worse and worse each day.  At this point, I would be shocked if the economy trends upward any sooner than the 2nd quarter of 2010.
