Just read that article as well      throw these into the mix and its an interesting year ahead       Inflation indicator slumps to fresh low            Quote:                         A KEY measure of annual inflation has fallen to a three and a half year low, igniting concerns about deflation in 2009.    The TD Securities-Melbourne Institute inflation gauge for December fell by 0.2 per cent, following a 0.6 per cent fall in November.      The inflation gauge has now declined for three consecutive months for the first time since the series began in 2002, with falls in petrol, fruit and vegetable prices driving the latest monthly decline.      Annually, the inflation gauge measure grew by 2.2 per cent, the lowest rate of increase since May 2005, and substantially below the peak of 4.8 per cent in June 2008.      TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said deflation, a situation in which prices fall overall, would be a bigger threat than inflation in 2009.      "The TD-MI inflation gauge confirms the transition from a high inflation environment, which was evident in the period up to mid-2008, to a position now where inflation is well contained and squarely within the range of the Reserve Bank of Australia," he said.      "The momentum of prices suggests that deflation risks rather than concern about inflation could be more pronounced in the first half of 2009."      The annual inflation gauge has fallen below the mid-point of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2 to 3 per cent target for the first time since May 2005.      Mr Williamson said this meant the RBA would be likely to cut the official cash rate in February by 75 basis points to 3.5 per cent, the lowest level since early 1965.      "Any downside in these inflation results or to the domestic or global data could see a more aggressive rate reduction," he said.      Falling petrol, fruit and vegetable prices pulled down the inflation gauge measure for December.      These falls were offset by rising rents and holiday accommodation prices.      La Trobe University economics and finance professor Don Harding said based on recent inflation gauge measures, the consumer price index (CPI) for the December quarter would fall by 0.45 per cent.      Headline CPI rose by 1.2 per cent in the September quarter for an annual rate of 5 per cent.      CPI data for the December quarter is due out next week, with the RBA's next board meeting to be held on February 3.                      Freeze on mortgage funds 'to last year'            Quote:                         THE 250,000 investors with more than $25 billion tied up in the frozen mortgage funds sector are unlikely to see their cash until at least next year, with not one fund being unfrozen since the sector was ravaged in October.       Property Investment Research associate director Dugald Higgins said those mortgage funds would unfreeze assets only when investor sentiment in financial markets improved substantially, and no freezes were likely to be lifted until at least 2010.       "Nothing really has changed since the rush of freezing activity in October," Mr Higgins told The Australian.       "The fund's managers will have decided it's best to keep these funds frozen because as soon as they unfreeze them, investors will start rushing out the door again."       In October, more than 30 mortgage and property funds froze investment redemptions after a run on non-bank deposits was sparked by a Federal Government move to guarantee bank deposits amid the financial market turmoil.       Mortgage funds, typically popular with conservative investors seeking a steady income stream, operate by raising money from investors and on-lending the money at higher rates to businesses such as property developers.       Because most of the money raised by the funds is on-lent, those funds are relatively illiquid and are forced to suspend redemptions if there is a surge in applications.       The $2.8 billion Challenger Howard Mortgage became the first major mortgage fund to suspend redemptions in early October, following a spike in redemption applications.       Challenger was followed by more than 30 mortgage and property funds, which froze in excess of $25 billion owned by about 250,000 investors across the nation.       A Challenger spokesman said the company had no immediate plans to lift the fund's freeze, but the group would this week begin to make some payments to investors.       The funds available for distribution were loans that had been repaid by borrowers in recent months, but the amount of the current distribution was yet to be finalised.       "Just like some of the other funds, we will be offering investors a redemption window, and that offer is expected to be finalised (this) week," the spokesman said.       Fellow mortgage fund giants Perpetual, which has about $2 billion worth of funds frozen, and Colonial First State, which holds $3.3 billion of frozen funds, have each made small distributions to investors in recent weeks.       Mr Higgins said the major mortgage funds would probably move to unfreeze the funds at roughly the same time, with the decision to lift the freeze relying heavily on the investment climate.       "How long we are going to be waiting around for that is a fairly open-ended question," he said.       "We are not picking a sustained recovery in the share market or unlisted property funds until at least 2010.
