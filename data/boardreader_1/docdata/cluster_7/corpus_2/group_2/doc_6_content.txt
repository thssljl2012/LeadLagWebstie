         Would welcome any current thoughts on this one, either now or after their trading statement on Monday.  Price is 375p (trending lower)... Historic yield 6.4% (44c/24p) covered 2.1 times, Forecast div is 25.77p to March 09 (cover 1.7 times), then 29.48p to 2010.  Dividend history looks pretty good (all these based on Digitallook).  I&amp;#039;m slightly heavy in Barclays, equalweight in L&amp;amp;amp;G but no other financials in a 13-share HYP portfolio still in the construction phase.  Many thanks  Chris
