Hi.  I disagree with Claymore and others.  It may not have anything to do with reserve requirements.  There is a strong rumour on the financial markets that Old Mutual are facing the global financial crunch.  They, like other insurers are quickly falling short of cash.  They have an option: to sell off Nedbank and raise a a quick R 20 - 30 billion.  Nedbank valued at R 40 - 50 billion.  The registrar wasn&amp;#039;t too happy the last time when ABSA and Barclays came together and they are unlikely to be happy with banks merging in SA.  But if OM is under pressure, they have no option but to avert a financial crisis by letting one of the other three take over Nedbank.  At the moment Standard Bank is rumoured to be the buyer.  They&amp;#039;ve just had a cash injection from China and have about R 10 - 12 million in cash handy.  This is a contrast to the 1999 takeover bid by Nedbank.  Let&amp;#039;s wait and see ... any bets???
