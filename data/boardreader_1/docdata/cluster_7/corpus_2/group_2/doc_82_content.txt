    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Anecdote 2.0   FWIW --    candles:  I can guarantee you that one of the reasons Merrill sold today (BOA&amp;#039;s price must have been subsidized under the table somehow) was because they needed to hide some of LEH&amp;#039;s counter-party risk on someone else&amp;#039;s balance sheet....    candle&amp;#039;s interlocutor:  I certainly agree that counter-party risk is at ther heart of it all.  That JPM bought Bear to cover its own positions opposite Bear in CDS&amp;#039; isn&amp;#039;t just a theory to me--I&amp;#039;ve seen some of evidence, though I can&amp;#039;t get into specifics.     Here&amp;#039;s the important thing to know:  credit default swaps are one of the primary so-called &amp;quot;credit enhancements&amp;quot; that MBS&amp;#039;s use to ingratiate themselves to the ratings agencies, and thus earn that vaunted triple-A rating, which of course is now a joke.  Theoretically, these swaps are to serve as a hedge against losses on the loans underlying the MBS, but as you well know, the CDS are themselves frought with risk because of the nature of the market in which they are bought and sold.  From what I&amp;#039;ve seen, it is quite customary for insurers and commercial banks to take the other side of those CDS that investment banks enter to hedge the MBS they issue (and oh boy did they issue TONS of that sh*t over the last few years).  So, as you surmise, it is quitely likely that BOA is a counterparty to a lot of LEH CDS.  Barclays probably has a lot of skin in the game as well, which is why they were the first to line up as bidders.     The scary thing about all this is that a huge number of pay-option ARMs, which didn&amp;#039;t get issued en masse until 2006, haven&amp;#039;t reached the end of the option term yet, and won&amp;#039;t until 2009-2010.  In the meantime, these damn things arenegatively amortizing!  Which means that when the borrowers holding these things begine to default--andso many surely willbecause the payment increases on these instruments are much steeper than regular ARMs--their losses on a per loan basis will be greater than what we&amp;#039;ve seen thus far, causing evengreater write-downs.  Anyone who tells you that the worst is behind us has no clue what they are talking about.      (P.S. Please don&amp;#039;t repost or spread this about.  Thanks.)          thread start
