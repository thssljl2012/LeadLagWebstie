 From Adrian Ash:                                              Quote:                   US Treasury bond yields crept higher as Wednesday&amp;#039;s &amp;amp;quot;safe haven&amp;amp;quot; panic subsided, but three-month notes still offered just 0.03% to new buyers  up from yesterday&amp;#039;s six-decade low of 0.003%, the lowest level since the London Blitz drove investment cash to seek shelter in government debt across the Atlantic.                                             and                                              Quote:                   Meantime in London, ETFS Ltd.  the market-leading issuer of exchange-traded commodity note (ETCs)  said it was &amp;amp;quot;trying to get market makers back in the market&amp;amp;quot; after they stopped making prices in response to the collapse of American insurance giant AIG.      &amp;amp;quot;We can give no assurance as to whether these...alternatives can be implemented at this stage,&amp;amp;quot; said the chairman, Graham Turkwell, on a conference call this morning.      He stressed that the loss of liquidity in ETFS&amp;#039;s so-called classic, forward, inverse and leveraged DJ-AIG commodity index notes has &amp;amp;quot;absolutely nothing to do with the metal or oil securities&amp;amp;quot; such as its Gold ETF.
