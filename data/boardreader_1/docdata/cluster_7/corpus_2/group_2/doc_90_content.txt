   Margareta Pagano: Qatar is the new Venice and London has missed the boat         After losing out on a partnership deal, the LSE could fall prey to the ambitious emirate       Sunday, 29 June 2008         Is Qatar set to be the new Venice? Like the Adriatic port in the 15th century, Qatar has big ambitions, a tiny population, many islands and huge wealth.      At one stage Venice had 3,000 trading ships, 300 navy vessels and was the richest and greatest trading port in the world. Qatar may not have the ships but instead it has a subterranean wealth of natural resources: about a third of the world&amp;#039;s total gas reserves lie within the emirate. Much of the money it makes from gas is pumped into the Qatar Investment Authority, which is creating a fascinating portfolio of investments around the world, ranging from the London Stock Exchange to last week&amp;#039;s stake-buying in Barclays bank.      Even more intriguing is the ambition of Sheikh Hamad al-Thani, the ruler of Qatar who wants it to become the leading entrept of the Middle East  a mecca for companies seeking to raise capital and develop their local economies. It was a mark of his grand vision that he pulled off such a sensational deal with the NYSE Euronext stock market last week.      In a masterstroke of geopolitical manoeuvring, Qatar&amp;#039;s stock market, the Doha Securities Market, brought the New York exchange in as a partner to buy a 25 per cent stake for $250m (around 125m). The two will work together to build a new integrated cash and derivatives exchange in the capital, and so in one swoop Qatar will get all the latest technology, the know-how and a platform to fulfil its ambition to become the main capital centre of the Middle East. It also wants local investors, which is why it&amp;#039;s planning to sell some of its own shares in an IPO within the next three years.      Doha already has 43 listed companies with a market value of $136bn, but it wants to grow faster to beat Dubai and be the Gulf&amp;#039;s main liquidity pool.      Over the past few months, Qatar has been running a beauty parade for the world&amp;#039;s exchanges: the contestants included the LSE, Deutsche Brse, NYSE and a couple of others. It was quite clear what it wanted from a prospective partner: long-term commitment, a manager who could build and oversee the Doha platform, intellectual capital, and the kind of wealth that would help the Doha market do future deals  like a bid for its rival in Dubai, say. The little matter of the dowry was the easy part.      The NYSE was the obvious partner. It has all those attributes and it already has the experience of integrating exchanges across Europe through Euronext.      What is devastating for the UK is that Dame Clara Furse of the LSE couldn&amp;#039;t or wouldn&amp;#039;t make all those commitments, even though chairman Chris Gibson-Smith is close to the Qataris  so close that he brought them in as a big investor last year to rescue the exchange from Nasdaq&amp;#039;s bid.      I am loath to say it again but the LSE really does look as though it is losing opportunities  and in doing so, it is starting to look careless. Apart from the lack of a proper derivatives market, the LSE could have been the beauty queen. But for whatever reason, Dame Clara was not able to clinch a deal. Once again she has been trumped by that wily operator Jean-Franois Thodore, the deputy chief of NYSE Euro- next who beat her to Liffe a few years ago.      But back to Doha, where the exchange is just one part of Qatar&amp;#039;s plan to diversify away from natural resources and create its own dynamic private sector for when the gas runs out or prices collapse. For now, though, the Qatar economy is rattling along like a train: it&amp;#039;s going to grow at 10 per cent per annum over the next five years and beyond that at 7 per cent. Current GDP is estimated at some $64bn. The ruling al-Thani family is a modernising one: there are plans to invest $130bn in the country&amp;#039;s health and education and to back local enterprise.      Skyscrapers are the chosen temples to the new wealth, just as the Venetians built their palaces and bridges. There are other links to the Adriatic port: next to St Mark&amp;#039;s Cathedral, you can still see the Fresco of Islamic Traders. Then the Arabs were one of Venice&amp;#039;s biggest trading partners  big importers of glass and diamonds coming out of the city. Today the dynamics are not much different but the political challenges are greater.      If Qatari money and vision, coupled with US-Franco know-how, can bring stability to the Middle East by spreading wealth and opening local economies, then this could be a spectacular turning point in the region. But how long before they turn their sights towards London?
