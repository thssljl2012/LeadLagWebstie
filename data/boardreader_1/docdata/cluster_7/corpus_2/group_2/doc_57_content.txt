&amp;gt;                             Quite true ... but here is the WSJ on the story. Appears that I was wrong about my initial assessment. Temasek actually may end up making money on this investment thanks to the BoA acquisition coming well above Friday&amp;#039;s closing price.   FROM WSJ:  Developments on Wall Street over the weekend are no doubt turning some investors red in the face. Temasek Holdings finds itself in a position that should make them green with envy. It is part luck and part smart risk management.  Temasek paid $48 a share for Merrill Lynch when it first bought the stock back in December, but downside protections built into its agreement with Merrill effectively halved the purchase price to around $24 a share in July.  With Merrill&amp;#039;s shares down to $17.05 on Friday, even that was a money-losing position. But with Bank of America now making an offer for Merrill that values the stock at $29, Temasek could still walk away from its foray into the toxic U.S. financial-services industry smelling like roses.  Temasek remains vulnerable if Bank of America&amp;#039;s share price falls in the weeks ahead, cutting the price Temasek and other Merrill shareholders will get. It&amp;#039;ll have to drop more than 17% before Temasek starts losing money on its position -- certainly not out of the question.  Still, anything less drastic means Temasek has the luxury of starting with a clean slate as it decides whether it wants to own a stake in Bank of America. Such a switch would shift its exposure away from Wall Street and more toward Main Street, with a more direct involvement in the U.S. commercial-banking, credit-card and mortgage markets. In the U.K., Temasek owns 19% of Standard Chartered and a small stake in Barclays.
