 SNG Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              OT:  Beware Exchange Traded Notes(ETN&amp;#039;s)   Quite a while back there was a discussion here on the merits of owning Exchange Traded Funds(ETFs) versus owning Exchange Traded Notes(ETNs). Over&amp;amp;nbsp; time...I have owned/traded many of each.&amp;amp;nbsp; Given the size of the investment houses offering ETN&amp;#039;s...I never thought embedded credit issues with the issuer would become an issue.&amp;amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;#000000&amp;quot; face=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp; Barclays...which runs many iPath ETN&amp;#039;s...has apparently come out and said it will not assume trading Lehman ETN&amp;#039;s which likely relegates them to general obligations of Lehman which likely will trade alongside Lehman debt...somewhere around 15-20 cents on the dollar. Lehman&amp;#039;s ETNs trade under RAW...EOH...PPE.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; DGP and DGZ from Powershares are ETN&amp;#039;s as well.&amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;#000000&amp;quot; face=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;ETNs do not invest in  the index they track, but promise to pay the returns of that index. The  exposure is to the issuing bank, so the security of the investment  depends on the security of that bank.  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  ETFs, by contrast, usually hold the underlying securities of the  index they are tracking, and must do so in the US. Under European  rules, they can also use derivatives to track an index, but must hold a  minimum of 90 per cent of the fund as collateral. This limits any  counter-party loss to a maximum of 10 per cent.  &amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;#000000&amp;quot; face=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;gt;
