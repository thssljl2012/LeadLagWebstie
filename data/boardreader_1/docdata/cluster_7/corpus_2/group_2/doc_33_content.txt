          Barclays managed to avoid buying ABN   This is like suggesting there are olympic losers who skillfully and intentionally &amp;#039;managed to avoid&amp;#039; coming first.  Reality check: Barclays were desperate to take ABN at a huge price almost identical to what RBS paid - except they wanted  the whole thing  - not just 1/3 of it.    it looks as if they have cherry picked Lehman&amp;#039;s US business   The wording here is... unusual. Barclays didn&amp;#039;t just rush in because they saw a bargain. They WERE rushed in because they were a counterparty to Lehmans as much as anything else. Indeed they very nearly bought the entire company just a day before it folded. That&amp;#039;s the fact of it. Check where the CEO of Barclays was the day before Lehman&amp;#039;s folded - considering buying the thing for a hefty sum!   This argument is attributing skill where in fact there is simply an ability to fail to execute in the actions they have been  clearly  trying to take.  If you don&amp;#039;t think Barclays was actively trying to acquire the entirety of ABN and the entirety of Lehmans at what turned out to be the worst possible time and for what would have been gigantic sums of money, then it will be hard for us to continue to discuss this, as I perceive this as well-established and generally-accepted fact.    1. It bought the wrong bank and fouled up its capital base and damaged its potential future return on capital - so what if it makes ?9bn per year, if it needs twice as much capital to do so then value has been destroyed.   Demonstratably wrong, unfortunately. The intention was not to continue to earn 9bn but to improve earnings and this is well on course. Factually it does not require twice the capital to do so. I calculated that by selling shares to take up the rights issue when it was announced, you faced a dilution of equity of *20%*. Similarly compare the 12bn raised against RBS&amp;#039;s net current shareholder equity - 58 bn. 12bn / 58bn is not &amp;#039;0.5&amp;#039;, contrary to your stated views.    http://www.investors.rbs.com/investor_relations/announcement...   (this is recent as of 2 weeks ago!)    As for &amp;#039;wrong bank&amp;#039;, this is purely your own speculation. Please don&amp;#039;t present it as fact in this argument. We&amp;#039;ll all know if it was the wrong bank or not in 2010 when the integration is complete, and not before.    3. Like other UK banks, it does have exposure to the UK mortgage market.   So RBS is just like other UK banks...   HBOS is a UK specific bank focussing on UK deposits and lending, it does not compete in RBS international or capital markets space. Same goes for BB. They are not better banks, but nor are they RBS&amp;#039;s peers.   ...except when it&amp;#039;s inconvenient to your earlier argument. :-)  comp.  p.s. I reposted because my earlier post was unnecessarily hostile to you. I apologise for that. It&amp;#039;s been an exciting day and I was feeling a bit gladiatorial. Genuine thanks to whoever reported the first version as OTT! :-)
