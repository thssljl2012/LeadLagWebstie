   But why is it so much more widespread is the question SF. $700 B is a huge number, a much bigger number than I can come up with on defaulted and defaulting mortgages       This is not just mortgages in default or foreclosure. There are also mortgages that are behind in payments, and also houses with mortgages that are higher than the market value of the house.       The only possible explanation I can think of is the the bundling trick means that all the mortgages are considered bad paper so all of them have to be covered because investor&amp;#039;s will not buy any of them. If that is the case maybe someone should make them go through the paper and separate out the subprime, ARM, no doc loans.    The pooling/bundling of mortgages into securities is exactly this.    Individual mortgage pools, are sliced into what is called &amp;quot;tranches&amp;quot;.    Some tranches have no risk and contain mortgages where the borrower is qualified and put a lot of cash down on the house.    Then further granularity goes all the way down to the interest only loans and the loans where the borrower is not required to show their W2 forms. These are the riskiest tranches, which in turn were insured by AIG.   These tranches are bought up by insurance companies to create income streams; pension funds, endowments, mutual funds, etc, to create fixed income allocations in their portfolios. Even money market funds purchase short term paper and discount notes in FNMA/FHLMC.
