 DCTH Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              stock price and fundamentals   Good call, the story is tracking as expected.  I thought that they were slightly ahead of reasonable expectations on both enrollments (40) and number of activated sites (6 of 8).  We&amp;#039;ll probably get to 50% enrollment by December and full enrollment in May of 2009.  All this suggests FDA filing for approval by the end of 2009.      The stock price is another issue.  If we exclude Barclays (index fund), then we&amp;#039;re down to 5 institutional shareholders of size.  Given the recent evidence of selling by Winslow and Citadel, I suspect that we&amp;#039;re now down to just 3-4 institutional shareholders.  That&amp;#039;s why the stock is down.  Trying to tie daily stock price swings to fundamentals will drive you crazy.  At this level, I don&amp;#039;t think the markets are particularly efficient i.e. the DCTH tree has fallen in the forest and there is no one there to hear it.      I think that everyone here will agree that the recent news flow and fundamentals are good enough to justify a much higher stock price.  The stock will not go up until these guys get some new investors.      While the conference call was a step in the right direction, I still think that Taney has not done a good job dealing with investors.  Remember the last conference call was six months ago!  I believe they&amp;#039;ve attended 2 investor conferences in the past year.      Hopefully the hiring of new investor relations and pr firms will mark an improvement.  Sure some of the blame is the weak market, but I say look in the mirror first.
