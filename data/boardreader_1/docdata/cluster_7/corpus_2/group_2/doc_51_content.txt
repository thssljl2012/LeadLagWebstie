Several years ago I questioned when this was all going to come to a head and as far back as when I got the mortgage on my house (10 years ago) I was well aware of the issues relating to subprime loans and teaser rates vs fixed interest.      Of course most of these companies bought the mortgage packages from other originators. The real fault rests with those who were willing to lend risky money because THEY didn&amp;#039;t have to carry the paper. Let greed get its reward!                      It took various breakdowns in fiduciary duty to get us here.  Bond rating agencies whose reputations depend on predicting default risk properly for the benefit of bond buyers also depend on bond issuers for their revenue.  Who do you think got the benefit of the doubt?      Risk managers, relying on the rating agencies, focused on turning over lower-rated CDOs, blithely warehousing the AAA tranches (and collecting the positive carry) in the mistaken belief that they were limiting their risk.  If everybody else wasn&amp;#039;t doing the exact same thing, they probably would have been correct.      Traders and CEOs are theoretically paid to optimize the balance between risk and reward.  In fact, their incentive is to create as much profit as possible regardless of the risk, as long as the risk manager lets them get away with it.  And revenue-producing traders generally have more sway then overhead-producing risk managers.      The answer for regulators, in my opinion, is to increase transparency, perhaps by requiring centralized clearing of derivatives similar to the way exchange-listed contracts clear.  That would remove most of the counter-party and &amp;amp;quot;systemic&amp;amp;quot; risk that is driving the bailouts.  Less opaque financial statements would help too (remember the off-balance-sheet SIVs?).  Although some observers are blaming mark-to-market accounting for the crisis, it is actually part of the solution, but it should be tweaked to allow for liquidity reserves.  More centralized regulation in the United States, more in line with world standards, could probably overhaul regulation without placing a greater burden on financial companies.
