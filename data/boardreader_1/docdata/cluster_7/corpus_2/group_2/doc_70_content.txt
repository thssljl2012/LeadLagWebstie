 LINE Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              LEH overhang still an issue   LINE cleared up the potential loss on hedges with Lehman, but Lehman still/may hold millions of units.  Question is will Barclays own these along with the commodities futures trading division, keep these units, sell, etc.    At some point it isn&amp;#039;t worth it for BCS to sell, but if they don&amp;#039;t own these units they will be liquidated.  A similar issue exists with NeubergerBerman&amp;#039;s MLP holdings.    Morgan Stanley hasn&amp;#039;t stopped falling today and they are also holding MLP&amp;#039;s.    All of the analysts&amp;#039; reports say nothing is wrong and this is a great time to buy some select MLPs, but the pps keeps falling.  Note that if you want distribution growth, LINE may not provide much of this and faces competition with the likes of ETE, MWE, etc. who are presenting with great current yields and future distribution growth (even if it may be cut in half for the next few years).    2.32 million units traded in short time yesterday at $15/unit and now 3.5 million just traded at $14/unit?  Assuming Lehman had $365 million at $25/unit then that would be roughly 14.6 million units.  Potentially there are 8.78 million units to be dumped (if this is what is happening).    Movements of LINE can also be tracked against APL and I&amp;#039;m looking for any large deviation in pps and/or volume.    Not trying to buy at the bottom, but rather on the way back up seems more prudent.  Though a 20% yield for LINE has a limit order with my name on it.    Cheers,
