Trader Tracks Situational Alert 09-26-08 09:30 AM   NO TRADES RECOMMENDED TODAY    The POTENTIAL GOLD breakout has been confirmed by more charts and technicals this am.  I expect a major 3 wave move of 50 to 150 points. The high this fall for gold should be 985 to 1040. The WaMu failure last night was expected but when they arrive its always a surprise- JP Morgan Chase got the bank with 2,300 west coast branches where they did not have a presence- this bank is now number 2 in national size.     The gold real time Dec. futures day chart is forming a continuation triangle from which we get big rallies. I think it comes next week - Barclays reported gold is showing positive pressure against all major currencies including the euro. I think the gold rally could be fast and huge. Key dates for major market changes are today with dow futures down huge on the pre-market open 740 am on no offered resolution to the mess on credit in usa.     Critical dates are 10-3, 10-7 and 10-15. These dates can be major stock market failure days and/or major selling dollar and rallying gold days.  That is our next shorter term forecast. The PPT is desperate to hold the Dow above 10,000; thus intervention hits hard at 10,400-10,500 to prevent the slide. If 10,000 breaks, support is 9750 followed by 9250.     There is going to be one or two very nasty down days in October and the PPT will do their best to prop for elections. I do not expect any PPT gold selling as the gold price is contained beneath the former highs. PM shares are beginning to move but the late summer wounding will defer more major gains until after xmas. THE NEXT BIG NEWS WE PREDICT IS THE WORST RETAIL XMAS BUYING IN MANY YEARS. THIS WILL DISAPPOINT.    Roger Wiegand  Editor Trader Tracks Newsletter      The Jay &amp;amp;amp; Rog Blog at   http://www.webeatthestreet.com
