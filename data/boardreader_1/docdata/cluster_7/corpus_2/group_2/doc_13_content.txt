 of course not, not if funding costs trend up again.   Thems the risk you take with variable mortgage rates.   People have forgoten over the last 10yrs  the spread between RBA rates and variable rates has consistantly dropped.   Look back at the 80&amp;#039;s and 90&amp;#039;s and i think you will see we still have MUCH lower spreads.   If history reverts back to the norm, then expect the spread to increase.      People forget that in the last few years the spread on derivative insurance was incredibly low (and hence why AIG went under it was pricing risk based on recent low volatility history!!!).  This enabled securitisation of assets with very low spreads.   Given the blow up on all of this i dont really think you will see such narrow spreads in the near future.
