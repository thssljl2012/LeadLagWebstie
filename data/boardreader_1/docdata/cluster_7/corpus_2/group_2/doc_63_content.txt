This won&amp;#039;t help the big banks or insurance companies like AIG though.  This is just one more loss they are going to have to eat.  I think a big part of Friday&amp;#039;s rally was the mistaken perception that the preferred holders would be protected.  That has not only gone away, but the situation has become much worse.   Look at what happened to FNM and FRE share prices during regular trading Friday.  The inside traders had high hopes that the Federal Government was going to make everything better for everybody.  The fine print doesn&amp;#039;t support that theory.    We may still see a rally in financials tomorrow, but the bottom line is that this doesn&amp;#039;t help them much at all.  For most of them, it actually makes things worse.      thread start
