The TED spread, which is the difference between the three month Treasury bill and the three month Libor -- spiked to its highest level since the crisis began, indicating tighter credit conditions.  To prevent an AIG bankruptcy filing, the Federal Reserve agreed to provide a $85 billion two-year loan in exchange for a 79.9% stake in the insurance giant.  The Fed felt a disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility.  In attempt to quell some fears, Morgan Stanley (MS 24.52, -4.20) announced its third quarter earnings a day early.  The company earned $1.32 per share, which blew past expectations by $0.54.  Despite the earnings beat, the stock is trading 14.5% lower as Morgan Stanley&amp;#039;s credit default swap -- which is the cost to protect debt -- traded at 728 yesterday.  By comparison, Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; (LEH 0.17, -0.13) swap traded at 707 before it filed bankruptcy.

By comparison, Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; (LEH) swap traded at 707 before it filed bankruptcy.  There is also concern with the TED spread -- the difference between three month Treasury bill and three month Libor -- spiking 30% to 2.83%, which is a higher spread than when Bear Stearns collapsed.
