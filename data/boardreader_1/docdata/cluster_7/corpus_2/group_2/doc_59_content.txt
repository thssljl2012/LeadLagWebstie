         &amp;amp;quot;Dresdner has published a 50 page analysis&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;amp;quot;RBS target 275p&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;amp;quot;RBS is much cheaper: Barclays is much more expensive, valued at 1.7x tangible book value per share versus 1.2x at RBS. While we view Barclays as having a more attractive business mix, we think that the premium is far too high and would expect it to narrow significantly. We see a similar disparity in P/E ratios, with RBS trading at 7.1x 2009E earnings versus 9.9x at Barclays. We have upgraded RBS to Buy (from Add), with a price target of 275p and downgraded Barclays to Reduce (from Hold), with a target price of 350p.   http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/09/23/16230/is-the-crun...
