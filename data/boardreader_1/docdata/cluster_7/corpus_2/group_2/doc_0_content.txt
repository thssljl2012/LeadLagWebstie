 Yet more &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; news (NOT)       Quote:                         NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Vanguard Group Inc., one of the largest U.S. mutual fund managers, said it is confident in the stability of its money market funds, a day after one of the oldest money funds said its net asset value fell below $1 due to huge losses on securities issued by Lehman Brothers (LEH.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz).    &amp;quot;Vanguard is confident in the stability of its money market funds, all of which are managed with the objective of maintaining a stable net asset value of $1 a share,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement on its website on Wednesday.    Money market funds are regarded as super-safe vehicles, buying interest-bearing securities that mature within a year, and frequently within a week or month. Unlike ordinary mutual funds, the net asset value of money market funds are never supposed to fall below $1 a share -- an event known as &amp;quot;breaking the buck.&amp;quot;    Vanguard&amp;#039;s biggest money fund has no exposure to securities issued by Wall Street dealers including Lehman which filed for bankrutcy on Sunday, Vanguard said.    The $106 billion Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund VMMXX.O also do not have holdings in securities issued by insurance giant American International Group (AIG.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), which received a special $85 billion from the U.S. government to keep it afloat on Tuesday.    On Tuesday, the Reserve Primary Fund, a money-market mutual fund whose assets have tumbled 65 percent in recent weeks, fell below $1 a share in net asset value, because of its losses on debt issued by Lehman.    The Reserve Primary Fund had about $23 billion in assets on Tuesday, down from about $65 billion in assets as of Aug. 31, said fund spokesman Ming Lee Hatch.    The fund&amp;#039;s chairman, Bruce Bent, is known as the &amp;quot;father&amp;quot; of money funds, after creating the first money market mutual fund in 1970 with a partner.    Vanguard said its Prime Money Market Fund currently holds more than half of its assets in U.S. Treasuries and securities issued or backed by federal agencies such as Fannie Mae (FNM.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and Freddie Mac (FRE.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz).
