         For STRs but also others, as the banking landscape has now changed....   again...  in rather a big way since I posted this:   http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11226261   Changes are  1. B&amp;amp;amp;B nationalised..  no depositors lost out. 2. All other banks now liable for first 15bln of B&amp;amp;amp;B losses. (said the chancellor on Today this morning)  Normal advice is 35k chunks spread around, but if you think the government will do an equitable if/when a bank does finally go bust then it would seem a case of damage avoidance.
