&amp;gt;                             Mac,  I did not get to respond fully to your earlier post due to an interruption at this end.  You asked me for my take on the collapse of Wall Street banks/bond houses etc? You have since spared me the need by voicing  your own view on the phenomium. I am reluctant to contradict you for I am not knowledgeable enough on the exact relationship between your Fed and the private banks you claim own and operate it. I can only remark that it is the duty of any central bank to maintain the stability of the nation&amp;#039;s currency and the integrity of monetary policy. No central bank should allow itself (or be allowed to) operate monetary policy to favour particular vested interests let alone become captive to them.  If things are as you say then the Fed has been  corrupted and grossly remiss in its duties.  (The probable consequences of that is something I don&amp;#039;t even want to think about)  The first challenge facing America in this time of crisis would seen to be to restore integrity and independence to the Fed.  Can this be done?    Indeed, it seems that a root-and-branch restoration of integrity to the process of government may be needed?  I do not believe that the subprime mortgage debacle could have happened had not slack banking regulations permitted those culpable to loan vast sums of money to mortagees who were unfit to take out mortgage contracts. I get the impression that years ago your banks and finance institutions had exhausted the market in the sense that virtually all solvent would-be borrowers (basically middle class people with steady jobs and some collateral) had already taken out loans and for the sake of prudence wanted no more. So some finance companies succumbed to the temptation of &amp;quot;moving down the food chain&amp;quot; to loan out money to more dodgy customers who normally would not have qualified for mortgasge loans. Gaining market share apparently took precedence over sound banking practice. Such desperate generation of new business  at any cost could only7 have happened within a scenario of excess liquidity (too much money in circulation) combined with slack banking/finance regulations and poor monitorong by the authorities. .....................................  As a digression but only to shed extra light: I recognise that the contagion has spread internationally. Recently I heard of the forced merger of an insolvent British regional bank with a larger bank - weeks ago the UK government had to take over another insolvent bank to protect depositors and other stakeholders. Britain has had a property bubble that resembles America&amp;#039;s. I am keeping a weather eye on the waves as spread globally. Yet I am not being smug when I say that no such occurence has happened here - not yet!  We have had our own (more modest) property boom and subsequent deflation which has caused hardship for a lot of smalltime property investors. Some will probably go, out belly up! However none of our banks or major finance companys show any sign of being in trouble. A couple of our big banks lost money on their involvment in the US subprime market - but their Australian business remains profitable. Consensus of opinion among the experts, both local and international, is that our banking regulations (among the world&amp;#039;s most stringent) have prevented our banking/finance sector from getting into the subprime game. Further, as a land that does not normally attract petrodollars or the offerings of overseas soverign funds there has not been an excess of liquidity in our economy - one reason why local interest rates have been so consistently high. That by itself has tended to screen out would-be &amp;quot;bottom of the ocean&amp;quot; borrowers.  Recalling how our Central Bank (the Reserve Bank of Australia) under the astute leadership of Ian MacPharlaine astutely steered up through the Asian currency crisis of 1997, I can confidently say that our central bank is functioning as the independent regulatory body  it should be.  Government?  With the exception of the recession years of 1990-91, Australian governments have consistently run budget surplusses since 1986. Meaning it has been raking in more in the form of government taxes and charges than they have been spending on all government activities. This means that our government is in the happy position of having NIL debt - for not only have the surplusses ensured that they have not been racking up debt, they have paid off all of the debt incurred by previous generations when governments ran defecits. The consensus is that this country is in a strong position to weather the global storm - given that our government (as a net credator) has ample fiscal reserves to draw upon should circumstances require it to do so! .................................................  Mac, I do not know how well the following unsolicited advice would go mover where you are. I suppose the only way to find out is to air my thoughts.  I forsee higher taxes as both necessary and unavoidable in America.  As someone who does not enjoy the prospect of paying more taxes myself I would normally not make such a recommendation. But the penchant of US governments for running fiscal defecits year after year, administration after administration tells me that your Federal government is not pulling in enough revenue from existing sources.  One can talk of government waste - the squandering of trillions on the likes of the Iraq debacle for example. But even if these costs were eliminated there is still the long postponed needs of American society for inverstment in a national health sceme, public education etc. These will no doubt be on the agenda of the next Democrats administration.  More than that the US government needs the extra revenue to bring your Federal budget into surplus. Not merely to forstall additional national debt (which incurrs an ongoing cost in interest paid and alternative spending sacrificed) but to commence paying off existing debt to relieve the cost burden on future generations.  Americans are (believe it or not) the most lightly taxed people in the OECD group of countries. The flip side of the coin is the debt that US govenrnments bould up as a result of tax revenues falling short of expenditure. Indeed, the willingness of overseas soverign funds to buy up US government debt has possibly (for too long) relieved US administrtations of the need to grasp the politically unpopular nettle of increased taxes.  Do either of the current candidates for President have the strength of character to do it?
