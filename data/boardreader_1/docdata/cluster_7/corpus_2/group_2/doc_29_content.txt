         Steady Aim  you asked for a time when RBS were yielding 16%.  well right now they are yielding 40% but i doubt they will be yielding that for long!  if you think RBS will default then they are obviously not a  good buy. but then if you think that the ordinary shares are also not a good buy at any price!  i think default is extremely unlikely, no more likely than a Barclays or Lloyds default, and if things were to get much worse the government would simply engineer a takeover by HSBC or some other global bank just as they did with  Lloyds and HBOS.   when that happens, the yield on the Prefs will be nearer 8% and the Pref shares will rise about 400%!
