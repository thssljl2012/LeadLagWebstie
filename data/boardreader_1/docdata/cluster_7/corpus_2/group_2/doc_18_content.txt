 CWEI Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 4              Massive Liquidity Injection.......GOLD please..all currencies will be debased   The Federal Reserve and central banks around the world announced additional liquidity injections into the severely strained markets Monday. The massive liquidity injections are taken as short-term funding markets remain under stress.   &amp;quot;Central banks will continue to work together closely and are prepared to take appropriate steps as needed to address funding pressures,&amp;quot; the Fed said in a statement.     There will be a sizeable increase in swap limits with a number of central banks, including the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, National Bank of Denmark, European Central Bank, Bank of Norway, Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank of Sweden, and Swiss National Bank. As of Monday, swap lines have been opened to a total of $620 billion, from $290 billion previously.       &amp;quot;We will continue to adapt these liquidity facilities as necessary and will keep them in place as long as circumstances require,&amp;quot; the Fed added.     Anxious investors and the tight credit markets sent the Dow down over 300 points in early trading Monday. All eyes have not been on Wall Street, however, but rather on Washington as Congress prepares to vote on the highly sensitive $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.     &amp;quot;By committing to provide a very large quantity of term funding, the Federal Reserve actions should reassure financial market participants that financing will be available against good collateral, lessening concerns about funding and rollover risk,&amp;quot; the statement read.     In addition to more than doubling the swap lines, the Federal Reserve tripled the supply of 84-day maturity credit available through the Term Auction Facility to $225 billion from $75 billion. TAF credit at the 28-day maturity will remain at $75 billion, meaning that the total amount of TAF credit available in the 28-day and 84-day auction cycles will double to $300 billion from $150 billion.     Although collectively the increase means an additional $330 billion open for swap lines, individually the numbers break down in $30 billion by the Bank of Canada, $80 billion by the Bank of England, $120 billion by the Bank of Japan, $15 billion by the National bank of Denmark, $240 billion by the ECB, $15 billion by the Bank of Norway, $30 billion by the Reserve Bank of Australia, $30 billion by the Bank of Sweden, and $60 billion by the Swiss National Bank. These swap facilities have been authorized through April 30, 2009.
