         EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS (ETFS GOLDS)  I ALWAYS THOUGHT ETFs WERE SIMPLE.  ANYONE READ THIS WEEK&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;MONEY WEEK&amp;#039; PAGE 14 BY DAVID STEVENSON?  CONFUSED - I AM !  I HAVE MONEY IN &amp;#039;ETFs GOLDS&amp;#039; - ISIN - GB00B15KXX56. SYMBOL = BULP (BUL ISE) - EXCHANGE TRADED COMMODITY - LSE DOMESTIC QUOTES (SORRY ABOUT ALL THAT DETAIL)  ANYWAY, TRADING IN MY GOLD INVESTMENTS WERE SUSPENDED LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM WITH AIG USA.   TRADING NOW STARTED AGAIN.  IT SEEMS I HAVE PICKED THE WRONG TYPE OF ETF TO BUY.  THEO CASEY OF FLEET STREET LETTER EXPLAINS THERE ARE SAFE ETFs (CASH-BASED), ISSUED BY BARCLAYS GLOBAL INVESTORS, AND THERE ARE &amp;#039;ETF SECURITIES WHICH ARE NOT SO SAFE.  AS MY INVESTMENT WAS SUSPENDED I ASSUME I HAVE THE DODGY ETF.  THINKING NOW OF SELLING THEM AND REPLACING WITH THE SAFE ETF (CASH-BASED) BUT CANNOT FIND WHERE TO BUY.  ANYONE KNOW?   BARCLAYS GLOBAL INVESTORS DO NOT INCLUDE GOLD AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.  RAY
