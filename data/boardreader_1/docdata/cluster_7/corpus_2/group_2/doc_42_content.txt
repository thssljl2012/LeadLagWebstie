       =DJ Fannie Mae Sells Record $7B 2-Yr Notes Amid Strong Demand  .    By Anusha Shrivastava    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES      NEW YORK(Dow Jones)--Fannie Mae (FNM) sold a record $7 billion of two-year notes Wednesday to eager investors whose confidence in the troubled housing finance company has been buoyed by the government&amp;#039;s bailout over the weekend.     The notes received more than $9 billion worth of orders, according to sources familiar with the deal, helping to push down the financing costs on the notes.     &amp;amp;quot;The deal is a spectacular success,&amp;amp;quot; said Rajiv Setia, an agency strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. &amp;amp;quot;It got an overwhelming response.&amp;amp;quot;     U.S. investors snatched 63% of the note, while Asian investors bought 12%, which though low in percentage terms, is about the same in dollar terms as their purchases of previous deals.     The warm reception the deal received has encouraged FHLBank Systems, another government-sponsored enterprise, to offer a $3 billion five-year note, according to William O&amp;#039;Donnell, head of U.S. interest rate strategy and research with UBS in Stamford, Conn.     FHLB officials didn&amp;#039;t return phone calls seeking comment on on its offering.     Fannie decided to come with a record-sized offering to satisfy investor demand, Setia noted, adding that some investors bought billion-dollar chunks. Fund managers bought 54% of the notes and central banks bought another 27%.     &amp;amp;quot;Without a doubt, it&amp;#039;s a vote of confidence,&amp;amp;quot; said William O&amp;#039;Donnell, head of U.S. interest rate strategy and research with UBS in Stamford, Conn.      The debt was sold at 70 basis points over comparable Treasurys, to yield 2.896%. &amp;amp;quot;Spreads were very attractive for investors,&amp;amp;quot; said Jim Vogel, an analyst at FTN Financial.     Fannie had sold $6 billion in two-year notes in June 2002 at a yield of 3.103%. In July of this year, Fannie&amp;#039;s sold $3 billion of two-year notes at a yield of 3.272%. Asian investors bought 39% of the debt.     Its short-term bill auction, also held Wednesday, did well, too, selling at a yield that was as much as 50 basis points tighter to Fannie&amp;#039;s issue last week. The $1 billion, three-month bill sold at 2.18%, about 44 basis points tighter to comparable Treasurys. The $1 billion, six-month bill sold at 2.408%, about 53 basis points tighter to comparative Treasurys.     Questions Remain About Longer-Term      While investors are flocking to buy short-term debt from Fannie since the government&amp;#039;s support became clearer, it remains to be seen if they will have the same level of confidence in buying debt that matures beyond two years.     Given the uncertainty around the shape of Fannie and Freddie beyond the initial phase when the Treasury Department is backing it, investors may yet hold back.     &amp;amp;quot;Asia will take a wait-and-see approach but they will come back,&amp;amp;quot; Setia said, adding that this time round, the overwhelming response the deal got from domestic investors seems to have crowded out overseas buyers.     &amp;amp;quot;The dollar volume of their purchase is in line with the past,&amp;amp;quot; he added.     -By Anusha Shrivastava, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2371; anusha.shrivastava@dowjones.com       Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today&amp;#039;s most important business and market news, analysis and commentary:  http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=BmB6zJwi0pQvKogVShuQ5A%3D%3D .
