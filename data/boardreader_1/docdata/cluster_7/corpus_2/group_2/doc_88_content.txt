Unfortunately, I don&amp;#039;t know the answer, but here are a few of the trends I am seeing.  The discussion thread has been around AIG.  A lot of insurance companies are trading well below net tangible assets and have been for the past year.  Another observation is that Chinese stocks look really cheap.  Personally, I hate buying Chinese stocks (have I mentioned that before?), but there are some incredibly cheap Chinese stocks.  CHTF, ETLT.OB, NWD, and FFHL all trade below a P/E of 4.  Three of these companies are cash rich.  The overall Chinese market has been the worst performer in the world since 2003 despite the overall economy growing rapidly.  My fear on Chinese stocks is around fraud: &amp;quot;The return on your money is not as important as the return of your money.&amp;quot;  Despite this fear, I&amp;#039;m buying stock in a few Chinese companies.  One other stock I have bought recently is Surgutneftegaz Preferred shares (SGTPY).  The stock has a dividend yield around 10% and changes with company profits.  Surgutneftegaz is a murky Russian oil company, but they are very profitable (P/E=5) and cash rich ($12B in cash).  I&amp;#039;ve owned common shares for 10 years.    Overall, I see lots of bargains out there.  I just need more cash.       thread start
