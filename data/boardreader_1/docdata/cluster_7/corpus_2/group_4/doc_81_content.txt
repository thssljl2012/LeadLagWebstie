Dear All,       1.  Despite the RBA maintaining a steady interest rate policy in April 2008, from my own reading, I understand that  the various State Economies  in  NSW, Victoria and even Queensland, are now at the verge of falling into a Recession soon.      2. ANZ Bank is now said to be forceasting an interest rate cut by the RBA, as early as 2009, instead of from mid-2009 period, as it has previously forecasted.      3. It has been further suggested that the international immigration figures has more or less peaked around 187,000 per year during last June 2007 and that the Australian &amp;#039;s low unemployment rate has more or less bottomed out at around 4%p.a recently, as per the following news-report,  &amp;amp;quot; Labour booms bottoms out as jobless rate increases&amp;amp;quot;.    http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/arti...856768083.html          4. For your kind confirmation and further comments/discussion, please.      5. Thank you.      Cheers,   Kenneth KOH
