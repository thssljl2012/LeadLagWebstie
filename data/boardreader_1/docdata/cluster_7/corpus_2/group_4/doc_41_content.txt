Australia Slashes Forecasts for Budget Surplus, Economic Growth   By Madelene Pearson and Gemma Daley         Nov. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Australia&amp;#039;s government slashed its forecast  budget surplus by 75 percent, saying the slowest economic growth in  eight years and fallout from the global financial crisis will erode  tax revenue.      The cash surplus in the year to June 30, 2009, will be A$5.4  billion ($3.8 billion), compared with A$21.7 billion forecast in  May, as revenue falls and the government gives cash handouts to  families, pensioners and homebuyers, Treasurer Wayne Swan said in  Canberra today. The economy will grow 2 percent compared with a May  prediction of 2.75 percent.      The central bank has cut the benchmark interest rate by 2  percentage points since September, the most aggressive round of  reductions since the economy was in recession in 1991. Recent  reports show house prices fell by the most since 1978, building  approvals had the biggest drop in two years, the services industry  shrank for a seventh month and retail sales contracted as  Australia&amp;#039;s 17 years of economic growth comes to an end.      ``The revisions are a little bit conservative given the magnitude  of what we&amp;#039;ve seen happening in the markets,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said David de Garis,  senior markets economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney.  ``It looks to us that when it&amp;#039;s all tallied, the government will be  skating close to a deficit,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; its first since 2002.      Still, unlike in the U.S., Australia does not plan to borrow to  finance a fiscal stimulus package it has introduced to protect the  economy in the face of the global market turmoil. The U.S. had a  record $455 billion budget deficit in the 12 months ended  September.       Cash Handouts       Swan also been forced to slash his budget surplus after an Oct. 14  promise to give pensioners, home buyers and families A$10.4 billion  in handouts to boost the economy. Bank deposits and ``wholesale  term funding&amp;#039;&amp;#039; have also been guaranteed, with the government ready  to do more should the need arise.      The cash handouts came on top of the biggest income-tax cuts in  history, delivered in the May budget, which the government said  will add A$5.1 billion to consumer spending in 2008-09. Household  spending accounts for two-thirds of the A$1 trillion economy.      The global financial crisis is forecast to reduce revenue from  taxes by around A$40 billion over the next four years, Swan said  today.      Australia&amp;#039;s benchmark S&amp;amp;amp;P/ASX 200 Index of stocks has plunged  32 percent this year, and property prices fell in the third quarter  by the most since 1978, reducing government revenue from capital  gains tax.       Company Taxes       Falling company profits will also cut government tax receipts.  Caltex Australia Ltd., the nation&amp;#039;s biggest oil refiner, said this  week foreign-currency losses arising from an ``unprecedented&amp;#039;&amp;#039; drop  in the Australian dollar will reduce its 2008 profit by about A$200  million. The currency has tumbled 30 percent since hitting a  25-year-high 98.49 U.S. cents on July 16.      The unemployment rate, now at 4.3 percent, will rise to 5 percent  by the June quarter of 2009 and 5.75 percent the following year,  taking more out of government revenue, Swan said.      Companies such as Qantas Airways Ltd. and Ford Motor Co. are firing  workers after economic growth slowed in the second quarter to 0.3  percent, its weakest pace in more than three years, as consumers  cut spending and business confidence slumped.      ``Global economic conditions have changed dramatically in recent  months as the global financial crisis has entered a dangerous new  phase,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Swan, 54, told reporters.       China Demand       Demand has slowed for exports from the world&amp;#039;s biggest shipper of  coal and iron ore to China and Japan. Home-building approvals fell  the most in two years in September, the Bureau of Statistics said  in Sydney today.      The International Monetary Fund&amp;#039;s World Economic Outlook in October  forecast global economic growth will slow to 3 percent in 2009, a  world recession under the fund&amp;#039;s informal definition.      ``While Australia is clearly not immune from the effects of the  global financial crisis and the global downturn, we are better  placed than most other countries to withstand the fallout,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Swan  said.      The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its benchmark interest rate by  three quarters of a percentage point yesterday, following a 1  percentage point reduction in October and a quarter-point drop in  September. The U.S., China, India, Japan and South Korea all  lowered borrowing costs in the past week.      The government today forecast a A$3.6 billion surplus in 2009-2010,  with economic growth of 2.25 percent and a A$2.6 billion surplus in  2010-2011.      Inflation will be 3.5 percent this fiscal year, above the central  bank&amp;#039;s annual target of between 2 percent and 3 percent. It will be  3 percent in 2009-2010, Swan said.      The consumer price index in the third quarter jumped 5 percent from  a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2001.      Swan is due to release the national budget for 2009-10 and at 7.30  p.m. on May 12 in Canberra.       http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&amp;amp;amp;sid=agBU9jfON3BE&amp;amp;amp;refer=economy
