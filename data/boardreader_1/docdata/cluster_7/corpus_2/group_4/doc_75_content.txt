By Wayne Cole    SYDNEY, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Australia&amp;#039;s conflicted consumers turned a little less gloomy in November, a survey showed on Wednesday, as sharp falls in interest rates and petrol prices helped lighten a pervasive pessimism about the economy.    The tentative improvement came as Australia&amp;#039;s top Treasury official said he was confident the economy could dodge the recessions gripping other developed countries, in part because of aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus already underway.    &amp;#039;Of course it is possible that Australia will avoid a negative quarter of growth. We&amp;#039;re trying our hardest to make sure that happens,&amp;#039; said Ken Henry, Treasury&amp;#039;s top civil servant.    &amp;#039;We can talk ourselves into worse outcomes. But we don&amp;#039;t have to.&amp;#039;    Australia has not suffered a quarter of economic contraction since 2000, and that was a one-off caused by the introduction of a sales tax. The last recession was in the early 1990s, but some fear it could be on the cusp of another given the strains in global markets and weakness in consumer spending at home.    The Labor government has aimed to bolster consumers with a A$10.4 billion ($6.8 billion) package of cash handouts and family benefits, most of which will hit wallets in time for Christmas. Henry was optimistic that much of this would be spent straight away, supporting growth this quarter.    He also left open the option of more fiscal largesse, saying further action could be taken domestically if needed, and noted markets were pricing in yet deeper cuts in interest rates.    The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week slashed its key cash rate by 75 basis points to 5.25 percent, bringing the easing since September to 2 full percentage points. That was the most aggressive move since the recession of 1990/91 and worth more than A$400 a month to a household with an average mortgage.    HARD WORK    All this stimulus seemed to be having some effect.    The closely watched Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment bounced by 4.3 percent in November amid an improvement in the longer-term outlook for the economy.    &amp;#039;This is a welcome result,&amp;#039; said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans, noting respondents felt more confident about buying a major household item in a boost for hard-pressed retailers.    Yet, Evans also noted that November&amp;#039;s bounce only recouped part of October&amp;#039;s steep 11 percent dive and left the index down 22.6 percent on last year. Pessimists still outnumbered optimists, and had done for the longest period since the recession of 1990/91.    Consumers also remained worried about their personal finances, likely reflecting the painful blow to household wealth from this year&amp;#039;s dive in share prices.    &amp;#039;Today&amp;#039;s data shows how just how hard policy is having to work to support a still-fragile consumer in the face of a very negative news flow of global financial market problems and job security,&amp;#039; said Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS.    That was one reason he expected the RBA to slash rates to just 4.0 percent over coming months, which would be the lowest in at least two decades.    Adding to the case for cuts were figures showing a clear moderation in wages growth, added Haslem.    The government&amp;#039;s main measure of wages rose 0.9 percent in the third quarter, below forecasts of a 1.0 percent increase and down from 1.1 percent the previous quarter.    The annual pace of growth held at 4.1 percent, still well short of the 4.5 percent pace that economists consider a potential threat to inflation.    The RBA had long been concerned that a very tight labour market would eventually stoke wage costs, though annual growth remained around 4 percent even as unemployment hit 30-year lows of 3.9 percent earlier this year.    Since then, the jobless rate has edged up to 4.3 percent and, with the economy clearly slowing, analysts expect a further steady climb toward 6 percent by the end of 2009.
