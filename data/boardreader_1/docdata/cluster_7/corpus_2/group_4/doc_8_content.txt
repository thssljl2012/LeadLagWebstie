  Can anyone explain this situation though   &amp;amp;quot;Barclays Bank Base Rate follows the Bank of England Base Rate, which can go up or down and is announced by the Bank of England&amp;#039;s Monetary Policy Committee every month&amp;amp;quot;   Where does it say ... unless teh rate drops in which case we are not obliged to follow BoE
