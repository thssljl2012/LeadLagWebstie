  I have got a lifetime tracker repayment mortgage (been with them for two years) and just wondered if they have annouced if they are going to pass on the cut in interest rates?     I received a yearly statement dated 7.10.08 but it only passed on .25% decrease (38 a month decrease) I wondered if i would be better off setting up a mortgage with a different bank at a lower rate or should i just hold on for another month or so.     Any advice would be geat
