By Wayne Cole    SYDNEY, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Australia&amp;#039;s conflicted consumers turned a little less gloomy in November, a survey showed on Wednesday, as sharp falls in interest rates and petrol prices helped lighten a pervasive pessimism about the economy.    There also looked to be scope for yet more rate cuts as figures showed wages grew by less than expected last quarter, likely reinforcing the Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s (RBA) belief that inflation had peaked.    &amp;#039;This should give the RBA confidence that the risk of a wages break-out is all but passed and inflation will moderate,&amp;#039; said Brian Redican, a senior economist at Macquarie. &amp;#039;That means they can keep cutting aggressively.&amp;#039;    He, like many investors, expects another cut of 75 basis points in December which would take the cash rate to a six-year low of 4.5 percent.    &amp;#039;And it&amp;#039;s just as well, given how negative sentiment has become on the global outlook,&amp;#039; added Redican. &amp;#039;Consumers need all the help they can get.&amp;#039;    The central bank last week slashed its key cash rate by 75 basis points to 5.25 percent, bringing the easing since September to 2 full percentage points. That was the most aggressive move since the recession of 1990/91 and worth more than A$400 a month to a household with an average mortgage. At the same time, petrol prices had fallen steadily and the government launched a A$10.4 billion ($6.8 billion) stimulus package, most of which would hit wallets in time for Christmas.    All of which was enough to nudge up the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment by 4.3 percent to 85.5 in November.    &amp;#039;This is a welcome result,&amp;#039; said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans, noting respondents felt more confident about buying a major household item in a boost for hard-pressed retailers.    BAD NEWS    Yet, Evans also noted that November&amp;#039;s bounce only recouped part of October&amp;#039;s steep 11 percent dive and left the index down 22.6 percent on last year. Pessimists still outnumbered optimists, and had done for the longest period since the recession of 1990/91.    Consumers also remained worried about their personal finances, likely reflecting the painful blow to household wealth from this year&amp;#039;s dive in share prices.    &amp;#039;Today&amp;#039;s data shows how just how hard policy is having work to support a still-fragile consumer in the face of very negative news flow of global financial market problems and job security,&amp;#039; said Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS.    That was one reason he expected the RBA to slash rates to just 4.0 percent over coming months, which would be the lowest in at least two decades.    Adding to the case for cuts was the clear moderation in wages growth, added Haslem.    The government&amp;#039;s main measure of wages rose 0.9 percent in the third quarter, below forecasts of a 1.0 percent increase and down from 1.1 percent the previous quarter.    The annual pace of growth held at 4.1 percent, still well short of the 4.5 percent pace that economists consider a potential threat to inflation.    The RBA had long been concerned that a very tight labour market would eventually stoke wage costs, though annual growth remained around 4 percent even as unemployment hit 30-year lows of 3.9 percent earlier this year.    Since then, the jobless rate has edged up to 4.3 percent and, with the economy clearly slowing, analysts expect a further steady climb toward 6 percent by the end of 2009.
