 NAB to raise $2b in new shares    http://business.smh.com.au/business/...1110-5l1h.html      November 10, 2008 - 8:55AM   National Australia Bank is raising $2 billion in a share placement to strengthen its balance sheet  and &amp;#039;&amp;#039;take advantage of organic growth opportunities&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, the bank said.    The nation&amp;#039;s biggest lender cited more favourable market conditions for its move, which it said would be equivalent to expected shortfalls in its dividend reinvestment plan.     The share proceeds would take its tier-one capital adequacy ratio to about 8.0% , NAB added.    Australian banks have so far largely weathered the subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent global credit squeeze without too many major problems, unlike their peers in the US and Europe.    But with growing signs of a global recession, even Australian banks will be forced to restructure their businesses and raise more capital, according to analysts.     A number of recent failures among Australian companies has also added to fund raising pressures at major banks .     Last month  NAB reported a quadrupling in bad debt charges  and a 28% drop in second-half cash profit .    [...]  The plan would allow ordinary shareholders to subscribe for up to $10,000 worth of NAB ordinary shares, the bank said, adding it would reserve the right to scale back applications if total demand exceeded $250 million.
