Michael West  &amp;amp;lt;!--@AssetInListHeadline:                         Asset-287512-List-55847 --&amp;amp;gt; CBA&amp;#039;s indecent                         exposure                            40% of next year funds has been met.Good news!!                                                     Whether it&amp;#039;s Allco, ABC Learning, Centro, Commander - name your                         &amp;quot;Bad Boy&amp;#039;&amp;#039; - Commonwealth Bank is there, merrily lending hundreds                         of millions.                           It has the biggest exposure to corporate collapses in the                         hemisphere although, until now, its sheer size and the perceived                         lower exposure to derivatives have priced the bank at a premium to                         its peers on the stock market.                           That premium is now being wiped out.                           On Goldman Sachs&amp;#039; forecast earnings numbers for 2009, CBA trades                         at a 38% premium to National Australia Bank.                           Among key points from this morning&amp;#039;s first-quarter trading                         update, bad debt charges will be up next year but no estimate has                         been given yet - which is a bad look. There&amp;#039;s a briefing this                         afternoon that may shed some light.                                                     ...
