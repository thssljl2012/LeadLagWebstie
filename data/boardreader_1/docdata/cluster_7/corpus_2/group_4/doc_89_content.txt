                                         Quote:                          Originally Posted by  dlcx                         Another newbie here.. so in a case like this, where the SP of NAB has fallen around 8%, is there potential here to buy some for short term gain?   Is there much chance of NAB going up again (eg by 5% in coming weeks)      Or in such a situation, would it contiune to slide?                                             What is the chance of it raining on Saturday? This is essentially what you are asking. What do we know about the current environment? There is great volatility at the moment, moves of 5% a day in either direction are possible, so no doubt there will be rallies that you can trade.        Other things to consider for longer term holders. The current capital raising dilutes existing shareholders by about 9%. Next years eps forecast for NAB was  -1%  (according to comsec). Given the capital raising, the current news on exposure to insolvent firms, NAB&amp;#039;s exposure to CDO&amp;#039;s and CLO&amp;#039;s, and as we enter the really nasty end of the credit cycle, do you think NAB is more likely to be receiving earnings upgrades or downgrades in the next 6 -12 months?   Then, even if you do believe earnings downgrades are forthcoming is it already reflected in the stock price at current levels?
