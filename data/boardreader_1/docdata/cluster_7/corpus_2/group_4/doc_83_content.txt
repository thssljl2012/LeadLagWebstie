Looking at the price of CNP and CER, any hope for them seems to be fading fast.        If Centro fails it will be Australia&amp;#039;s largest corporate collapse. The expiry of the funding deadline is December 15th, which is looming ever closer.       Under that scenario, a target of $15 probably couldn&amp;#039;t be ruled out at all.                                             Keep an eye out for what discount to book value Centro are accepting for asset sales in CAWF/CSIF etc. CBA &amp;amp;amp; Co controls this process now. If it starts heading to the &amp;#039;firesale&amp;#039; territory (say 15% plus), then you know that CBA and co are &amp;#039;losing faith&amp;#039; in trying to trade out of the mess Centro are in.
