 MLPs Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 11              UBS on what I call the &amp;#039;new reality&amp;#039; of MLP-world   First - my thanks to Gary [passandshoot] for posting the UBS report to the Yahoo MLP group.      From that report of 10-31-08:      &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The MLP bull market in recent years had been predicated on inexpensive capital funding accretive acquisitions and growth projects which, in turn, drove distribution growth.  However, if debt and equity become more expensive, this whole strategy comes into question, which has been the key concern lately. Indeed, credit has become more expensive and, arguably, less accessible as banks tighten credit through charging higher rates and fees for larger or new credit facilities. MLP debt issuance, which started the year at a faster pace than last year, has not been transacted since July; and equity issuance has become prohibitively expensive for most MLPs in the current market as the median pipeline yield has increased to ~10%.       &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; During the first half of 2008, around $14.6 billion of debt and equity were issued. The pace slowed to only ~$1.9 billion in 3Q08 and there has not been any issuance thus far in 4Q08.  The capital markets were more receptive to deals done by larger and more established MLPs. Partnerships with an enterprise value of greater than $4 billion account for almost 50% of non-IPO equity issuance so far and MLPs possessing an investment grade rating have accounted for ~75% of debt issuance this year.  This scenario raises the question as to whether the newer, smaller MLPs without strategic and committed sponsors can still access the capital markets on terms that allow capital spending to be accretive.      &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Additionally, we believe the prolonged weakness in the MLP space might cause a certain degree of investor fatigue and therefore reduce investor appetite for MLP equity. As such, this new higher cost of capital will eat into the economics and potential returns of growth projects for some MLPs. In turn, we believe that certain MLPs will not sustain the current levels of distribution growth, either because they cannot afford to or choose not to if the market does not reward the growth (i.e., management might believe its yield is too high and decide to retain incremental cash instead of distribute it).  Whereas the search for growth has dominated the MLP space over the past several years, we believe the search for quality MLPs with stronger funding positions is the key differentiator in these turbulent times.  [ I think I wrote something like that on 10-25 ]         My Summation   : [ 1] Cheap capital [low priced debt &amp;amp;amp; equity with low yields] led to [2] accretive cap ex projects which led to [3] high distribution growth which led to [4] Cheap capital. That chain has been broken . Until that cycle is reinstated - the G&amp;amp;amp;Ps [which tend to be the smaller MLPs] are in trouble. Add to that the fact that the G&amp;amp;amp;Ps are more commodity sensitive. On the one hand, the G&amp;amp;amp;Ps are hedged. On the other hand, as G&amp;amp;amp;Ps replace their old hedges, the prices on the new hedges are falling. The G&amp;amp;amp;Ps can report great Q3-08 numbers - and the market will be thinking &amp;#039;just wait till next quarter or next year - those DCFs will be falling&amp;quot;. Until commodity prices rise again - the G&amp;amp;amp;Ps are in trouble. the market will - and the market has been - selling first and looking for answers later.      Note on terminology to newbies:   G&amp;amp;amp;Ps = gathering and processing MLPs [examples of those being (source: Barclays)   APL, HLND, XTEX, DPM, EROC, MWE, NGLS, OKS, CPNO, RGNC, and WPZ  ]      GPs = General Partners [examples of those being AHD, AHGP, BGH, EPE, ETE, HPGP, MGG, NRGP, NSH, XTXI
