 ECB May Have Embarked on Fastest-Ever Round of Rate  Reductions       By Gabi Thesing      Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank has embarked on  the fastest round of interest-rate cuts in its history as the  financial crisis threatens to cripple the economy, a survey of  economists shows.      The Frankfurt-based ECB will slash its benchmark rate to 2.5  percent by April, according to the median of 28 forecasts in the  Bloomberg News survey. That would see the rate drop 1.75 percentage  points from its 4.25 percent peak in six months, outpacing the  ECB&amp;#039;s last easing cycle between May 2001 and June 2003. The bank  has already lowered the rate by half a point 3.75 percent as part  of a globally coordinated move on Oct. 8.      ``Desperate times call for desperate measures,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Julian  Callow, chief European Economist at Barclays Capital in London.  ``The economy is fast sinking into recession and as a number of  Governing Council members were directly involved in bank rescues it  has really brought the crisis home for them.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Central banks around the world are cutting borrowing costs  aggressively as the financial crisis that started with the U.S.  housing slump threatens to tip the global economy into recession.  The economy of the 15 nations sharing the euro shrank in the second  quarter and executive and consumer confidence in the outlook fell  the most on record this month to a 15-year low.      ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said this week a rate reduction  at the Nov. 6 policy meeting is likely as inflation pressures ease.  The ECB will cut its key rate by another half- point to 3.25  percent next week, a survey of economists shows. Quarter-point cuts  will follow in December, February and April, according to the  survey.      `Down Rapidly&amp;#039;      Deutsche Bank economists predict the ECB will cut the rate to a  record low of 1.5 percent by the middle of next year.      ``If the economy cools, then rates have to come down rapidly so one  doesn&amp;#039;t risk falling behind the curve,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; ECB council member Axel  Weber said last night. Fellow council member Nout Wellink told the  Dutch parliament yesterday that economic growth in Europe ``is more  likely to be closer to 0 percent than 1 percent next year.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Inflation is slowing as the economy stumbles and oil prices slump.  The euro-area inflation rate dropped to 3.2 percent in October from  3.6 percent in September, the European Union statistics office in  Luxembourg said today. ECB policy makers including France&amp;#039;s  Christian Noyer expect the rate to fall below the bank&amp;#039;s 2 percent  limit by the middle of next year.      ``Inflation is easing and we are acting in a progressive way,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; ECB  Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi told Italian broadcaster  RAI. Still, he also said in Rome today that central banks must not  repeat mistakes of the past by cutting rates too much.      ``The present crisis is partially due to interest rates that  remained at low levels for too long,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Bini Smaghi said. ``At that  time, rates were lowered too much in order to stimulate growth. We  need to avoid repeating the same mistakes.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      The U.S. Federal Reserve this week reduced its rate to 1 percent  from 1.5 percent and the Bank of Japan also lowered borrowing  costs. The Bank of England is poised to cut its benchmark rate by  half a point to 4 percent on Nov. 6, another survey shows.
