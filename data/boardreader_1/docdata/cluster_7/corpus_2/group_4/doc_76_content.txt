As a St. George customer I am not happy   with their tardiness in passing on interest rate cuts lately.      Last month they were the last to drop their rates by nearly a whole month and this time they are yet to even make an announcement....       How much money are they making out of all this.....        They now have the highest standard interest rate of the 5 major banks, so on this performance only I would not recommend them to anyone....      They used to be the best bank and market themselves as such. Not anymore.      Are you listening St. George ?         NOT HAPPY        http://www.news.com.au/business/mone...016199,00.html       .
