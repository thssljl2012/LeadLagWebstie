                                         Quote:                          Originally Posted by  agro                         do you think CBA and other banks will maintain their dividends for next year?                                             So far SUN seems to be the only bank that has admitted dividends will be cut. ANZ and WBC have specifically insisted that dividends will be maintained, just like the government and RBA saying we will not have a recession.      Realistically, it&amp;#039;s such a no brainer that dividends will have to be cut.
