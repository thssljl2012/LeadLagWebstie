Any price effect is just a reflection of the current state of the general market.                                             Agreed, this wont be good news for short term investors. However in the long run I think it will help strengthen the company. Does anyone out there think this might be NAB preparing to buy some of suncorp? I have no reason to think this besides the fact it is a very large amount raised.
