Our UK friends sure are having trouble lowering the rates to the borrowers.  http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/mon...cle5076547.ece       US Banks aren&amp;#039;t passing on the rate drops to the customer. ..       So what happens here? I&amp;#039;m thinking 7% fixed may be it, variable may float down a little under 7% for a while, but that will only be so long as the economy is seen as &amp;amp;quot;distressed&amp;amp;quot;.       As a potential borrower, while 5-6% real mortgage rates would be nice, reckon there is snowball chance of it happening.                                             After this latest cut, the ACTUAL rate I&amp;#039;m paying (permanent variable rate, not fixed or honeymoon etc) will be just about 7% flat already, maybe even under that (watch this space), assuming all banks drop by about .6% as the CBA has just announced. The highest rate I paid was 8.87% earlier this year. We will see 6.x% by later this year easy I reckon, and lower again by next year.      Cheers,      Beej
