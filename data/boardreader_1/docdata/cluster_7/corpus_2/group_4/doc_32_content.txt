 Wow thanks Nick, that is some very in depth analsis. I will be watching CBA very closely for the rest of the week, especially after the 6.29% fall ($2.39) today. I think if CBA hits $30 i will be buying, the only worry is their $600+ million exposure to ABC and $200million exposure to Allco.      Guess we&amp;#039;ll have to wait and see.      Thanks again Nick
