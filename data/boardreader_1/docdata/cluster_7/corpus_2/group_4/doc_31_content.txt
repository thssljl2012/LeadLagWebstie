SYDNEY, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Australia&amp;#039;s economy could be in for a hard landing, a private index suggested on Wednesday, as sliding share prices bludgeoned household wealth and consumption.    The annualised growth rate of the Westpac Institutional Bank-Melbourne Institute leading index of economic activity sank to 1.1 percent in September, from 3.5 percent in August, the largest fall since the mid-1980&amp;#039;s and worse even than the recession of 1990/91.    &amp;#039;This is a very disturbing fall in the growth rate of the Leading Index,&amp;#039; said Westpac&amp;#039;s chief economist, Bill Evans.    &amp;#039;It is consistent with Westpac&amp;#039;s view that growth in the first half of 2009 will be barely positive, with a decent risk that the first two quarters of growth in 2009 could be negative,&amp;#039; he warned.    Two consecutive quarters of contraction is the technical definition of a recession.    Falling share prices took 0.5 percentage points from the leading index in September, while a steep drop in U.S. industrial production took a hefty 1.1 points. With equity markets dropping sharply in October and November, further falls in the growth rate of the Index were highly likely, Evans said.    The weak result reinforced Westpac&amp;#039;s expectation that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would cut interest rates by 75 basis points to 4.5 percent in December, the third straight month of aggressive easing.    The level of the leading index fell 2.5 points in September to 258.4. The coincident index, which measures current growth, edged up 0.1 point to 236.0, though its annualised growth rate slowed further to 1.6 percent from 1.8 percent in August.
