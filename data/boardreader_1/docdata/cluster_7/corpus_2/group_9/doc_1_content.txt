   German Investor Sentiment Increases to Two-Year High         By Gabi Thesing        April 21 (Bloomberg) --  German investor confidence  rose to the highest level in almost two years in April after  stock markets rallied  on government and central bank efforts to revive economic growth.  The  ZEW  Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim said its index of investor and analyst expectations rose to 13 from minus 3.5 in March. Thats the highest since June 2007 and the first positive reading since July 2007. Economists expected a gain to 2, according to the median of 35 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.       European stocks  last week posted their sixth consecutive weekly advance as speculation grew that the worst of the financial crisis has passed.  German Chancellor Angela Merkels coalition  will spend about 80 billion euros ($104 billion) to stem the countrys worst recession in over six decades and the  European Central Bank  has signaled it will cut interest rates again to a new record low.      Todays message is that the recession will be over by autumn at the latest, said Andreas Rees, chief Germany economist at UniCredit Group in Munich. At the same time, the level is a bit ambitious and investors may have priced in a tad too much optimism.      European bonds pared gains after the report and the   euro   rose almost half a cent to $1.2990.        Deep Recession        Still,  ZEWs gauge of current conditions  fell to minus 91.6, the lowest since September 2003, from minus 89.4 in March.      Nobody knows what the economic recovery will look like, said Frank Appel, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Post AG, Europes biggest mail carrier. We need to prepare for a long recession, even if we hope for a quick recovery.      The  German economy , Europes largest, will shrink 5.3 percent this year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Business confidence  fell to the lowest level in more than 26 years in March and  industrial production  dropped for a sixth month in February.  Adding to signs of a deepening economic slump,  German producer prices  declined 0.5 percent from a year earlier in March, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Thats the biggest drop since September 2002.      The  International Monetary Fund  has tried to temper optimism about the outlook, saying on April 16 that the global economy is in the grip of a severe recession and a recovery will probably be weak. The IMF publishes revised forecasts tomorrow.        Stocks Rally        Germanys benchmark  DAX index  has nevertheless gained 8.5 percent in the past month amid optimism that some $5 trillion added to the world economy by governments will ensure that the worst of the recession is confined to 2009. The  DAX  extended gains after the ZEW report today.       U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke  said April 14 that the sharp decline is slowing and President Barack Obama, while warning of pitfalls ahead, said government action is starting to generate signs of economic progress.       Bank of America Corp.  yesterday reported first-quarter profit that beat the most optimistic analysts estimates. The largest U.S. bank by assets follows JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. in posting first- quarter earnings that topped analyst forecasts.  Hannover Re, Germanys second-biggest reinsurer, said April 17 it had a good start to the year.        Slow Improvements        We are seeing very slow improvements, said Aline Schuiling, an economist at Fortis Bank in Amsterdam. If anything, its the end of the freefall for the German economy.      A 67 percent decline in the price of  crude oil  since July pushed  German inflation  to the lowest level in almost 10 years in March, with prices rising just 0.4 percent from a year earlier.      Waning inflation pressures across the 16-nation euro region have prompted the  ECB  to cut 3 percentage points off its key rate since early October, bringing the benchmark to a record low of 1.25 percent.   ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet  has indicated the central bank will lower the rate further next month and announce additional non-standard measures to counter the economic slump. Council member Christian Noyer told RTL radio today that the bank has room for a reduction in borrowing costs, though its not very large.      Last Updated: April 21, 2009 06:14 EDT
