  Australia's central bank hikes cash target rate 25 basis points to 7.00 percent        SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) -  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)  said Tuesday it has increased its  cash target rate  25 basis points to 7.00 percent in a move to combat building inflationary pressures in the economy. The RBA decided to lift the target rate at today's meeting of the central bank's board, the first policy meeting for 2008. It followed data showing that  Australia's inflationary rate  has moved beyond the 2-3 percent range the central bank aims to keep inflation within.      The rate hike comes as major central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, are moving to ease monetary policy because of concerns about economic growth.      In Australia, inflation data together with other data continues to point to an economy running at  close to full capacity , driven by a booming resources sector due to strong demand for commodities from emerging Asian economies including China. RBA governor Glenn Stevens said in the short-term  inflation  is likely to remain relatively high and will probably rise further in year-ended terms, though the bank expects it to moderate somewhat next year. 'But given the extent of pressure on capacity and the build up in inflation, a significant slowing in demand from its recent pace is likely to be necessary to reduce inflation over time,' Stevens said in a statement.      Today's increase was widely anticipated by economists, who said the only thing standing in the way of higher interest rates would have been the global credit crunch worsening. It takes the RBA's cash target rate to the highest level in 12 years and continues a tightening phase which began in May 2002 when the rate was hiked 25 basis points to 4.50 percent. Stevens said pressures in short-term money markets seen late last year have eased in recent weeks, but sentiment in international capital and equity markets remains fragile. 'In Australia, financial intermediaries have passed on higher costs to their customers over the past couple of months. There has also been some tightening of lending standards to risky borrowers, a process which may yet have further to go,' he said.       Last year  the central bank lifted the cash target rate in August by 25 basis points to 6.50 percent and again in November by the same amount to 6.75 percent, as inflationary indicators showed annual consumer price inflation data moving to the top end of the RBA's target range.      Data released last month showed the central bank's core measure of inflation, the trimmed mean consumer price index (CPI), was up 3.4 percent year-on-year in the final quarter of 2007, leading to expectations of a February rate hike. On Monday, TD Securities' monthly inflation gauge showed the underlying annual rate of inflation accelerated to a record 4.0 percent in January.      Economists said the latest hike might prove to be the only one this year as Australia should feel the impact of slowing global economic growth as the US economy struggles to avoid falling into recession, while the RBA's tightening moves should result in cooling domestic demand.      HSBC Australia chief economist John Edwards said  December building approvals  data released today, showing a sharp 11.6 percent drop in approvals to build private homes from November, suggests last year's rate hikes were having some impact. 'It is one of the very few signals in recent data that the two tightenings in the second half of last year may be having some impact,' Edwards said. He said though Stevens does not expect the annual inflation numbers to begin to fall until next year, he was otherwise uncommitted on the next move. 'As he mentions, global growth is slowing, market interest rates have already increased, and tightening of credit standards will continue. All those factors would suggest a 7.0 percent cash rate is the peak,' Edwards said.       December retail data , also released today, showed weaker than expected sales. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent from November, below a consensus forecast for a 0.6 percent rise. 'Although the result was slightly below expectations, the data continues to suggest relatively little impact on spending from the two 25 basis points rate hikes in August and November 2007 and the added impact of financial turmoil and higher fuel prices in late 2007,' said Westpac Banking Corp economists in a market note.      The RBA said its board took careful note of recent events abroad and developments in financial markets. 'The world economy is slowing and it now appears likely that global growth will be below trend in 2008,' Stevens said. But, he said, recent trends in world commodity markets suggest that  Australia's terms of trade  are likely to rise further. 'Having weighed both the international and domestic information available, the board concluded that a tighter monetary policy setting was needed now,' Stevens said. 'In future meetings, the board will continue to evaluate whether the stance of policy will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the 2-3 percent target.'
