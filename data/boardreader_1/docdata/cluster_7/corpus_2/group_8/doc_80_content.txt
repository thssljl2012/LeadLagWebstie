I don't recall seeing such bad numbers before:           Quote:                         THE world economy has taken a sharp turn for the worse, with early estimates showing global output fell more than 4 per cent in the last three months of last year, with further decline expected over the next six months.      The OECD warned yesterday of a "deep slowdown" in all major industrial economies and most of the emerging economies, including China.      The last official forecasts from the International Monetary Fund had predicted China would continue to record strong growth, while the world economy was tipped to grow 2.2 per cent this year. However, estimates are being revised sharply lower in the wake of huge falls in industrial production in all major world economies....      The US bank JPMorgan estimates that economic growth in the industrialised world fell at anannual rate of 5.2 per cent in the December quarter while emerging countries contracted by 2.3 per cent.      Official figures will be released over the next six weeks, but JPMorgan estimates the global downturn at 4.6 per cent.      JPMorgan economist Helen Kevans said the bank had been expecting that Australia would enjoy a lift in its exports next year, but had downgraded its forecast and expected Australia to suffer a recession with negative growth in both the December and March quarters.      Monthly surveys of manufacturing production conducted in all major economies indicate that world industrial production slumped 19 per cent in the December quarter.      World steel output tumbled 17per cent between September and November.      "Chinese production was falling sharply, and although it stabilised a bit in November, there were massive falls in the United States and in other steel-producing countries," ABN-Amro chief economist Kieran Davies said.      He noted that Japan's industrial production fell by 8 per cent in November, its biggest fall in 55 years. There were smaller falls in industrial production in Germany, France, Britain and Spain....      ANZ international economist Amy Auster said the figures on world manufacturing output were much worse than for service industries. She said it was possible that manufacturing was being damaged by the reduced availability of trade finance, which was choked by the global banking crisis in October and November.      This had contributed to some huge falls in trade. Taiwan, for example, reported a 42 per cent slump in its exports in November. Korea's export shipments have also been hit, falling 17 per cent last month, with forecasts of a 30per cent fall this month.                      http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au...73-601,00.html
