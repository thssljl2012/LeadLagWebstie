  USD Hits Fresh Record Lows    by Korman Tam  10/18/2007 3:35:00 PM    The dollar stumbled to new all-time lows against the  euro  beneath the 1.43-level and crossed the 2.05-threshold versus the  sterling  for the first time since late July. The renewed weakness in the greenback comes amid heightened expectations that the  FOMC  will move again at the end of this month  to lower its benchmark lending rate . Fed Funds futures reflected a 70% probability of a rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting on Oct 30-31.  The trade-weighted dollar index  dropped to a new low at 77.48 with few signs to suggest an imminent recovery. Further dragging sentiment for the dollar were lingering  concerns of credit conditions  with Bank of America reporting dismal Q3 profit, which plunged 32% from a year earlier.    Economic data from the US continued to reinforce deteriorating fundamentals. The reports included  weekly jobless claims ,  September leading economic indicators  and the  October Philadelphia Fed survey . Weekly jobless claims edged up higher to 316.5k versus 310.25 a week prior. The leading economic indicators for September reversed the 0.6% decline from August, improving to 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed survey slipped by more than anticipated to 6.8, versus estimates for a smaller decline to 7.3 from 10.0 in September. The  new orders component  tumbled to 2.7 from 15.1, while the prices paid index almost doubled to 40.3 versus 23.1.  __________________________________________________  _____    US dollar weaker against major currencies on weak data and Q3 earnings      SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) - The US dollar extended losses against major currencies in midmorning trade Friday after  significantly higher than expected weekly jobless claims  and  disappointing corporate earnings  overnight triggered heavy selling in the greenback as investors switched to safer assets.    The dollar fell to an all-time low against the euro and a 2-week low against the yen in New York trade after  weekly jobless claims  rose 28,000 to 337,000 - 21,000 more than expected and the highest number in 7 weeks.    Meanwhile, the  Bank of America , the largest deposit bank in the US, reported a 32 percent fall in third-quarter earnings due to credit market write-downs and loan losses.    The bad news fuelled concerns over the  health of the US economy  and the  sub-prime mortgage crisis , and boosted the chances of the  Federal Reserve easing interest rates  again at its meeting on October 31.    'Unlike earlier this week when market losses from Citigroup earnings boosted the US dollar against most currencies on flight to quality, the current market declines are triggering broad dollar losses as the latest news are not only US-specific, but also due to  Wednesday's ominously weak US figures on building permits and housing starts ,' said Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign exchange analyst at CMC Markets in the US.    At 9.50 am (2350 GMT), the US dollar was buying 115.57   yen   compared with 115.60 yen in late New York trade. It fell as low as 115.28 yen after the Bank of America released its third-quarter results.    The   euro   was up at 1.4293 US dollars after soaring to a record high of  1.4311  US dollars overnight. It closed around 1.4290 US dollars.    The dollar is expected to surrender more ground after finance ministers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and the US conclude their  meeting in Washington on Friday .    The  G7 finance ministers  are expected to focus on the Chinese yuan, which they believe is undervalued, rather than take steps to reverse the dollar's sustained weakness.    'There might be some hesitation about getting too aggressive, pushing the euro/dollar too high ahead of the G7, but if the G7 doesn't surprise and sticks to the same rhetoric, the dollar should swoon again on Monday morning as sentiment is very bearish,' said John Noonan, an analyst at Thomson IFR.    As investors lose their appetite for risk they are  turning to low-yielding currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc, which are seen as safer investments.     'Since Monday, the   yen   is up 1.6 percent versus the dollar and the   Swiss franc   is 1 percent higher, followed by the euro (up 0.65 percent) as the next best performer among G10 currencies,' said John Kyriakopoulos, head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank.    The higher-yielding   sterling  ,   Australian dollar   and   New Zealand dollar   are at the bottom of the table, Kyriakopoulos said.    Meanwhile, lower risk appetite is stopping the   Australian dollar   benefiting from weakness in the greenback. The   Aussie   was buying  89.55  US cents compared with an overnight close of  89.74  US cents.  __________________________________________________      BONDS  : Treasury prices rose again after rallying sharply Wednesday amid growing signs of trouble in the housing sector.
