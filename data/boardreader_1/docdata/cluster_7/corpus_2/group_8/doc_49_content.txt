The Australian dollar has opened lower but was trading in a tight range ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) March board meeting and interest rate decision.     At 0700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6308/11, down from Monday's close of $US0.6335/38.     During offshore trading, the unit moved between a low of $US0.6291 and a high of $US0.6386.     The US dollar was strongly supported during the overnight session, as weak global equity markets prompted safe-haven buying.     The major indices on Wall Street were down more than three per cent heading into the last hour of trade in New York after troubled global insurer AIG reported a massive $US61.7 billion ($A96.94 billion) fourth quarter loss.     Separately, the US government announced it was injecting an additional $US30 billion ($A47.13 billion) into the company.     The Dollar Index, which measures the US dollar against a basket of six currencies, touched a three-year high during the overnight session.
