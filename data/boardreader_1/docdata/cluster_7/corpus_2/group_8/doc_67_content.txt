Slower growth to halt interest rate rises   March 19, 2008 10:59am   Article from: AAPFont size: + -   Send this article: Print Email    GROWTH in Australia will slow in the months ahead given a rise in borrowing costs and credit market woes, which will stop the central bank from raising rates again, according to a leading forecaster.      The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Index of Economic Activity, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity three to nine months in the future, was 4.1 per cent in January, just below its long-term trend of 4.2 per cent.      It is the first time the index has slipped below the long-term trend since November 2005.      The index has also fallen significantly since November last year, when the annualised growth rate was 6.3 per cent.      Westpac chief economist Bill Evans expected growth to slow through 2008 and 2009. "We expect domestic demand growth to slow from the strong 5.7 per cent in 2007 to 3.8 per cent in 2008 and 1.9 per cent in 2009," he said.      "This slowdown will be driven by the Reserve Bank's clear commitment to rein in inflationary pressures and the impact on the economy of the dislocation in credit markets."      Around the world, the index said outlook for growth in the major developed economies "continues to worsen".      Rate rises ended      Mr Evans said today's result implies the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is now at the end of its current tightening cycle.      "Westpac now expects that the RBA cash rate has peaked," Mr Evans said in a statement today.      "We do not expect that the RBA will see the need to raise rates again in this long tightening cycle, which began in May 2002."      But Mr Evans said interest rates would remain at these levels "for at least the remainder of the year".      Three of the four monthly components of the leading index increased in January, with dwelling approvals, real money supply and US industrial production (0.1 per cent) all higher.      But their gains were wiped out by a 10.9 per cent drop in the stock market index, the biggest monthly fall since October 1987.          Does this gives us an indication that we'll see interest rates drop next year ????
