   Australia's central bank head sees inflation rising to 4 percent, above target         SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) -  Australia's central bank governor  has predicted  inflation  is poised to rise to 4 percent, fuelling expectations interest rates will be hiked again. Reserve Bank of Australia  governor Glenn Stevens, who has lifted rates twice this year in a bid to curb prices, said the latest inflation figures due next month were unlikely to fall within the bank's official target of 2-3 percent.'When we get the March 2008 figures towards the end of April, we will most likely find that the rise over the four quarters is more like 4 percent,' Stevens said in an address to a Treasury seminar Tuesday, the text of which was released Friday.      The RBA this month lifted its cash rate to a 12-year high of 7.25 percent and economists said Stevens' comments showed it remained hawkish.With the headline inflation rate running at 3.4 percent for calendar 2007, Stevens said reaching the 2-3 percent goal was realistic and rejected calls for the bank to lift its target.'I do not think that the 2-3 percent average inflation target is too ambitious,' he said.  'We have achieved it for the past 15 years and we achieved average outcomes of that order for long periods in the 20th century.  'If we accept that the target could slide up to 3-4 percent, to match actual inflation, how long would it be before we were debating 4-5 percent as a goal?'      Interest rates are generally seen as remaining steady in April, while the RBA assesses the impact of its most recent hikes, with movement regarded as most likely in May.  JPMorgan chief economist Stephen Walters said Stevens indicated the RBA was likely to raise rates in May, regardless of what the major banks did to cope with a global credit crunch.  'With this in mind, we continue to look for another 25 basis point rate hike in early May, even though the Aussie commercial banks are doing some of hard yards for the RBA by raising market interest rates by more than the rises in the official cash rate,' he said.      RBC Capital Markets senior economist Su-Lin Ong said only data showing a major slowdown in the economy was likely to prevent a rate rise in May, given the central bank's tightening bias.  'Whether that bias is exercised or not depends heavily on whether key domestic activity data -- credit growth, consumption, housing -- start to show signs of moderation in the coming months,' she said.  'The onus remains on the data to stop the RBA from lifting rates.'
