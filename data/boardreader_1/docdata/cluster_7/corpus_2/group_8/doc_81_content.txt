Dec 2005       Another I bond Vs US CD question          If I am investing for 1 year, what should I buy I bonds ( 6.73% yield for first 6 months and unknown for next 6 months ) or 4.8% APY US bank CD ?   Link to   Best 1 year CD rates.    Answer:  Let us see how we can analyze this.  We know I bonds have a penalty for last 3 months. That means there will not be any interest for months 10,11 and 12.  Let us start with known 4.84% CD yield.   Deduct 3.37% yield from that, ( 3.37%=half of 6.73% yield ; yield of months 1-6) we get 1.44%. It means we should get 1.44% in 3 months ( months 7 to 9) from I bonds to breakeven with CD yield.  Piece of cake for Super Bond, I mean, I bonds, right ?  Let us check it out..  1.44% for 3 months works out to be 5.74% annual return. We have 1% fixed rate, so the inflation part should return 4.74% APY. For 6 months rate, it is 2.37%.  Our Sep CPI was at 198.8. To gain 2.37% over 198.8, CPI index should hit 203.5 in March 2006. Unfortunately we lost some ground and now after couple of months, the CPI is standing at 197.6, that is below the September level. Nevertheless we have to get 203.5, does not matter where we are today.  So, we need to gain 3% inflation in 4 months. (Dec to Mar). If we dont gain, CD will win I bonds for 12 months holding.   Recall CPI has done 2.85% from March to September in 2005. That was really a BIG GAIN ! Some may feel the CPI can repeat that feat again..  But I don't buy that argument today.   In previous cycle, Katrina, Rita did some major damage and oil prices had skyrocketed. We don't expect hurricanes like that in winter. After that Fed has raised the rate twice. All these points to softer inflation expectation.  In view of these circumstances, I guess US bank CD with 4.8% will beat I bonds for 12 months holding. But it is only a forecast. Anything can happen that could change this forecast.  Final piece of advice: Don't keep all eggs in one basket, even if the basket is labeled as "I BONDS".  Good luck !
