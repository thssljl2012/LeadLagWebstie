Now either all those organisations are incompetent or lying, because its clear they don't have the 'secret' information only available to a select few paying clients.      Morges, I believe you do have the information you say you have, so it opens up an interesting debate.   "Why are all those organisations all saying something different to your secret information?"                      What were all these organisations saying 12 months ago? six months ago? 3 months ago?       I suspect you will find that they keep changing their position. Westpac's report came out and then a few days later their economist was saying he couldnt believe how much worse things had gotten since September (on which their prediction of no recession was based) and the new numbers had shaken him....      If we avoid recession it will be a miracle and large sections of the community will be in recession regardless. Wasnt there a report this week that NSW has been in recession all year already?
