   US dollar mixed Sydney morning as weak US data rekindles recession fears       SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) - The US dollar was mixed against major currencies half way through the morning session in Sydney on Monday after a patchy performance on Friday night, as a  sharp fall in U.S. consumer sentiment and regional manufacturing activity  rekindled fears of a US recession and raised expectations for further interest rate cuts. Consumer sentiment , as measured by the Reuters/University of Michigan index, fell in February to a level not seen since recessions in the last three decades. Additionally, the  New York Fed's Empire State index of factory activit y plunged to the lowest level in almost three years in February. 'These weak US economic reports served to reverse the more optimistic attitude towards the economy which had been triggered by  stronger-than-expected retail sales earlier in the week . They were also an indication of the risks that Fed (Reserve) Chairman (Ben) Bernanke had alluded to in his most recent speech,' said John Kyriakopoulos, head of currency strategy at NAB Capital.   Bernanke  said last week the outlook for the US economy has worsened in recent months due to tight credit and that downside risks to growth have increased.    The weak economic data reinforced concerns about the US economy and fuelled expectations for another interest rate cut.  'Fed Fund futures are now pricing in a 44 percent chance that the  Fed  will ease 75 basis points at their March meeting, up from around 30 percent late Thursday,' said John Noonan, an analyst at Thomson IFR.   'Futures are fully pricing in a 50 basis point cut in March and now project Fed Funds to be 2.0 percent by mid-year as opposed to 2.07 percent late Thursday,' he said.    Elsewhere, the   Australian dollar   was buying 90.80 US cents after rising to 90.72 US cents on Friday amid expectations for the  Reserve Bank of Australia  to continue raising interest rates, record low unemployment and stronger-than-expected economic growth in Japan, a major trading partner of Australia.  _________________________________________________    Friday, 15 February 2008, 16:01 GMT  BBC News     US consumer confidence plummets     Photo - Dearborn truck plant  Sweeping job cuts are worrying consumers     Confidence among US consumers  has fallen to a 16-year low, as fears grow about a recession and job cuts, a closely-watched survey has found.  The University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell to 69.6 in February, from 78.4 in January.  The report said the index had only been this low during past recessions.  Its findings come a day after  Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke  warned that the outlook for the US economy in 2008 is deteriorating.  The Fed cut interest rates twice in January in an attempt to boost both consumer sentiment and the wider economy, both of which have been dragged down by the collapse in the US housing market. Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the latest consumer sentiment data was "just horrible".  "The sustained volatility in the markets, the rise in energy and food prices and, of course, the catastrophe in the housing market, is making consumers extraordinarily miserable," he added.    Separate data on Friday from the Fed showed that  US industrial production  rose a meagre 0.1% in January for the second month in succession.  Keith Hembre, chief economist at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis, described the latest industrial figures as "ugly".  "It's another recession-type reading," he said.  Other US economic data for January has been equally gloomy.  While the  service sector  contracted for the first time in almost five years, overall  employment  levels fell for the first time since August 2003.  Yet at the same time, there was a surprise rise in  retail sales  in January, which increased by 0.3%.  And a survey of  manufacturing activity  in New York also produced a gloomy reading.
