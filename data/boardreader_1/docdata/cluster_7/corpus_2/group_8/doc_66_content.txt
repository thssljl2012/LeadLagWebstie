House sales tumble as slump bites          * August 31, 2008 - 6:18AM      MELBOURNE'S property market has slumped dramatically over the past three months - and by a staggering 44 per cent over the past year.      Figures compiled by The Sunday Age reveal property sales have dropped from 2032 in the first four weeks of August 2007 to 1131 for the comparable period this year.      Hopes that the prospect of a rate cut on Tuesday would boost the market yesterday proved unfounded, with the clearance rate falling below 60 per cent for the first time this year.      Despite reports that buyers are returning to the market, the clearance rate fell 3 percentage points to 59 per cent.      The Real Estate Institute of Victoria's chief executive, Enzo Raimondo, said yesterday's auction results showed that buyers were holding off until the Reserve Bank decided to drop official interest rates.      ''Confidence in the market has not been forthcoming yet,'' he said. ''People are still waiting for an interest rate cut.''      Mr Raimondo said the downturn may even put some real estate agents out of business.      The Sunday Age figures, compiled from REIV data, reveal the true extent of Melbourne's real estate slump. Sales were at least 30 per cent down year-on-year for the three months June to August. The slump was especially marked in July, when only 1100 properties were sold,  compared with 1721 the previous year.      The figures, which include auction results from last weekend, also show sales have slumped by almost 20 per cent over the past year. This amounts to 11,132 homes being sold in Melbourne in 2008, in contrast with 13,791 in the same time period of 2007.      The results are the latest in a number of economic indicators which show Victoria is suffering from a severe property slowdown. On Friday it was announced sales of newly built homes had dropped 7.2 per cent this month, while on the same day the Reserve Bank of Australia released figures showing finance for housing rose just 0.5 per cent in July, the smallestmonthly gain since 1989.      Mr Raimondo said: ''Since last November we've seen interest rate increases from the Reserve Bank as well as increases put on by  individual banks.      ''Those lenders have said that, as a result of the global credit crisis, their borrowing expenses have gone up and they need to pass it on to their customers.      ''All this has meant homeowners have been hit by a series of rate rises in under a year with the direct result that the property market has slowed.''      Households spent 38 per cent of their incomes on mortgage payments in the March quarter, the highest since the institute started  measuring housing affordability 22 years ago.      Households may get some relief on Tuesday when the Reserve Bank is expected to cut its key cash rate to 7 per cent at its monthly policymeeting - the first drop in seven years.         Seems quiet around here without Bunsen, when do you think the carnage in property will end Mr Burner, I seem to recall you would come in here and call all and sundry idiots for not adopting your property purchasing investment mantra, hows the interest bill going? Don't mean to intentionally flame you but you seem pretty quiet whereas in the good times you were forever bucketing any one who had a different opinion, btw no debt and cash in the bank is a nice place to be at the minute.
