The gloomy survey came as an economist formerly with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and now employed by ratings agency Moodys.com, asked whether the Reserve Bank had ''lost the plot'' in assuming positive growth at current levels of interest rates.       http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news...s/1358309.aspx       Looking forward to JJ's positive fan boy spin on this.

The SX 200 fell 3.6 per cent, to 3960.9, led by a 3.8 per cent sell-off in mining stocks, as the initial euphoria surrounding China's plans to reinvigorate its growth with a huge $870billion stimulus package faded.       Confirming that the bleak outlook has spread well beyond financial markets, a National Australia Bank survey showed business confidence last month fell to its lowest level since the survey began in 1997. The bank's index of confidence fell a record 21 points in the month to a new low of minus 29.       Similar pessimism gripped the sharemarket, amid renewed concerns about how businesses will cope in a sharply slowing world economy. The iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group fell 6.9 per cent, to $2.28, and NAB fell 9 per cent after it raised $3 billion in new capital on Monday.      The head of Australian Unity Investments, David Bryant, said some investors were spooked by recent signs that a new and dangerous phase of the credit crunch was unfolding. In particular, fresh fears for the car industry rattled US investors on Tuesday night after a broker predicted General Motors' shares would be worthless within a year.      Domestically, Mr Bryant said, the decisions of Allco Finance Group and ABC Learning Centres to "pull the pin" by going into receivership last week raised the prospect of a second wave of corporate casualties from the credit crunch.      "Allco and ABC Learning seem to have given the impression that the ramifications of the problem are just beginning to filter through. Many investors' conviction that we might finally have had everything out in the open has been shaken a little bit."      The port operator Asciano was the latest victim of market fears as a sell-off wiped out 60 per cent of its market value before it entered a trading halt at 69c.       The NAB survey also said business conditions were near a level not seen since the economy's slowdown in late 2000, and that a quarter of responding companies had experienced credit rationing.       The managing director at White Funds Management, Angus Gluskie, said the steady stream of bleak economic statistics was weighing on the minds of investors, forcing share prices down further. "People are looking at these economic risks, and as they see share prices moving about accordingly it's really building up into a huge wall of fear."       The chief economist at the NAB, Alan Oster, said the decline in confidence and business conditions pointed to the economy's growth slowing to 1.25 per cent in the year ahead.       The Australian dollar also fell, closing at US67.17c compared with US68.50c on Monday.                      http://business.smh.com.au/business/...skin=text-only
