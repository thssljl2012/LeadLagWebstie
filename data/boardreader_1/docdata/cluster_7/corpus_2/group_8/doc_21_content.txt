 Australian   employment   unexpectedly  surged in October by the most in six months, a sign lower interest rates, government handouts and exports may help the economy sidestep a global recession.    The number of people employed gained 34,300, driven by a jump in part-time jobs, after dropping a revised 3,300 in September, the statistics bureau said in Sydney today. The   jobless rate   held at 4.3 percent as more people looked for work.        Shipments of natural resources such as coal and iron ore, which helped boost the nation's trade surplus in September, may underpin economic growth even as the U.S., the U.K. and Japan are threatened by recessions. Reserve Bank Governor   Glenn Stevens   has cut borrowing costs by 2 percentage points since early September in the most aggressive round of rate reductions since the economy was last in a recession in 1991.         ``The strong jobs result will silence the doomsayers, at least for now,''  said   Craig James  , a senior economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney, who was one of only two analysts to tip the increase in a Bloomberg survey.         ``It is a great shot in the arm for the economy. More jobs have been created, meaning there are more people with money to spend.''         The government is trying to stoke consumer spending by giving pensioners, home buyers and families A$10.4 billion ($7 billion) in handouts. The payments are in addition to the biggest income-tax cuts in history, which took effect in July and will add A$5.1 billion to consumer spending in the 12 months through June 2009.               http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...18U&amp;refer=home
