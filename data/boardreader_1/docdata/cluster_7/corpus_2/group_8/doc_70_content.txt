             "Dollar wavers amid central bank actions - Dollar wavers as central banks look to print more money at home and overseas"             Associated Press   Last updated: 4:15 p.m., Tuesday, March 3, 2009        NEW YORK --     The dollar vacillated against the major currencies Tuesday amid interest-rate and policy actions from the Federal Reserve and central banks overseas .               The 16-nation euro inched up to &#036;1.2590 in New York trading from &#036;1.2572 late Monday.   A European Union official said there is a rescue plan in place for any of the euro zone's member countries who could be in danger of defaulting on public debt payments, but would not provide any details.   The British pound rose to &#036;1.4077 from &#036;1.4038, while the dollar firmed to 98.32 Japanese yen from 97.67 yen.           On Tuesday, the Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 0.5 percent, a record low .    The central bank also opened the door to so-called quantitative easing, as the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and Bank of England have already done .    One example of the Fed's push to increase the money supply is the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility .          On Tuesday, the Fed said it would start providing three-year loans on March 25 as a catalyst to unlock the consumer lending market.           The TALF has potential to leverage up to &#036;1 trillion for consumer loans .   Cutting interest rates can prompt economic activity but undermine a currency as investors seek higher returns elsewhere; increasing the money supply can also trigger inflation and dilute a currency's value .          The dollar gained to 1.2880 Canadian dollars following the Bank of Canada's announcement from 1.2871 late Monday.   Also on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia left its key rate unchanged at 3.25 percent, ending a series of cuts that have brought the rate down from 7.25 percent in September amid a slowing economy.   The Australian dollar rose to 64.28 U.S. cents from 63.09 U.S. cents late Monday.   On Thursday, the European Central Bank and Bank of England are expected to announce their latest interest-rate moves, cutting to record lows of 1.5 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.           Investors also want to see if ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will speak about pumping more money into the economy .    The Bank of England could start printing money to buy bank assets as soon as this week, Treasury chief Alistair Darling said in an interview with Britain's The Daily Telegraph .          In other New York trading, the dollar edged down to 1.1748 Swiss francs from 1.1773 francs late Monday.
