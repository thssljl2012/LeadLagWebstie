Interesting times ahead....         Shares poised for new year surge      Cameron England   News Com Au   December 29, 2008        SHARES are expected to surge in January in line with a traditional post-Christmas buying spree and the impact of the various U.S. bailout packages.    However, investors should be wary of another share-market drop in February or March, AMP Capital Investors chief economist Shane Oliver said.       "The Christmas/January period is normally the strongest time of the year for shares as New Year related optimism - or in this case reduced pessimism - usually pushes shares up at a time of low trading volumes," he said.       "Anticipation of more decisive policy action under the incoming Obama Administration (in the U.S.) should help bolster investor confidence in the lead-up to Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20.      Against this though, uncertainty about the economic outlook will ensure a volatile ride and a bout of renewed weakness around February/March next year is possible."       U.S. stocks are expected to post a gradual recovery early next year as Mr Obama moves to drag the world's biggest economy out of recession.       The U.S. stock market has risen about 20 per cent from its lows reached on November 21 and Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities, said "chances that we saw the bottom of the bear (market) have increased because of the massive easing done by the Federal Reserve since then".       This refers to the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing earlier this month it would target its benchmark interest rate in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent, compared with 4.25 per cent in Australia.       Mr Goldman predicted the U.S. recession would be over by the middle of the year with the risk of a depression "extremely unlikely".       Dr Oliver predicted Australia would enter a recession, with unemployment also set to increase from 4.3 per cent to 7 per cent.       He believes interest rates have further to fall.      "The Reserve Bank of Australia is not likely to meet in January, but rate cuts are likely to resume in February with the cash rate falling to around 2.5 per cent by mid-year.
