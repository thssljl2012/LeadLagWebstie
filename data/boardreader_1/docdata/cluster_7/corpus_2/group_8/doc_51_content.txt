 UPDATE: Allison Jackson   March 06, 2009    Article from:  The Australian       AUSSIE shares were caught up in a global sell-off this week as economic conditions deteriorated, and closed down 1.4 per cent today.        The market spent most of the five trading days in the red after several indicators showed Australia was on the brink of recession, while hopes evaporated for a second stimulus package in China, Australias biggest trading partner.       Investors were unnerved by a contraction in fourth-quarter gross domestic product, sharp falls in imports and exports and an unexpected decline in building approvals, which pointed to weak consumer and business spending.       The S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 43 points to 3145.5, for a weekly loss of 6 per cent. It was the lowest close since August 12, 2003.       The benchmark index, which is in the grips of one of the worst bear markets in history, has fallen 15.5 per cent this year and is 54 per cent below its November 2007 peak of 6851.5.       It traded within a whisker of a six-year low today after US markets hit a 12-year low overnight.       The All Ordinaries fell 37.1 points to 3111.7, taking losses over the week to 5.6 per cent.       Intersuisse head of Australian equities Andrew Sekely said: Its been a bad week. The bad news is not easing up in any way, shape or form.       The Australian dollar was slightly higher against the US dollar and the British pound over the week after the Reserve Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged at 3.25 per cent.       Economists expect rates to reach 2 per cent later this year, which is still considerably higher than in other industrialised countries.       ANZ senior analysts Warren Hogan and Tony Morriss said in a report: The economy looks like it is in recession and the worst of the fall-out from the international financial crisis is still to come.       We expect the RBA will respond with another 50 basis points of rate-cuts by mid year. This may come in the form of single 25 basis-point moves in April and May.       There is however, a tangible risk of a 50 basis-point cut in April if the situation deteriorates further over the month ahead.
