                    Re: Random Thoughts                                             Actually maybe you guys can help me. Which question should I do?         Quote:                         The Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is seeking your opinion as a young economist on a number of economic issues. Choose one of the following questions and write an economic report to the PM. Your report should carefully address the main issues, provide a logical economic argument/rationale supporting your view, and be succinct and well readable.    1. The PM wants to know whether the Reserve Bank of Australia&#8217;s inflation target (currently, 2-3 per cent per annum over the business cycle) is appropriate in the face of ever rising oil and food prices globally. Should the inflation target be raised, lowered or maintained? Provide economic rationale supporting your argument.    2. A key concern to Australia is that the Australian economy may not be able to enjoy current economic growth once the strong overseas demand for Australian commodities slows down. What should the Australian government do to keep the economy growing in the long term? Suggest some policies and explain how the policies you suggest ensure that the economy will continue to grow in the long run.    3. Australia&#8217;s rising and persistent current account deficits have often been a cause for concern for many years. Should the Australian government attempt to curb rising current account deficits? Why or why not? How can this be achieved, if so?    4. &#8220;Fiscal policy should not be used for short-term macroeconomic stabilisation but rather be focused on the medium to long-term economic objectives.&#8221; Critically evaluate this statement.     5. The income distribution in Australia has worsened in recent years. Some argue that the strong economic growth over the last decade is to blame for the rise in income inequality. Do you agree or not agree with this argument? Why? Can macroeconomic policy help improve fairer income distribution? If so, how?                     What do you reckon?                                                 __________________       Well done Didaka!
