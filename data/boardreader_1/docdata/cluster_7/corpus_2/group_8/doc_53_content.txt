  Australia's central bank to raise interest rates due to inflation - economists        SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) -  Australia's central bank  is expected to raise interest rates to a 12-year high next week as rising  inflation  outweighs concerns about the recent turmoil in global financial markets and the increasingly bleak outlook for the US economy, economists said Friday.      Most data released this year, including stronger-than-expected  inflation , shows the Australian  economy  continued to  grow at a fast pace  in the last few months of 2007 even as the rest of the world showed signs of slowing, supporting the case for another rate hike when the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meets next Tuesday, they said.      The market's consensus forecast is for a  25 basis points increase , adding to the cumulative 50 basis point increases in August and November.      But the decision to tighten monetary policy has been complicated by the recent rout on global financial markets triggered by concerns the US economy is teetering on the edge of recession, which could have a negative impact on global economic growth and weaken demand for Australian exports, mainly resources.      Furthermore, the recent decision by Australia's leading banks to raise their variable home loan rates independent of a move by the RBA has made the central bank wary of increasing the  financial pressure on homeowners  as they struggle to meet rising mortgage repayments.      NAB Capital chief economist Rob Henderson said he believes one more rate hike will be enough to bring  inflation  back within the central bank's target range of 2-3 percent annual growth and not trigger a severe slowdown in the economy. 'We think the case is still very clear for another increase in interest rates,' said Henderson. 'That's based on the fact that we've got the worst inflation break-out since 1992. Secondly, the data out of Australia remains very strong. Another angle on this is growth in  China  is still very strong, which is underpinning demand for Australian exports, particularly from the  resources sector ,' he said.      The argument for a rate hike was strengthened last month when data showed Australia's  core consumer price index  rose at the fastest pace in 16 years in the fourth quarter, even after two rate hikes in August and November. Core trimmed mean CPI, the RBA's preferred measure of inflation, rose 1.0 percent quarter-on-quarter. The market had expected a 0.8 percent increase.      But a rate hike would come at a time when the  Federal Reserve  is slashing rates to stave off recession in the world's largest economy. In the past two weeks the Fed has reduced rates by 125 basis points following a massive sell-off on global equity markets.      AMP Capital head of investment strategy and chief economist Shane Oliver said the RBA is 'between a rock and a hard place' as it tries to balance the need to rein in inflation while keeping the economy growing for the 17th year in a row. 'I think the Reserve Bank is in a really difficult situation. I can understand the need to keep inflation well anchored and send a strong message that it can't get out of control, but by the same token the slowdown in global growth is suggesting that around the corner there will be a bit of a slowdown in Australian growth and that's going to take a lot of the pressure off inflation,' Oliver said. 'I would think that the best approach is to leave rates on hold, which I think they will do, but it's a pretty close call and it wouldn't surprise me at all if on Tuesday at 2.30 pm we find they did raise rates after all. If they did move it would be a one-off and probably the next move, probably not till next year, will be a rate cut,' Oliver said.
