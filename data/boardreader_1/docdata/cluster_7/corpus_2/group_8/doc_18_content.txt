add USD/JPY chart.     I think it's simply some money in JPY form are exchanged into USD and flow back to US. same thing for chinese yuan. it's a money flow...    it's hard to believe US imports of real products drop by half in a month. gas only drop 2%.    I'm not convinced it's real product import drop.    btw if it's currency exchanged back to USD and capital flow back to US, there is a good reason to do that.    china reduced bank interest by 1/3 in Q4, 2008,   and there is another 1/3 interest reduction for housing loan borrowers from the standard interest rate.    so basically interest rate reduced in half... that basically knocks out the appreciation speculation.    and with CPI drop early this year, there exists the necessity for further reduce rate.     so why not withdraw money out of china if chinese yuan will no longer raise in exchange rate?    esp. for corporates that invested properties in china at very low price, and now they need cash to sustain business. like bank of america.
