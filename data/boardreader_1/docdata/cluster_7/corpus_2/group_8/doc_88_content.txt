The following organisations have said, while Australians growth will slow substantially, it will not fall into (a technical) recession;  OECD, IMF, World Bank, RBA, WestPac, Treasury and there are probably others.    Now either all those organisations are incompetent or lying, because its clear they don't have the 'secret' information only available to a select few paying clients.    Morges, I believe you do have the information you say you have, so it opens up an interesting debate.  "Why are all those organisations all saying something different to your secret information?"
