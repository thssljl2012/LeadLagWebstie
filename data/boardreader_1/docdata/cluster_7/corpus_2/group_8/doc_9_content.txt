It has surged by 40 per cent in the past three years and is forecast to increase by a further 20 per cent in the year ahead.       That has generated  $80 billion in extra tax revenue for the federal government  over the past four years , says a former official of the Department of Finance, Stephen Anthony of the consultancy Macroeconomics.com.au.                      No Treasury compared Howards spending to Whitlams;       http://www.smh.com.au/cgi-bin/common...765054802.html            Quote:                         It turns out the toughest critiques of spending under Howard have not come from Labor but from the Treasury, the department that had to administer the government's irresponsibility.        Treasury was silently smarting under Howard, and, within weeks of last year's election, it vented its frustration. It published a report that compared Howard's fiscal policy with that of that touchstone of recklessness, Gough Whitlam.     Anthony again: "  When the China boom arrived with soaring commodity prices there was no offsetting tightening in fiscal settings to 'bank' windfall revenue gains from mining &#8230; Blind Freddy knew inflation would be the result."     In other words, Howard and Costello blew up the economy to buy their way back into power. They didn't keep power, but they bequeathed Australia an inflationary outbreak.      The Reserve Bank, through higher interest rates, has had to impose the discipline that the government was incapable of applying to its spending.        And consider this damning conclusion from the Treasury report. From the 2004-05 budget to the 2007 election, the China boom and a robust economy had added $334 billion in windfall gains to the budget surplus. Of this, the Howard government spent, or gave away in tax cuts, $314 billion, or 94 per cent. For perspective, this is the size of the entire annual economic output of South Africa or Denmark.      "Effectively, the additional revenue from the commodity boom has been spent, or provided as tax cuts," summarised the paper in the Treasury's summer Economic Roundup.     The author, Paul Cleary, has reported that when East Timor was about to be granted independence, Alexander Downer was asked whether he favoured giving it a larger share of the oil revenues from the Timor Sea. No, said Downer, because the Timorese could not be trusted with windfalls from commodity exports. Downer said they would "piss it up against the wall", wrote Cleary.      Yet this is largely what his own Government did with the proceeds of the Australian commodities boom.                      http://www.smh.com.au/news/peter-har...e#contentSwap2            Quote:                         The ANZ Bank chief economist, Saul Eslake, calculates that, from 2002-03 to 2011-12, the last year of projections included in this week's Rudd-Swan budget, the booming economy has delivered windfall revenues to the Federal Government of $584 billion.                      http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents...ing_growth.pdf        http://petermartin.blogspot.com/2008...-its-past.html            Quote:                         "One third of the measures in the early Howard budgets had a savings component. By the end of the Howard government savings measures averaged just 1.5 per cent of total measures."      The Commonwealth Treasury has launched an assault on the previous government&#8217;s economic priorities and on the growing size of the public service.      The publication of the Treasury&#8217;s assessment of the previous government&#8217;s spending record, available this morning on the Treasury&#8217;s website, follows a speech by the Treasury Secretary Ken Henry this week that attacked both the previous government&#8217;s policy of &#8220;aspirational nationalism&#8221; and the thinking behind its $10 billion water plan.      The Treasury stresses in the document released this morning that the views expressed in it are those of the two authors, Kirsty Laurie and Jason McDonald from the Treasury&#8217;s budget division, and not necessarily those of the department itself...      The release comes as the Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner confirms in an interview in this morning&#8217;s Canberra Times that entire government programs, including tax concessions, are facing his Razor Gang&#8217;s axe.      The Treasury report says that in the past decade of Coalition government inflation-adjusted spending jumped from $175 billion to $261 billion, and is on track to hit $282 billion unless wound back.      It says real government spending grew faster between 2004-05 and 2007-08 than in any four-year period since the 1990&#8217;s recession.      It says the Howard government&#8217;s surge in spending was unusual, along with a surge in spending by the Whitlam government in the 1970s, in taking place at a time when the economy is not in recession.      The economic cost of the surge was much higher than it would have been at another time because the economy was &#8220;operating at close to its limits of capacity&#8221; and resources had to be redirected to the government from other parts of the economy.      Employment in the public service had swelled 29 per cent since 1998 and was likely to be &#8220;reducing the supply of highly educated labour to the rest of the economy&#8221;.      This is because the proportion of public servants with at least a bachelor&#8217;s degree was almost twice that of the private sector &#8211; 40 per cent, compared with 23 per cent.      The number of new decisions announced in each budget had doubled over the Howard decade with most of the new decisions involving relatively small parcels of money each worth less than $100 million over the forward estimates.      However the number of spending decisions worth more than $1 billion had climbed from one in 1997-98 to nine in 2007-08.      By contrast savings measures all but vanished over the life of the Coalition government. The Treasury officers say around one third of all the measures in the 1997-98 budget had a savings component. By the end of the Howard government savings measures averaged 1.5 per cent of total measures.      Tax expenditures, otherwise known as tax breaks or tax concessions soared during the life of the Coalition government. The Treasury says they jumped 51 per cent in real terms since 1997-98, climbing from $33 billion a year to $50 billion and are on track to climb higher still. It warns that this spending has &#8220;similar impacts on the economy to conventional spending.&#8221;      Notwithstanding the recent economic boom, which has cut spending on unemployment benefits, assistance to the aged and families with dependent children had &#8220;grown strongly&#8221;.      Since the onset of the commodities boom in 2003 government spending on industry assistance had climbed by 6 per cent a year.      The Treasury says since 204 the Coalition gained an extra $334 billion in unexpected revenue. It gave away $314 billion of it in new spending or tax cuts.                      http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com....ndout_machine/            Quote:                         Treasury showed last week just how crazy the handouts had become in the final years of the Howard government.       &#8220;The recent growth in spending stands out along with the growth in spending under the Whitlam government in 1974-75 and the increased spending following the recessions in 1982-83 and 1990-91,&#8221; Treasury said. Ouch. Whitlam at least had the excuse of recession in 1974-75, when the budget is supposed to swing into deficit to soften the crash. Howard had the luxury of an economy in its 14th, 15th and 16th year of recovery when he matched Whitlam&#8217;s three-year record between 1972 and 1975.       Perhaps those in the commentariat who call themselves conservatives should read the Treasury report before they pen their next column in defence of the Howard era. Their man left the nation with a budget overloaded with favours just as inflation began to stir, and with the US facing recession.                                                                      __________________       Hearts to Hearts and Hands to Hands!!!
