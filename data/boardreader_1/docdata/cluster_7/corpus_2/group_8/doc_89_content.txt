Now either all those organisations are incompetent or lying, because its clear they don't have the 'secret' information only available to a select few paying clients.      Morges, I believe you do have the information you say you have, so it opens up an interesting debate.   "Why are all those organisations all saying something different to your secret information?"                      CD      I do not really know but if I was to make an educated guess it would be that the ones attached to the investment house are using official data and information from the business and retail sectors, whereas the official guys can only use data as it is released, and most of it lags.      Our people for instance get feedback from the listed companies via the companies pitching for work ie capital raisings, debt roll-over etc (the big end) and they get feedback from the retail end which deals with middle to wealthy Australians.  I know in my case all of my clients were winding back last year, yet you would not see it in the official data for some time.        I mean if that clown from Wetpac 'was shocked', he must be hiding under a rock.  All fo the data coming out now says the world economy virtually stopped in Sept (Lehmans) and he is shocked?  What rock was he under?  US stuffed, Europe stuffed, Japan, stuffed, China slowing down fast.  It all points to trouble.  Throw in the credit crisis whereby good companies cannot raise/roll debt and it is a recipe for recession.      As for the international ones you quote they would not have a clue, they are not based here and rely purely on official data and have no 'feel' for the local economy.
