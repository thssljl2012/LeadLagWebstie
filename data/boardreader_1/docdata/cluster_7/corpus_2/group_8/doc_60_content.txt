  Australia business expectations for Q1 2008 down for first time in 4 quarters        SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) - Australian executives' expectations for profits and sales growth have fallen for the first time in four quarters, with more than 50 percent expecting the tightening credit conditions to have a detrimental impact on their operations in the first quarter of next year, according to a survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) released on Tuesday.      D&amp;B's December survey of business expectations shows that a net 8 percent of  executives expect a year-on-year increase in first-quarter profit, with 32 percent expecting an increase and 24 percent a decrease.       That compares with a net 12 percent of executives expecting profit growth in the December quarter.       A net 19 percent of executives expect sales to grow in the three months to March 2008, with 39 percent anticipating an increase and 20 percent a decrease. That compares with a net 20 percent expecting sales growth in the December quarter.       D&amp;B said 57 percent of executives surveyed expect the tight credit conditions to have a detrimental impact on their operations in the first quarter.      A net 53 percent expect selling prices to increase in the March quarter, with 60 percent expecting to raise prices and 7 percent likely to lower prices. A net 57 percent of them expected increases in the December quarter.       D&amp;B Australasia chief executive Christine Christian said executives are being challenged by tightening credit conditions, continued inflationary pressures and expectations of another rate increase in February.       ''There is a tendency for executives to relax their management of some functions when economic conditions are strong. Now, as we begin to see some challenges creeping into the  market, it is particularly important for businesses to keep a tight rein on operations. This will  help to prevent an additional burden in the New Year,'' Christian said.      While executives are less worried about rising interest rates and fuel prices than they were in the fourth quarter, they still remain key concerns.       D&amp;B said 25 percent consider interest rates their primary concern in the first quarter, compared with 36 percent in the fourth quarter, while 19 percent see fuel prices as the major influence on their operations, down 23 percent in four months and well below the peak of 82 percent in July and August of 2006.      Higher interest rates remain on the horizon for businesses, D&amp;B economist consultant Duncan Ironmonger said.      ''Although the Reserve Bank withheld action on monetary policy last week, increased funding  costs from within the financial sector are expected to result in a further tightening of credit  conditions,'' said Ironmonger.      Most economists expect the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise its target cash rate by 25 basis points to 7 percent in February, adding to the rate rises in November and August, as it tries to curtail inflation.        allison.jackson@thomson.com       aj/nt
