   Stimulants help revive Australia's consumers      By Wayne Cole      SYDNEY, Dec 10 (Reuters) -  Australian consumers  shrugged off global gloom to grow in  confidence  in December as  sharp falls in interest rates  and  petrol prices  gave them the urge to shop again, holding out hope the economy could dodge a deep recession.  The closely-watched  survey of 1,200 consumers  by Westpac Banking Corp and the Melbourne Institute suggested monetary and fiscal stimulus were finally working, a stark contrast to many developed countries were confidence was at or near record lows.  'Today's data confirm that policy has traction and will help temper the depth and duration of this downturn,' said Su-Lin Ong, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets.  'While there are enormous challenges -- notably an impending rise in  unemployment  -- 300 basis points of rate cuts with more to come will see Australia fare better than many other countries,' she added.      The survey's  main index of consumer sentiment  jumped a surprisingly strong 7.5 percent in December. The rise helped recoup all the losses suffered in October, when financial markets turmoil was at its worse.  Treasurer Wayne Swan was pleased that consumers seemed to be heeding his recent call for them to spend for Australia.  'It's just great to see the Australian people backing the Australian economy,' he told reporters after the release of the survey results.      It was taken in the wake of last week's  bold 100 basis-point cut in cash rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)  which took rates to a six-year low of 4.25 percent.  The central bank has now cut rates by 3 full percentage points since September, by far the most aggressive easing campaign since the recession of 1990/91.  And more is expected, with investors already pricing in further cuts in the cash rate to under 3.0 percent next year.  The impact of lower rates was reflected in the  sentiment index for mortgage holders , which jumped 11 percent in December.      Government data out on Wednesday also showed the  number of mortgages committed to  in October rose by 1.3 percent, breaking an eight-month streak of falls.  Since then mortgage rates had come down by almost 175 basis points, making homes more affordable.

The survey's measure of whether now was a good time to buy a major household item surged 28.2 percent in December. Quarterly measures on whether it was a good time to buy a house or a vehicle climbed 39.4 percent and 28.8 percent respectively.  'It is sending a welcome message to beleaguered retailers as they move into the critical last few weeks before Christmas,' said Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans.      As well as lower borrowing costs,  petrol prices  had fallen sharply while a  A$10.4 billion ($6.8 billion) stimulus package  from the Labour government would feed through to incomes in December.  Yet there were plenty of challenges ahead, particularly as consumers had yet to feel the fear of losing a job. The  labour market  has been remarkably resilient so far this year, adding a net 162,100 positions in the 10 months to October.      But a  slump in business confidence  to record lows and mounting anecdotal evidence of  layoffs , suggest the good news is about to end. Official figures on  employment  are due on Thursday and analysts on average are tipping a fall of 15,000 in November, including estimates of as much as a 30,000 drop.  The  jobless rate  is seen rising to 4.5 percent, from 4.3 percent in October, and even the government expects it to climb toward 6 percent by the end of next year.  ($1=A$1.52)
