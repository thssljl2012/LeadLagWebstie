Australia's GDP shrinks 0.5% Q/Q 7:58p ET March 3, 2009 (MarketWatch) HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Australia's gross domestic product shrank 0.5% on a seasonally-adjusted basis in the October-December period from the previous quarter, on weak economic activity in the manufacturing, property and trade sectors, official data showed Wednesday. The data was much weaker than expectations, with economists anticipating a 0.2% increase, according to FactSet. The weak numbers come a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia left its key interest rate unchanged, belying expectations of a reduction. The Australian economy rose 0.3% during the quarter, as compared to the October-December period of 2007
