None of them have gone bankrupt; none of them have been nationalised; none of them have been bought out by other banks; none of them have merged for the sake of self-reservation.  Not a single one.      Meanwhile, our exporters are enjoying the benefits of a weak dollar.                          erm, not true.....      SYDNEY, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Australian insurance and banking group Suncorp-Metway Ltd said it received several approaches for its banking and wealth management operations, which analysts reckon could fetch up to A$5 billion ($3.9 billion), sending its shares up 8.5 percent on Monday.      Moves on Australia&amp;#039;s second-biggest car and home insurer and sixth-biggest bank reflect the impact of the global credit crunch, which has stretched Suncorp&amp;#039;s wholesale funding costs as with Australia&amp;#039;s top bank takeover target, St George Bank Ltd &amp;amp;lt;SGB.AX&amp;amp;gt;, and mooted target BankWest, owned by Britain&amp;#039;s HBOS &amp;amp;lt;HBOS.L&amp;amp;gt;.      Repeat after me &amp;amp;quot;We are not immune, we are not immune&amp;amp;quot;!!!
