         The fall in the Nickel price has pretty much crushed all before it.  An old favourite of mine, Albidon has seen its share price collapse from a height of 215p (albeit driven by bid speculation) to 26.5p today. Luckily I cashed in my chips at 163p but now I&amp;#039;m starting to think seriously about dripping some money back into the stock.  Leaving aside Albidon&amp;#039;s extensive exploration interests and its involvement in the Chirunda uranium JV ( http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=200810020700069... ), the real value in Albidon resides in its 100% Munali nickel project.  Monday&amp;#039;s project update seems to suggest that everything is pretty much on plan, with    - First revenue from sale of concentrates received. - Final completion of construction contract achieved and construction contractor demobilised from site. - Commissioning of the processing plant is progressing well with 900ktpa (2,465tpd) nameplate capacity being exceeded on a number of occasions. - Dedicated power line to Project completed and energised. - Mining development rates on target, stoping operations commenced.    http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=200810130700056...   Plans to upgrade the processing facility throughput to 1.2Mtpa of ore are underway and expected to be achieved in the first quarter of 2009. This will generate between over 10,000 tpa of nickel in a high quality Ni-Cu-Co-PGM concentrate (22m lb)  Munali is a low cost nickel sulphide project. Cash costs were originally estimated at $2/lb (excluding significant cobalt and PGM credits). The company receives 70% of Ni price for its concentrate. Funding for the project was provided by $80m loan from Barclays and $20m subordinated debt from Jinchuan, China&amp;#039;s largest producer of nickel, cobalt and platinum group metals and is a major producer of copper (with which Albidon has an offtake agreement). Recently Albidon cashed in their nickel hedge to crytallise a nice $50m profit. I presume they will hold some of this as cash to secure the repayments on their term loan from Barclays.   http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=200809220700069...   Based on current data  Nickel price                    $5.20/lb Received by Albidon             $3.64/lb Long term cash costs            $2.00/lb (excluding Co/PGM credits) Annual nickel production          22m lb  ANNUAL MINE EBITDA               $36M    Number share in issue          165.2m (all options now underwater) Share price                     26.5p Market capitalisation            44m Market capitalisation            $77m (assuming a 1.75 $/ exchange rate) Net debt                         $50m  ENTERPRISE VALUE                $127M   That values Albidon at around 3.5 time mine ebitda.   Conclusion   Albidon is very attractively valued even at these nickel prices. Any rebound in the nickel price should see Albidon sharply re-rated. It would take a calamitous fall in nickel price to undermine the economics of Munali (at which point most of the nickel mining industry will be in loss). It is lowly geared but nevertheless already should have the surplus cash to secure any loan repayments in the near to medium term future. It has other attractive prospects and should soon generate the cashflow to pursue them. Hopefully most of the commissioning risk at Munali is behind it (famous last words!).
