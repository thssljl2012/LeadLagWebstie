            ROUGH SEAS AHEAD FOR ARUBA       American tourists account for 20-25 percent less Aruba holidays     October 21, 2008, 15:35 (GMT -04:00)     Cabinet members and stakeholders listened attentively to yesterday Ahata-director Rob Smith who briefed the press about the decline of holiday bookings from the U.S..   ORANGE CITY -  The American tourist is 20-25 percent fewer holidays booked for next spring in Aruba   than in the same period last year. There is the expectation that the number of visitors to Aruba this month a few percent less than in 2007. That the director of the tourism branch Ahata, Rob Smith, yesterday informed at a press conference at the Central Bank Aruba (CBA). It was again proclaimed that the first eight months of the year meant a profit for the Aruban tourism sector, with an increase of 13.9 percent over 2007.  In September there were, according to the Ahata many as 11 percent fewer bookings, but this negative trend appears to be in October and the coming months to continue.      Monthly bulletin of the Central Bank of Aruba for August 2008    October 15, 2008  The Aruba Tourism Authority has a backlog in its official publication of statistics on tourist arrivalsand nights spent on the island for the months of January 2008 up to and including August 2008.However, airport arrivals, which can be considered an approximation for tourist arrivals, registered a 3.1 percent increase in August 2008, compared to August 2007.  During the first eight months of 2008 airport arrivals rose by 13.9 percent, compared to the same period in 2007. Data on the average occupancy rate of hotels, provided by the Central Bureau of Statistics, show a 3.2 percentage points decrease to 78.6 percent in August 2008, compared to a year earlier.   The Cruise Tourism Authority reported a decline in the number of cruise passengers and ship calls of, respectively, 18.0 percent and 78.6 percent  (from 14 ships to 3 ships)  in August 2008, compared to the corresponding month of 2007 .    RABID INFLATION    In August 2008, the consumer price index increased by 11.2 percent compared to the corresponding month in 2007. The 12-month average inflation rate accelerated to 8.7 percent, compared to 4.2 percent in August 2007.   The inflation differential with the United States widened to 4.4 percentage points, up from 2.2 percentage points in August 2007. When excluding the energy-related components (water, electricity and gasoline), the 12-month inflation rate went up by 1.2 percentage points to 5.1 percent in August 2008, compared to the corresponding period a year earlier. Given the nature of the causes of the present price pressure, which reflects largely cost-push factors, and the current modest bank credit development, the CBA is of the opinion that restricting monetary policy at this point could further hamper economic growth, while not necessarily tempering inflationary pressures.
