St George cross collateralise everything through their advantage package.  Bad practice in my opinion.  It&amp;#039;s interesting also that their fees are going up to match Westpac&amp;#039;s, at the same time the merger has been approved.  I think those who have a St George loan today will find themselves with a Westpac loan in 3 years.      Every major bank will give you the same rates through both the bank and the broker distribution channels.  I&amp;#039;ve had many cases where the branch makes a &amp;#039;special offer&amp;#039; and I&amp;#039;m then able to match that offer.  In some cases the broker channel is even cheaper - there&amp;#039;s a lot of people out there with a 0.5% discount on their CBA Wealth package.
