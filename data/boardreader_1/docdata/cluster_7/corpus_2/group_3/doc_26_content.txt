the Japanese discount rate was lowered from 0.5% to 0.1% in 2001 to keep up with volume and held until 2006...Then the US Consumer could no longer sustain requesting commercial banks to manufacture the required amount of new money to service the continued existance of the previously requested money. Causing the volume Japan needed to sustain the 0.1% discount rate and it began rising in search of yield to 0.5%...causing the carry trade to slow significantly...which in teren cause the Iceland banking sector to cave in.      0.1% to 0.5% is a 500% increase in rates.
