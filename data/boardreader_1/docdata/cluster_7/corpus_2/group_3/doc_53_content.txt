                                The RBA rate in Australia is 7%. If it&amp;#039;s possible to get something closer to that from ,say, Commonwealth Bank without having to lock in your money long term I&amp;#039;d say open an Australian account. (this is assuming you&amp;#039;re willing to take the risk that the Aussie currency won&amp;#039;t fall somemore due to possible further cuts in interest rates). At 7% you will be charged withholding tax but that is more than the 4.08% by RHB. Besides, RHB is a Malaysian bank, isn&amp;#039;t it better to open directly with an Australian bank?

RHB singapore is offering a 4.08%p.a interest in its aussie dollar account. should i open an account here with RHB or should i open 1 when i go over?
