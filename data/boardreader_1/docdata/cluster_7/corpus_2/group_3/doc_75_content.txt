I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s to hard to get a .7% discount on the wealth package with CBA. Early last year I only had 150k in borrowings with them and was still getting the discount. I deal directly by phone with there home loans division in Brisbane (even though I am in Perth) and they have been exceptional. I guess by doing this directly it gives them more scope to discount. Also they seem to have a lot more knowledge than the local branch and can structure things to get a mortgage application through to approval.
