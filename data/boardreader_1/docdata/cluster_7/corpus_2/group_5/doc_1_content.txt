SYDNEY, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Australian bank ANZ has said it will cut another 400 jobs by the end of this year, bringing the total to around 800 as it struggles with the global financial crisis, local newspaper reports said on Saturday.    According to the reports, Chief executive Mike Smith told staff at the bank&amp;#039;s Melbourne headquarters on Friday about the new cuts. The bank has already shed around 400 staff and the latest move follows a wave of banking job cuts in Australia.    Most of the cuts will take place in middle management position in Australia and New Zealand.    In an email to staff Smith said the cuts would be &amp;#039;tough at every level.&amp;#039;    &amp;#039;While no one likes job losses, we have tried to ensure that in difficult circumstances our managers have all the help and support necessary to manage the situation and that all our employees, those departing and those staying, are treated consistently and with dignity,&amp;#039; Smith said in the email, as quoted by The Sydney Morning Herald.    Smith also warned that the effects of the current global financial crisis would last for at least another two years.    The 800 jobs lost represent around 2 percent of the bank&amp;#039;s workforce, reports said.    ANZ has reportedly set aside near A$2 billion (US$1.3 billion) to cover potentially bad debts from lending to risky clients.
