Weeellllllllllllllllll      Looks like Ruddy&amp;#039;s stimulus package is not working for the housing sector!!       http://business.theage.com.au/busine...1204-6r46.html       New home building approvals tumbled in October to their lowest level since March 2001 as the Government&amp;#039;s stimulus package and rate cuts failed to ease fears about the future of the economy.      Building approvals fell 5.4% to 10,730 in October, seasonally adjusted, from an upwardly revised 11,339 units in September, the Australian Bureau of Statistics says.      The market forecast was for building approvals to have recorded a rise of 0.7% in October.      St George Bank chief economist Besa Deda said October saw both rate cuts and the Federal Government&amp;#039;s $10.4 billion stimulus package aimed in part at prospective home buyers.      &amp;amp;quot;But what dominated that month has been the intensification of the credit crisis and  the ensuring caution among households,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; she said.
