Here it comes!!!!!!  Job ads plummet.       http://business.theage.com.au/busine...1208-6tls.html       Jobs advertised online and in newspapers tumbled 8.6% in November from the previous month to an average of 211,199 per week, taking it 18.6% lower than a year earlier, according to ANZ Bank.      The steep drop is the seventh consecutive contraction of the gauge, and the deepest dive since ANZ began releasing the data on a monthly basis in 1999. In trend terms, total job ads dropped 3.5% in November.      &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Over the last two months, newspaper job advertising has declined by the most in the 30-year history of the survey,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said ANZ head of Australian economics Warren Hogan in a statement. &amp;#039;&amp;#039;This tells us that hiring intentions have been heavily impacted by the latest wave of uncertainty and financial distress caused by the global financial crisis.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;
