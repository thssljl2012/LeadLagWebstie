As Robert Hall, an economist at Stanford University, notes, earlier recessions, like that of the early 1980s, were caused by the Fed raising interest rates sharply to squelch emerging inflation and holding them high even once the recession began. In the current and past two recessions, interest rates never got very high and the Fed actually began to lower them before the contraction began. In a paper written a year ago*, Mr Hall described such apparently &amp;amp;#8220;causeless&amp;amp;#8221; recessions as perplexing.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;Mr Hall is chairman of the committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, an academic group that &amp;amp;#8220;officially&amp;amp;#8221; declares when recessions begin and end.  He now says that the current episode fits the &amp;amp;#8220;modern recession&amp;amp;#8221; template not just in the lack of a significant monetary spark, but also in the divergence between employment and output.  It used to be that full-time employment fell more slowly than output around recessions; since 1990 it has fallen as, or more, quickly. While employment has declined steadily since December, real GDP as of the third quarter was still above its level at the end of 2007.&amp;amp;quot;                       Show me that Mr Hall forecasted this recession 3-4 years ago.  If he did not, his opinion should immediately be dismissed.      Anyone can find an economic forecast to post that supports their position.  I was looking for YOUR opinion as to why this may not be a devasting recession.  This man&amp;#039;s opinion is in the vast minority.  He&amp;#039;s probably one of the same people who thought &amp;amp;quot;everything was fine&amp;amp;quot; back in 2005.      I can tell you right now, this man is wrong.  Not only is he wrong, he&amp;#039;s going to be embaressed as we move forward.  Time will tell.      Here are the facts from my own mind rather than someone&amp;#039;s opinion;      -Our economy &amp;amp;quot;should&amp;amp;quot; have been in recession back in the early 2000&amp;#039;s, but propped up real estate values prevented that from really happenig.      -The above real estate bubble over-inflated the investment markets by as much as 30%.      -The 2 above facts gave the avg American the illusion of wealth and persuaded them to consume on credit more than they should have and created tremendous debt.      -Our economy became more and more reliant upon &amp;amp;quot;consumption&amp;amp;quot; to the point where it generated almost 70% of our total GDP.  The only way this can be sustained is if they are consuming products made in the USA...and that&amp;#039;s not the case.      -No economy can rely upon &amp;amp;quot;consumption&amp;amp;quot; for the vast majority of it&amp;#039;s GDP.  Economies can only be sustained through PRODUCTION of goods.      -Americans will never again spend or consume the way they did in the past 10 years as we are entering a new era of saving, debt reduction and frugality.      -Our GDP won&amp;#039;t reach 2004/2005 levels for another 7-10 years.  If you don&amp;#039;t agree, tell me what could generate this increase in GDP since consumers won&amp;#039;t be spending.      -All our major banks are currently holding TRILLIONS in loan derivatives, a high percentage which will go bad (toxic).  The recent $700 billion bailout is a drop in the bucket compared to this total.  For example, Citibank is holding over $900 billion in derivatives.      In the end, one year from now, we&amp;#039;ll have an idea who is right and who is wrong.  Not many have their money where you are and that number is decreasing everyday.      If you want an accurate economic forecast, you should stick with the most highly regarded economists...the ones that forecasted this recession.  That would be men like  Nouriel Roubini  and  Peter Schiff .  If someone forecasted a healthy economy for 2008 2-3 years ago, they should immediately be dismissed as frauds.
