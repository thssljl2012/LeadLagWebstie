Atlanta, GA (PRWEB) March 10, 2009 -- Liaison Technologies, a global leader in data management and integration managed services, announced today it has entered into a strategic partner agreement with SOPERA GmbH, a leading open source software and SOA platform provider.  Liaison and SOPERA have committed to interoperability and optimization between their respective platforms, including participation in joint roadmap efforts and cooperation in support of joint customer activities.  Forward thinking organizations are looking for better ways to get more out of their existing enterprise systems and applications. With limited resources and slashed IT budgets, companies are looking for collaborative solutions that reduce the costs associated with enterprise integration, infrastructure, and business process management.                                                                             We have seen tremendous demand for ESB management solutions across Europe. Many companies have outgrown their custom, script-based management solutions, but are not satisfied with or willing to invest in simple data mapping tools.                                                                                                                                     Liaison is committed to delivering solutions and services to help companies cost-effectively migrate to a portable mapping format that can preserve their intellectual property and expand their future integration options                                                                                                                                     We are excited about the potential that this preferred partnership offers, and dedicated to build on the unique, powerful and flexible services that both companies provide to the market.                                                                          With Liaison's Contivo, a SOPERA certified data integration solution, IT organizations can access, discover, cleanse, integrate, and deliver timely, trustworthy data to the extended enterprise to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Unlike other unsupported mapping solutions, Contivo is a preferred mapping engine with SOPERA that simplifies the data integration process by enabling the migration of maps and business logic from legacy EDI translators to an open and portable format. As an ESB provider, SOPERA creates access to one of the most innovative and mature SOA platforms on the market - based on the best-practices of SOA pioneer Deutsche Post. SOPERA's distributed, modular, open standards platform facilitates flexible and rapid enterprise implementation of an SOA strategy.  "We have seen tremendous demand for ESB management solutions across Europe. Many companies have outgrown their custom, script-based management solutions, but are not satisfied with or willing to invest in simple data mapping tools." said Harald Weimer, CEO, SOPERA GmbH.  Both companies see considerable value from a strong integration between the technologies. With its SOPERA certified Contivo solution, Liaison has already proven the process, from initial map building, automatically applying incremental changes to maps, to automatically generating optimized runtime code to execute on the SOPERA ESB platform.   "Liaison is committed to delivering solutions and services to help companies cost-effectively migrate to a portable mapping format that can preserve their intellectual property and expand their future integration options" said Bob Renner, CEO of Liaison Technologies. "We are excited about the potential that this preferred partnership offers, and dedicated to build on the unique, powerful and flexible services that both companies provide to the market."
