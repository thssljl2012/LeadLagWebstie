     ANZ National has announced nearly 100 proposed job cuts this week, most of which are the latest in the banks move to cut costs by offshoring work to Bangalore. Finsec says the bank has also backed away from prior public commitments to provide all affected staff other work if they wanted it. When ANZ National first announced its intention to offshore jobs they promised workers and the public that all staff could have another role. The bank is now backing away from their promise of a job for all when their workers most need that promise to be kept, said Campbell. Campbell said that ANZ National CEO Graham Hodges will be attending the governments upcoming Jobs Summit and should use the opportunity of the summit to commit to protecting New Zealand jobs in his own bank. The best thing that Graham Hodges can do to support New Zealand jobs is to keep his current staff in work. We call on him to front up to the jobs summit and pledge to offer an alternative job to all staff affected by his offshoring.
