Source : SCMP Jane Cai in Beijing Apr 25, 2009 China Construction Bank (SEHK: 0939) Corp said yesterday first-quarter net profit dropped 18.25 per cent, hit by shrinking net interest margins and rising impairment provisions. Construction Bank, the world's second-largest lender by market value, recorded 26.26 billion yuan (HK$29.81 billion) in attributable net earnings in the quarter. That was in line with forecasts by analysts at Macquarie, UBS and Fox-Pitt Kelton (Asia). The bank's performance reflected the impact of opposing forces, said Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst Warren Blight. He said its net interest margin contracted, hurting profits, although loans grew strongly. Net interest income dropped 6.55 per cent to 50.87 billion yuan, while net interest margin shrank 0.66 percentage point on the year to 2.46 per cent, hurt by five interest rate cuts since September last year. The benchmark one-year lending rate has been lowered from 7.47 per cent to 5.31 per cent as the mainland authorities aim to boost liquidity to make funds more accessible to struggling firms.The margin pain was exacerbated by the cut in favourable mortgage rates to 30 per cent below the base rate from 15 per cent earlier this year. Net fee and commission income rose 10.43 per cent on the year as asset markets improved in recent months. New loans and advances reached 4.2 trillion yuan, an increase of 14.14 per cent from the end of last year. Loans to the infrastructure sector increased 18.83 per cent from December last year. The bank's non-performing loan ratio improved from 2.21 per cent at the end of December to 1.9 per cent at the end of last month. Pang Xiusheng, the bank's chief financial officer, said the profit decline was mainly because the bank made a large amount of provisions which was almost equal to that in the fourth quarter. "Impairment losses increased 7.44 billion yuan from the same period last year as assets grew and we made adequate provisions on a prudent basis," the lender said in a statement. The provisions soared 84.2 per cent year on year to 50.82 billion yuan last year, including 29 billion yuan marked in the fourth quarter last year. Profit before provisions and tax totalled 42.97 billion yuan, about the same as the year-ago period. Mr Pang said he was confident that the bank's full-year results for this year would beat analysts' expectations, Reuters reported. Fox-Pitt Kelton said the bank's net profit would drop 1 per cent this year and rise 6 per cent next year. Bank of America Corp holds 16.73 per cent of the mainland lender. With the looming expiry of a lock-up on a stake of about 6 per cent in Construction Bank on May 7, the mainland lender's share price would be under pressure in the near term, analysts said. Construction Bank's H shares ended up 0.91 per cent at HK$4.42 yesterday, while its A shares closed 0.23 per cent lower at 4.35 yuan. The bank's fourth-quarter earnings dropped 30 per cent on higher than expected provisions, while net profit for the full year rose 34 per cent to 92.59 billion yuan.
