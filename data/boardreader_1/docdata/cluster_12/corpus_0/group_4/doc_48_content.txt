Santander, Britain's second largest retail bank, has this morning announced a surprise 7.2bn rights issue.  This is the Spanish banking group who 'rescued' Bradford &amp; Bingley, and who owns Abbey and Alliance &amp; Leicester in the UK.  The really odd bit - reports are suggesting that Bank of America subsidiary Merrill Lynch will act as the underwriter.  So, the Spanish banking giant who was heralded as a saviour of the British banking sector is now turning to shareholders to raise more capital (a lot more capital!) and using a US government-supported failed investment bank to underwrite the issue.    How much lower can the global banking sector sink?  Kindest regards, Martin    Martin Bamford BA (Hons) CFP APFS Chartered Financial Planner at Informed Choice IFA and Personal Finance Author
