 Over the past year, thousands of people have been part of the anti-coal movement taking action against the coal and coal finance sectors. AND the struggle continues. On Nov. 14-15, We need all of you to join RAN, Greenpeace, Rising Tide, Southern Energy Network, Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC), Heartwood, Coal River Mountain Watch, Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, Black Mesa Water Coalition, Mountain Justice, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Coop America and thousands of others during the National Day of Action against Coal and Coal Finance in confronting mining companies, utilities, and the biggest funders of the coal industry: Citi and Bank of America.  If were going to avert the worst effects of climate change, we need to stop investing in coal and make an immediate transition to renewable energies. This is only going to happen if we can show the world that people everywhere care about the climate and want action now! Already actions are planned in more than 50 cities across the United States. All you have to do is show up and add your voice; the power of these actions depends on your participation. Check here for a map of actions. Cant find one but want to do something?  You can still sign up here to round up some friends and organize your own action. See you in the streets!  Posted in global warming&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
