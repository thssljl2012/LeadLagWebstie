Congratulations to Xero who have just announced that the first of the  Australian banks has come on board and is providing direct automaticfeeds into  Xero. As Lucy says; NAB will be providing this integral and  innovative service in December for NAB customers using Xero. As soon as the feeds are live, we will let you know how to add your NAB  account to this convenient service. Achieving the link between bank and Xero is not a trivial task and it has  taken many months to get to this point. Thank you to the many staff at NAB who  have worked with us to make things easier for small business owners in  Australia. Aussies tend to be a little like sheep - the first one through the gate is  the hardest - my pick is that a bunch of other banks will follow suit and within  a short space of time the majority of the major operators are on board. It&amp;#8217;s a great progress pint for Xero but even more interesting is how much  extra leverage this will give within the UK market where the banks there have  been somewhat backwards in coming forwards. Watch this space!
