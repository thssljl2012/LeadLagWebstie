I learnt something today. I used to think that St George is a very hazy, undefinedarea of Sydney that is more famous for it&amp;#8217;s football team and hospital than it is for having a postcode that is recognised by Australia Post. Or maybe St George is a bank that used to be a big strong dragon who loved Julie Anthony, but now itis about to bedisabled bya stickyWetpatch in a nasty orgy of corporate seduction&amp;#8230; Sorry&amp;#8230; I mean Westpac made love to the Dragon&amp;#8230; Or maybe St George was some significant figure in English History&amp;#8230;. However, I am truly enlightened now - there is also a town in Queensland that is called St George. It is out in the country, and it has it&amp;#8217;s own mayor, whose name is Donna Stewart. Donna got voted as mayor of the Balonney Shire Council with 1,694 votes. Balonney Shire Council includes St George. Maybe it also includes other towns. But they are less significant than St George. You may wonder why I am interested in Balonney &amp;amp; St George. I was amazed to see the mayor of Balonney, as I think there is an uncanny link to the Sydney&amp;#8217;s mayor,Clover Moore&amp;#8230;. Take a look at these pictures&amp;#8230;. it raises so many potentialissues&amp;#8230;.                                             There are a few possibilities: a) Clover Moore is moonlighting as the mayor of Balonney, as well as being the mayor of Sydney and the state member for Sydney; b) Donna Stewart and Clover Moore are long lost sisters; c) Australian people are smart enough to vote for the best woman or man for the job. My interest in St George and Balonney shire was sparked by an intertesting story that examines how the mayor of Balonne isfighting to prevent the Federal government from buying water rights in the Balonneregion. Even though less than 2,000 peoplevote for the mayor of Balonne, they use more water than the whole of Sydneyeach year. Irrigators in Balonne Shire useover 700gigalitres of water every year. In the meantime,the whole of Sydney&amp;#8217;s 4 million peopleuseless than this amount of water per year - around 630 gigalites. Admittedly, Sydney is not a farming community, but it is quite horrifying to think about a community that is using water to such a huge extent, when there is such a huge water shortage in this country. The people of this community should not be blamed directly for this issue, but it would be good to see community leaders working together to fix the bigger problems for the whole country. It seems like this community needs some outside help to develop new industries that do not need so much water. 700 gigalitres is nearly the equivalent of 2 Sydney Harbours each year - that is a shit load of water&amp;#8230;. especially when it is highly likely that water will dry up over time in the next few years. It seems to me that it is sensible to start cutting back on water use. But as an entire community across the whole of Australia, we also need to look at how we an help these communities in the longer term&amp;#8230; especially if the people have had the wisdom to vote for a Clover Moore protege!!&amp;#8230;. ...
