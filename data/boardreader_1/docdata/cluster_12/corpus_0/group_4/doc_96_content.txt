Ganked from jeffla and kitchenbeard and some info pointed out by technocowboyIf you're angry that a church can meddle with another state's political statutes, here's something that you can do.To report the LDS Church to the IRS, simply take 5 minutes to print these articles out and any others you can find:http://www.sltrib.com/ci_10839546http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_10842051Then print and fill out http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3949a.pdfList the taxpayer as:Thomas S. Monson, et al50 East North TempleSalt Lake City, Utah 84150List his occupation as President and the business as the ridiculously full name of the church (same address).Check the boxes for False Exemption and Public/Political Corruption.Then in the Comments section demand that the LDS Church be fined and their tax-exempt status revoked for repeated and blatant violations of the IRS's separate of church and state rules, and for conspiring to interfere with a state's political process.Check Yes under "Are books/records available?" and write in "campaign finance records."You don't have to provide any of your own personal info. Mail the form and the printed articles to:Internal Revenue ServiceFresno, CA 93888I can't confirm the truth to this or not, but I'm researching this info below:____________________________________________________________________________________The Mormon Church and its members were some of the largest donors in Californias Proposition 8 measure.Universally, we need to avoid putting any more money into the Churchs coffers by boycotting all companies where a Mormon church member holds an officers position or a large majority interest.
