                   Already this year many companies have made cuts in regards to their staffing levels to combat the global recession. This week alone ANZ National Bank have cut 3000 to 5000 staff across the board and Air NZ have so far cut 200 staff and cant rule out more, included in the cuts is they are standing down 1 aircraft with another expected to join it. Only the larger companies have made national headlines but there are still many more companies making cuts primarily those that deal in areas of Finance, Motor Vehicles and Realty. such as recruitment companies, Car Sales (new vehicle sales) and finance companies. Companies are also reducing costs on how they deal with their staff christmas functions. Several have cancelled outright whereas others are seeking cheaper alternatives leaving function facilities such as hotels and conference centres short on catering and planned events. In fact smaller business such as taverns are reaping this business holding/booking christmas functions as they allow a lower priced business expense. Still only time will tell of the battle ground being fought on to create new business and keep the profits rolling in.
