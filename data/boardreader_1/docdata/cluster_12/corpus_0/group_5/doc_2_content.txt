     Finsec has slammed ANZ Nationals application to the Department of Labour for an exemption to make it easier for the bank to hire non-residents in certain roles, in light of the bank cutting around 900 jobs this year. The rules of the Department of Labour scheme require companies to have a high standard and commitment to training and employing New Zealand residents in order to gain accreditation that allows them to fast track the appointment of non-residents. This year, ANZ National has announced plans to send around 500 jobs to India, cut around 200 frontline jobs in ANZ branches, announced plans to make about 200 management roles redundant and the tax payer has agreed to underwrite their deposits and borrowing. Now they want the state to support their choice of employing non-residents during a recession when local unemployment is rising, said Finsec Campaigns Director Andrew Campbell. In these circumstances, our largest employer should be made to employ and train locals to fill such vacancies. There are plenty of people within the bank who have been or are about to be made redundant and who are looking for jobs, said Campbell.
