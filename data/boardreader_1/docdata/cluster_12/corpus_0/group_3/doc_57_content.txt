Andy Zaky has a bone to pick with Wall Street &amp;#8212; or rather, with the professional analysts who cover Apple (AAPL)at Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and the rest. &amp;#8220;I could write a book on what Wall Street analysts don&amp;#8217;t know,&amp;#8221; he says. &amp;#8220;A fifth grader could make better forecasts.&amp;#8221; An Apple enthusiast and small-scale investor, Zaky writes a financial blog called Bullish Cross and regularly posts his findings on Seeking Alpha, a popular venue for stock pickers, money managers and investment newletter publishers. He&amp;#8217;s one of a small group of unpaid analysts who follow Apple so closely that their private predictions of the company&amp;#8217;s sales and earnings are often more accurate than those offered clients by the pros. Zaky&amp;#8217;s estimates for Apple&amp;#8217;s second fiscal quarter, in particular, were spot on. (See here.) So with only days to go before the fourth quarter earnings call that Apple has scheduled for 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Oct. 21, Zaky has put together a chart comparing the Q4 estimates of the leading Wall Street Apple analysts with those generated by what he calls the &amp;#8220;real analysts&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; specifically, himself, Financial Alchemist&amp;#8217;s Turley Muller, and an anonymous investor who writes under the pen name Deagol (after a J.R.R. Tolkien character). All three are active participants at the two leading Apple investor sites, The Mac Observer&amp;#8217;s Apple Finance Board and Investor Village&amp;#8217;s private AAPL Sanity (registration required), where they have attracted a loyal following. The chart below represents Zaky&amp;#8217;s survey as of Sunday morning. It&amp;#8217;s a work in progress and may contain errors; analysts with corrections or updates are welcome to mail them here.  As you can see, the unpaid analysts are considerably more sanguine about Apple&amp;#8217;s performance for the quarter ended Sept. 30 than are the men and women who do it for a living. Zaky&amp;#8217;s estimate for iPhones sold in Q4, for instance, is 85% higher than the Street&amp;#8217;s (7.5 million units vs. 4.0 million). He&amp;#8217;s confident that he&amp;#8217;s right, however, and is happy to explain where he gets his numbers: &amp;#8220;I have charts and trend for every single data point in Apple&amp;#8217;s financial statement as do Muller and Deagol,&amp;#8221; he writes. &amp;#8220;For instance, the iPhone number is supported by NPD Data, Muller&amp;#8217;s interpretation of net application OS market share and IMEI Number tracking by Mac Observer [see here]. Our computer sales number is supported by NPD, Gartner and IDC data. I can tell you right now that the Mac number will not deviate significantly from our forecast&amp;#8230;. The 11 million iPod number we arrive at comes from NPD data and [Piper Jaffray analyst] Gene Munster&amp;#8217;s unusual ability to give almost perfect forecasts on that iPod data.&amp;#8221; We&amp;#8217;ll revisit these estimates after the quarterly earnings report and see how well Zaky and the amateurs did.
