In co-operation with large Institutional Investors (HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Chase, etc.), we have created a process for requesting customized bulk REO packages for buyers. These Institutional Investors are constantly reorganizing their portfolio to maintain regulatory and liquidity requirements, which allows them to release a percentage of their REOs for bulk sale. We have these opportunities available immediately. Our requests are compiled on a first-come, first-serve basis. We are direct to the sellers mandate! In order to complete the requests accurately and in a timely manner we need the following documents:   Letter of Intent  Identification Card  Proof of Funds  After documents are reviewed, an executive draft of the Non-Disclosure / Non-Circumvention (NCND) agreement and a Master Fee Agreement (MFA) is issued.No more than 2 intermediaries (Buyer and Seller) are recognized by seller, and they should both be named on the LOI. The PerDare Group is the sellers intermediary - all other intermediaries need to go under Sub-Fee Agreement which can be paid out to a paymaster and distributed accordingly.All Buyer and Seller proofing, actions, instructions, transfers, closing and funds disbursement are performed by Title I Escrow Company. Usual sequence is 3 business days to review summary tape and provide decision; 7-15 business days for due diligence (depending on institution); 1-2 days for Buyer and Seller final negotiation; 1-2 days for closing. If interested or if you have any questions regarding this process please contact me  (WARNING) if you see a post from FLIPPER 101 please disregard. He is a problem starter as you can clearly see from his other posts on this site to other individuals. He is a liar and constant harraser!
