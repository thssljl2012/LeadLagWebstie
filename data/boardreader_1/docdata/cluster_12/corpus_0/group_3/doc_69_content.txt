Back in the days of ancient Greece they put Athens' gold on display up in the Parthenon. In fact, they built a reflecting pool in front of the gold so the sun would hit the gold, the gold would reflect off the pool and the whole dang place would light up so people down below could see their wealth. Not a bad idea until people come to take the gold and blow the joint up.But I digress.I wonder where your town's money is invested. What have market conditions done to:Pension funds (The state pension fund in Massachussetts, for example, has lost $8 billion of its value.)Prepaid college tuition programsPending bond issues to build roads, hospitals and suchThe New York Times said:With tax receipts from retail sales and property values plummeting as unemployment rises along with fuel costs, city officials ... across the country say they are feeling increasingly squeezed and helpless as the national economic crisis eats away at the core sources of municipal revenue.Add to that the abrupt and unexpected loss over the last several weeks of usually sound investments and credit in the municipal bond markets -- the place to which local governments turn for relatively cheap, fast money -- and it becomes clear that cities are facing their own financial crisis, arguably the worst in decades.In Duluth [Minn.], for instance, a $3 million investment the city made last summer through Merrill Lynch, which was sold to Bank of America last month, was liquidated and came back last week $2.25 million short -- a devastating setback for a city.The story says big cities are hurting even more than small towns. The National League of Cities surveyed 300 cities and towns and found that "64 percent of city finance officers surveyed expect cities to have a harder time meeting fiscal needs in 2008, and 79 percent forecast even bigger problems ahead in 2009."The Times pointed out:"This is the first time for at least two decades that all three major general tax sources -- property, income and sales -- have all declined at the same time," said Michael A. Pagano, a co-author of the report and dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, Chicago. "Thats the real frightening thing for cities."
