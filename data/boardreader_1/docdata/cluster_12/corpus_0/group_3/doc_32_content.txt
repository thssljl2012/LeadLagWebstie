 It is being reported today that the once proud Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) will be the first U.K. bank to turn to the government for a capital infusion.&amp;nbsp; The number being talked about is $17 billion.&amp;nbsp; Talk about a good franchise just blowing its face off.&amp;nbsp; RBS already had plenty of exposure to U.S. residential mortgages with their Greenwich Capital unit here in the states.&amp;nbsp; They then got into a insane battle with Barclays over the U.S. mortgage banking arm of ABN Amro.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately for RBS they won.&amp;nbsp; I guess for Barclays it's better to be lucky than good.&amp;nbsp; ABN has been a bad joke in the U.S. for a long time.&amp;nbsp; Now it can be said that they helped take down a British bank and a Belgian bank (Fortis, who ended up sharing ABN with RBS).&amp;nbsp; Bravo ABN.  Anyway, it is expected that CEO Fred Goodwin will be stepping down.&amp;nbsp; It seems like ages ago that Mr. Goodwin told us that RBS was in fine shape and didn't need any capital.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately it was only eight months ago!&amp;nbsp; Here is a song I wrote back in April when the bank that didn't need any capital announced it was going to raise, $24 billion in a rights issuance, just to be safe.  Finally, I wrote a song in honor of Royal Bank of Scotlands capital raise today. For the happy shareholders. Im sorry if the song pre or post dates you.
