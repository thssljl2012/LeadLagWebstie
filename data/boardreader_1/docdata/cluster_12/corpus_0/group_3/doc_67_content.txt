16th OCTOBER &amp;quot;NATIONAL BOSS'S DAY&amp;quot;  Patricia Bays Haroski registered &amp;quot;National Boss's Day&amp;quot; with the U.S.Chamber of Commerce in 1958. She was working as a secretary for StateFarm Insurance Company in Deerfield, Illinois at the time and choseOctober 16th because it was the birthday of her boss, who happened to beher father.Four years later in 1962, Illinois Governor Otto Kerner backed Haroski'sregistration and officially proclaimed the day.National Boss's Day has become an international celebration in recentyears and now is observed in countries such as England, Australia andSouth Africa.Hallmark did not offer a Boss's Day card for sale until 1979, butincreased the size of its National Boss Day line by 90 percent in 2007by creating collections of new and innovative cards.Happy Boss's Day
