        Firethorn (owned by Qualcomm) has a new iPhone app called Mobile Banking for AT&amp;T Customers. The app is currently ranked number eight in the finance category of the Apple iTunes App Store (see screenshot below). Of the transactional services, only PayPal and BofA's Mobile Banking are higher.  The application can be used to access online banking at any of the ten financial institution holding companies, and their subsidiaries, currently supported by Firethorn:   1st Bank (Colorado) America First Credit Union Arvest BancorpSouth Caroline First Mercantile Bank Suntrust Synovus USAA Wachovia (now owned by Wells Fargo) The Firethorn application has 27 reviews so far and has scored a 4-star average (out of 5), much better than the typical finance app (see previous coverage here). The main complaint is lack of coverage for the user's bank, which is not the fault of the app.&amp;nbsp; In comparison, Bank of America's app 434 reviews and a 2.5-star rating.  I downloaded the application today and unfortunately I don't have an account at any of the financial institutions. However, that will change next week if they hit the dates contained in the Featured Providers page.  Here are coming soon financial institutions:   Citi Cards (Citibank) "coming Nov. 1" (previous press release here) Chase Bank "coming soon" Regions Bank "beginning this fall"
