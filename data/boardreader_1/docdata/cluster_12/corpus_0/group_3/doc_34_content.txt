As the &amp;#8220;media shitstorm&amp;#8221; - as Cheryl Gledhill calls it - continues, her company has decided to take down the original blog post that kicked off much of the controversy about the NAB UBank social media experiment. The following article by Kathryn Small from iTnews summarises the issues: _______________________________ NAB accused of dishonesty by social media commentators NAB&amp;#8217;s latest social media experiment has been slammed by commentators and customers as &amp;#8216;dishonest and not-very clever&amp;#8217; behaviour. The bank is accused of using anonymous accounts to criticise readers of its new website, UBank, and to post comments on a commentator&amp;#8217;s blog. UBank launched last week with a website for customers to provide feedback about banking in Australia. The website reads in part: &amp;#8220;We need your help. Please share with us and our visitors what frustrates you about your bank, and more importantly, what you would do differently to improve your banking experience. &amp;#8220;Regardless of the issue: rates, fees &amp;amp; charges, customer service, transparency &amp;amp; integrity or touch points (e.g. ATMs, branches, phone or internet banking), we want to hear from you!&amp;#8221; Users initially made comments like &amp;#8216;plenty of ATM&amp;#8217;s, and good customer service would be good&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;I hate it that banks don&amp;#8217;t pass on the full interest rate cuts&amp;#8217;. UBank&amp;#8217;s head of online services, Monty Hamilton, wrote in reply: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s great to see some positive contributions - of course we can all post negative content, and that would be funny for a bit, but let&amp;#8217;s keep it positive.&amp;#8221; One reader responded: &amp;#8220;The instructions to the left say &amp;#8216;Please share with us and our visitors what frustrates you about your bank&amp;#8217; - so I don&amp;#8217;t know why you are suddenly turning around and saying &amp;#8216;let&amp;#8217;s keep it positive.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; This was met by an anonymous commentator, who accused the reader of being &amp;#8220;an agitated [sic] employee from a competitor bank&amp;#8221;. Social media commentator Cheryl Gledhill said in a blog post that the anonymous comment, and some others, appeared to be written by an incognito UBank staff member. - Read the rest of this article at NAB accused of dishonesty by social media commentators - Business - iTnews Australia Posted in Blogging, Online Marketing, Online Tools, Social Media&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Tagged: Cheryl Gledhill, finance, financial markets, NAB, National Australia Bank, Social Media, UBank&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
