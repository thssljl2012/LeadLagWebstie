It is mid-October and I have yet to finish even one application for an internship abroad. Deadlines are in mid-November through late December. But I think the application itself is not bad, but the knowledge of rejection is just daunting....perhaps I'm just scared and I lose confidence each step of the way throughout the applications. Even the questions seem so challenging...thus I'm posting here when I should be instead thinking, for the past 3 hours on the 3 relatively easy and short answer questions that Barclays poses: What makes you suited for the role to which you applied?From the research you have done on our industry, how does our firm fit in with your career aspirations?Describe a recent development in the industry. What implications might this development have for our firm or the division to which you have applied? At this pace, I won't get any applications in on time...yet I&amp;nbsp;really want to apply. This process is just brutal, especially coupled with the market right now:/. Self-Confidence is of most importance and yet, it is something I'm sorely lacking...hopefully by the next time I post....those questions will be answered and the application will be turned in.&amp;nbsp;
