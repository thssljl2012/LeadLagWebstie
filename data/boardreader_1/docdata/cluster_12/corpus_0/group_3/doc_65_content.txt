A group of Filipino workers is backing the Finsec union in its opposition to staff reductions at the ANZ bank.  Migrante Aotearoa, an Auckland based migrant Filipino worker organisation says ANZs treatment of its loyal workforce is deplorable but totally in line with its behaviour in the global arena.  Mr Maga says the bank is a large shareholder in the Oceana Didipio gold  copper mining project in the Phillipines which has caused widespread community displacement, human rights violations, economic dislocation, environmental devastation and social disputes in the national minority communities in Kasibu, Nueva Vizcaya.  In New Zealand ANZ is preparing to throw hundreds of employees out of work. In the Phillipines the very same bank has investments in large scale mining that threatens poor peasants and indigenous peoples with eviction from their ancestral lands.
