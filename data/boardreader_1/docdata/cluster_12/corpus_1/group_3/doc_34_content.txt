A long-serving director of troubled JJB Sports has quit as Wigan head office confirmed the possible sale of some of its newest assets.Group property director Barry Dunn played a major part in the company for the best part of two decades.But shares in the Martland Mill retail giant surged after it said banks remained supportive of the firm, which has faced financial difficulties.In another boardroom shake-up, former Next chief executive David Jones has taken up the new position of deputy chairman, a role which the company says will allow him to focus on retail operations. He first joined the board as a non-executive director 12 months ago.A company statement said that Mr Dunn would 'leave the group with immediate effect to pursue outside property interests' and that a search had begun for a new property director. The 51-year-old joined JJB in 1986 as estates manager and, after three years at Matalan, returned as property director in 1995.The company would not comment today on whether his resignation was related to the announcement that it had been approached about selling its LifeStyle division, which includes Qube and the Original Shoe Company  both of which were only bought in the last few months.Rumours have also been circulating that JJB might also sell its health clubs.A 20% jump in the value of JJB shares was a welcome boost after the company said 'constructive discussions' were under way with lenders Barclays and Halifax Bank of Scotland over its debts, which stood at 57.6m at the end of July.The retailer has loan facilities with the two banks totalling 75m and recently negotiated a 20m bridging loan with now-nationalised Icelandic bank Kaupthing.
