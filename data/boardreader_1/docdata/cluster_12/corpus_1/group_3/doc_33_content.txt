Schools secretary Ed Balls is to launch advice for schools on how they can help prevent violent extremism.He is expected to say that schools can play a 'key role' in helping young people to recognise and reject moves that could draw them into extremism.The Government is expected to officially announce the launch of its 'learning to be safe kit' which shows schools how to raise awareness and address the issues and threats of terrorism.The toolkit should give practical advice to teachers about they can build respect between pupils, encourage feedback and provide support to pupils who may be vulnerable to radicalisation.It follows on from wide-ranging guidance issued by the Government in June for local communities on how to identify and challenge extremists.The guidance said local groups which challenge the messages of violent extremists should be supported.If a group is found to be promoting violent extremism, local agencies and the police should consider disrupting or removing funding, and deny access to public facilities, it suggested.The guidance also contained a 'de-radicalisation' strategy to stop people from getting involved in extremist violence and make young people feel more valued.Of Wednesday's launch, Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said that for the objectives of the guidance to be achieved, trust had to be maintained in schools.She said: 'No teacher will ignore obvious information about a specific, real threat, but it is vital that teachers are able to discuss with and listen to pupils, without feeling that they have to report every word.'Wanderers UpdatesWANDERERS Premier League clashes against Tottenham Hotspur and Everton are set to be moved back 24 hours.ANDY OBrien has revealed he has never been happier after signing a new two-year deal with Wanderers.KEVIN Davies is in the goalscoring form of his life  and hes loving every minute.Do you have a favourite Wanderers goal in the Premiership years?Former Wanderers boss Bruce Rioch will leave Danish champions AaB Aalborg when his contract runs out at the end of the year.Wanderers reserves take on Manchester United in the Barclays Premier Reserve League North on Wednesday night at Leylands County Ground, kick-off 7pm.Tony Kelly gives his expert view
