Gordon Brown urged the immediate release of a European Investment Bank fund Photo: AP At an emergency summit of European leaders in Paris, the prime minister led the charge for immediate access to be made to the fund, which was designed by the EIB last month to be released gradually over the next two years. Brown argued that the crisis in the banks had meant crucial lending lines to small businesses were drying up. A Number 10 spokesperson said: Whats important is for governments to act now to help small and medium businesses cope with the need for credit and thats why were asking for the EIB to bring forward this 15bn. The deal comes as a co-ordinated EU bank bailout package similar to the one in the United States looks increasingly unlikely, according to insiders. Stephen Alambritis, head spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, backed the deal. He said: This is the right message. We told the government last week that banks are starting to ignore small businesses. They must avert a recurrence of the early 1990s, when none of the banks would lend to small companies. Alambritis said companies were already being squeezed by the high-street banks raising overdraft rates. As of October, Barclays has said it is going to charge over 10 points above the base rate - that is a total interest rate of 15 per cent, he said. Tim Weller, an entrepreneur who in 1995 set up the publishing group Incisive Media, said: This is really needed as we are in the midst of a financial crisis. Small companies are the heartbeat of the economy and need to be looked after. Those that have working capital problems would normally go to high street banks, but they cant because there is no liquidity. Charles Ind, of Bowmark Capital, a private equity firm, said: Small businesses are the most vulnerable any help is welcome.
