Against a backdrop of turbulent financial markets, the higher end art and antiques market has continued to perform well, and it is increasingly viewed as one through which to launch alternative investment vehicles.The Dean Art fund, which will launch on 15 October with $50m pledged by initial investors, will be seeking further funds from institutional investors. The minimum investment will be $1m.According to managing director Grard Moxon, individuals will be able to access the fund only through institutional investors such as pensions funds and funds of hedge funds.Moxon has 20 years of experience in the financial markets with Lloyds Bank International and Merrill Lynch.The Dean Art fund will invest in a broad range of art categories, with an emphasis on old masters, impressionism, post-impressionism and modern art, particularly art up to 1980 hence they have stated it would be the likes of Hockney not Hirst, despite the latter's recent 70.5m Sotheby's auction results.Investments in individual works of art are expected to be in the range of 500,000 to 3m.Investments are likely to be sourced predominantly from owners and collectors in the UK, Europe and globally. The artworks will be stored in freeports or other secure holding facilities as appropriate, if they are not on loan to museums or other displaying institutions.The fund will aim for superior investment returns by assembling a diversified portfolio of works and by exploiting multiple channels for the purchase and sale of art.The instruments normally used by hedge funds to hedge risks are not available to the art market. So, the fund will diversify risk within different sectors, countries and types of art, according to Moxon. His definition of art includes all types of works from antiques to sculptures.Investment consultant for the fund will be Jeremy Eckstein, formerly of Sothebys and previously art advisor to the British Rail Pension Fund and to ABN AMRO on fine art funds. David Thomas, former international banking director of Lloyds TSB Bank, will be chairman.The art market is performing strongly, in marked contrast to the worlds stock markets, notes Eckstein. New sources of demand for good quality art are facing an intrinsically fixed supply and are providing strong support for prices. The correlation between equity markets and art prices has rarely been weaker.Steve Williams, Harbours CEO, said: 'Art as an asset class offers investors non-correlation to traditional funds, although the management team intends to use our services to operate the fund as an institutional grade investment fund, with the infrastructure and regulatory framework adequate to the requirements of modern investors,Dean Art will be an open-ended, Jersey-based incorporated cell company, a structure that enables individual investors to choose to be part of the general fund or to have their own distinct cell portfolios.The fund will also accept artworks as investment on an agreed valuation basis (in specie investment). Individual artworks owned by the fund can be leased to shareholders, institutions, corporations and individuals through a separate leasing company.Harbour Capital Partners is a full-service hedge fund investment management platform based in London providing an operational infrastructure for a small or medium-sized funds.In addition to those focusing on art, funds tracking the markets for vintage wine, rare violins and even guitars have cropped up recently as individual investors look for assets able to hold their value in the current environment. Institutional investors are seeking alternatives in line with liability driven investment objectives, as well  as matching assets and liabilities for regulatory purposes over the extreme long-term - a particular issue for pension funds.Wine returns illustratedAgainst global commodity and energy indices the performance of top clarets over the past year has been strong, according to data on the Guernsey-domiciled Vinum Fine Wine Bordeaux fund.Scarborough, UK-based asset manager OWC reports the value of shares in its Vintage Wine Fund, fell 0.77% through August 2008.
