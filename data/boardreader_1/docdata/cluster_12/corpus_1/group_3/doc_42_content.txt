The three-storey building  formerly occupied by Burger King  covers more than 10,000 square feet adjacent to the world famous Piccadilly lights. Work will begin straight away to develop the building into a branch containing the latest designs and technologies, scheduled to open at the end of this year. Erin Biertzer, Distribution Services Director for Barclays, said: We are full of pride to be moving into a site as significant as Piccadilly  one of the most iconic locations in the world  and we will do it proud with a branch worthy of the setting. Branches are important to us and to the millions of our customers who use them each week. For that reason we are investing to make them more accessible and comfortable and, crucially, making it simpler for customers to do their banking with us in a way that suits them. Barclays at Piccadilly is going to really break the mould and it is very exciting.
