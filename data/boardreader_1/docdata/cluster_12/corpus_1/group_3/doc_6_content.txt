STRUGGLING sports retailer JJB Sports has insisted that banks still remain 'supportive' of the firm. The company, which has 400 stores, including five in Edinburgh, said 'constructive discussions' are under way with lenders Barclays and HBoS over its debts, which stood at 57.6 million at the end of July.The retailer has loan facilities with the two banks totalling 75m and recently negotiated a 20m bridging loan with now-nationalised Icelandic bank Kaupthing.However, last month JJB posted half-year losses of 9.7m and its auditors said there was 'significant doubt' about its ability to continue as a going concern. The firm said: 'JJB has experienced some withdrawal of credit insurance cover but remains confident of its trading relationship with its key suppliers who have been keen to support the company.'
