Highlights Against the backdrop of a tough macroeconomic environment, intense competitive pressures and slowing growth in the mature markets of the EU, for years rapidly developing CEE has offered significant opportunities for the powerhouses of European retailing. Even in 2008 growth potential remains huge, attracting retailers and developers to the region.

The situation is exacerbated by high inflationary pressures meaning that purchasing power in CEE is now under acute threat.
