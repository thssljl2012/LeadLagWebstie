NETHERLANDS - The entrance of APG Group and PGGM into the asset management industry has resulted in dramatic shifts in market shares, Bureau Bosch has revealed. Barclays Global Investors, which held top spot in terms of assets under management for over 10 years, was pushed to fourth place behind APG Group, PGGM and Mn Services, according to the Q1 2008 survey.APG Group held 231.1bn, PGGM 88.2bn, Mn Services 62.2bn and BGI 58.9bn.As part of its survey Bureau Bosch looked at more than 80 investment managers who managed the assets of Dutch pension funds.It found large growth in the percentage of externally managed Dutch institutional assets, and said fiduciary and multi-management had been a big winner in that.It said externally managed funds amounted to 265.6bn, which implied a 27.5% stake in the industrys total assets.The report said: If in-house management of fiduciary managers is included, fiduciary management would be 515bn of Dutch pension funds assets.This relatively large market share of fiduciary management is explained by both the popularity of this type of management and because all assets ABP and PFZW (formerly PGGM) are counted as fiduciary assets.Of the asset managers, Dutch firms were among the largest players in this field. The research showed Dutch asset managers had increased their market share to 64%, compared to 45% in Q1 2006. In addition, six of the largest ten managers were of Dutch origin.In Q1 2008, the top 10 largest managers were managing assets worth 660.5bn (2007: 380 bn) or 71% of the total externally managed Dutch pension plan assets. Of these 10 asset managers, nine offered fiduciary and/or multi manager solutions and/or overlay programmes. Of the assets managed, 212bn was managed indirectly. Compensating for double counting, the top-10 largest managers managed 449bn directly, or 63% of Dutch pension fund assets. The other asset managers (over 70), therefore managed the remaining 271bn (2006: 238 bn), including fiduciary management, multi-management and overlays. The report said: The 9.5% increase in the stake of the 10 largest managers shows that the concentration of assets has become even more pronounced.
