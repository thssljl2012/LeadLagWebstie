(Xinhua via COMTEX News Network) -- Kenya's newest brewery, Keroche Industries, launched its operations on Friday to challenge the might of East African Breweries (EABL), whose beers and spirits dominate the country's lively bars. Kenyan-owned Keroche hopes to tap a spring of consumer loyalty among a growing middle class in east Africa's largest economy. Keroche Industries has invested one billion shillings (about 12. 5 million U.S. dollars), funded by a loan from Barclays Bank, in its beer plant in Naivasha in the Great Rift Valley. It employs 200 professionals of various skills, 3,000 other Kenyans and has a 40,000 bottle-per-day capacity compared with EABL's 176,000 bottle-per-hour capacity at its Nairobi plant. Speaking during the launch of the brewery, located in Naivasha, about 90 kilometres northwest of Nairobi, Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga lauded the Keroche Industries for investing 1 billion shillings in a new plant and said the trend was certain to catalyse new foreign investment in the country.
