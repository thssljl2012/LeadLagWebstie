The crash in share prices, so severe at HBOS that it is now worth less than 10pc of its peak value three years ago, has pushed the market value of UK banks below their defined benefit pension liabilities.Charles Cowling, managing director at Pension Capital Strategies (PCS), said the scale of the banks liabilities when compared to their equity value made both the schemes and the banks increasingly vulnerable. 'The defined benefit pension liabilities of HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland are now significantly greater than each bank's equity market value,' Mr Cowling said. 'Equity investments held by the pension schemes of these three banks may also outstrip the banks' own equity market values making the banks even more vulnerable to falls in the stock market.' RBS is the most exposed. Its 27.3bn of pension liabilities is almost three times larger than its 11bn market value. Lloyds has a pension liability of 16.8bn against a 9bn market capitalisation and HBOS has 7.6bn of liabilities compared with its 4.6bn equity value. In the case of Lloyds and HBOS, the pension schemes are also in deficit by 683m at Lloyds and 294m at HBOS. However, the real picture could be far worse. Broker Morgan Stanley added that corporate profits in 2009 could be hit as businesses top up pension fund contributions.A large pension scheme is not an obstacle to a company's success but can leave it exposed if the liabilities suddenly increase due to changes in longevity or the performance of the fund. Mr Cowling said: 'A 10pc increase in liabilities at RBS, for example, is suddenly a quarter of shareholder funds so it is much more vulnerable.' Topping up such a large pension scheme could drain resources and have an adverse impact on credit ratings, he added. Barclays, worth 18bn, just covers its 17.5bn of liabilities. HSBC and Standard Chartered have proportionately small pension schemes.
