A NEW skateboarding park will be officially opened in Moray this weekend  12 years after the idea was first raised.Various action groups have formed and disbanded at Buckie over the years, but it was not until six years ago that a group of committed residents began to shape the plan into reality.Christopher Bremner, 26, of Well Road, joined the Buckie Skatepark Group two years ago, and became its chairman in July.Mr Bremner, who has a history of BMX biking, works as an architectural technician for Springfield Properties at Elgin. He was able to oversee the project through to completion, and provide advice to contractors.The park was due to be completed earlier in the year, but was delayed because of problems with materials. At one point the committee thought they would have to cut back on certain features. Mr Bremner said: Part of our concern was that the price of concrete and steel was going through the roof. The contractor came up with the idea of making polystyrene shapes of the ramps that we could just pour the concrete over. It was a great idea and saved us a lot of money. The 150,000 park will be officially unveiled on Saturday by Moray MP Angus Robertson, although it has already proved popular in the town since it was finished a week ago. The Buckie Skatepark Group raised 13,500 through coffee mornings, quizzes, and donations of 6,000.They were helped by grants from sportscotland (30,000), HIE Moray (25,000), and around 40,000 from Moray Council.An additional 7,000 came from the Buckie Common Good Fund, and the Lloyds TSB Foundation donated a further 5,000.The facility, on the site of the former tennis court at Ian Johnston Park, includes quarter and half-pipe ramps.The Buckie Skatepark Group has attracted 150 members so far and Mr Bremner believes numbers will grow over the coming months. He said: It has taken many years and a huge amount of hard work from everyone involved, but the end result is a facility that Buckie can be proud of.
