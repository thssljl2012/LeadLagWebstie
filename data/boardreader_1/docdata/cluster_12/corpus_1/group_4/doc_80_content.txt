ABC Learning Centres Ltd., seized by lenders after the credit crisis forced up interest payments, owes Australia's four biggest banks A$762 million ($507 million). Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation's largest mortgage provider, said today it loaned ABC A$240 million, joining National Australia Bank Ltd., Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and Westpac Banking Corp. in disclosing the amount of credits extended to the struggling company. ABC Learning, which looks after one in three Australian children in daycare at almost 1,100 centers, joins Allco Finance Group as the nation's second publicly traded company to appoint outside managers this week. The government today pledged as much as A$22 million to keep the business running until the end of the year, saying about 40 percent of the centers are unprofitable.  Copyright : Euclid Infotech Pvt.
