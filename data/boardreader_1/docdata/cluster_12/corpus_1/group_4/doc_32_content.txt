Paul Fegan, chief executive and managing director of St. George Bank, has announced his resignation.  'Given that St.George shareholders have overwhelmingly endorsed the [Westpac/St.George] merger, it's now appropriate to make my decision about the future,' said Fegan.  Fegan, who will receive a $2 million payout as a result of his resignation, said he is 'very proud' to leave the bank in a very good position and is pleased about last week's announcement that St.George and Westpac were going ahead with their merger.  Fegan joined St.George in July 2002 and has been the Bank's chief executive since November 2007 and managing director since February 2008.  The chairman of St.George, John Curtis, thanked Fegan for his contribution to the bank, including his assistance during the merger process.  Gail Kelly, chief executive and managing Westpac, said: 'I would particularly like to thank him for his strong leadership of St.George over this challenging 2008 year and for his assistance in ensuring the merger gets off to a good start.'  In addition to the $2 million, Fegan will also receive payment for any amounts in respect of accrued salary, leave and other entitlements.  Fegan's contract will terminate on 8 December 2008 and he will take annual leave from 28 November 2008.
