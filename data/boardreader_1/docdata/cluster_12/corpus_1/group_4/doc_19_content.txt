St George Bank Ltd shareholders have voted overwhelmingly in favour of Westpac Banking Corp's $16 billion merger proposal.  St George chairman John Curtis said after the bank's extraordinary general meeting on Thursday, to vote on the merger, that there had been a strong vote in favour of the cash and scrip deal.'Over 94 per cent was a very strong endorsement, ' Mr Curtis told journalists.'I think the benefits of this deal were obviously very clear to our shareholders.  A count of proxy votes cast by St George shareholders had 278.76 million shares, or 94.37 per cent, cast in favour of the merger, with 14.63 million, or 4.95 per cent, cast against.  A total of 293.39 million shares were voted in the merger poll, which is equivalent to just over half of St George's total number of shares on issue.  The final result is expected to be released to the Australian stock exchange shortly.'Creating a bigger, stronger bank between two very well run banks, in this climate today makes a lot of sense,' Mr Curtis said.'Secondly, the business model, which Westpac proposed to us - it was all about retaining the St George culture, retaining the brands, the branches, the ATM network - and that was something that we found very compelling,' he said.'And then the premium for St George shareholders - 1.31 Westpac shares was 28.5 per cent above the spot price at the time.'The Finance Sector Union (FSU) has estimated that as many as 5,000 jobs could be at risk due to the merger.  Mr Curtis told journalists that the number was pure speculation although in his presentation earlier to shareholders warned there may be job losses.'Yes, unfortunately there may well be some job losses, mainly in the back office and head office functions, which are inevitable with any merger,' Mr Curtis said.'But Westpac have given a commitment to minimise job losses through natural attrition and redeployment wherever possible.'However, whilst the board understands that there will be some inevitable short-term pain, the acceptance of the Westpac proposal is all about trying to create a stronger and even better bank for customers, staff and shareholders over the ensuing years, particularly having regard to the current uncertain economic outlook.'Westpac is offering 1.31 of its shares for every St George share and a special dividend payment.  Mr Curtis said St George had performed well in its fiscal 2008 year and had 'punched above its weight'.He said that all banks were facing difficult and turbulent financial times.'Despite the recent action taken by the Australian government, our financial services sector is expected to continue facing a number of challenges in the coming year,' Mr Curtis said.'These include softening growth across the broader Australian economy, slower growth in lending products and an increase in credit defaults.'In this environment, the earnings growth for all banks, including St George, is expected to slow.'
