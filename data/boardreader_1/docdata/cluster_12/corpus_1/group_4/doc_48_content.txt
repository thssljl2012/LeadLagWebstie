A SYNDICATE of ABC Learning's banking creditors has lent the failed company a further $30 million to keep child-care centres open until the end of the year.  The money is a direct response to urgent requests from ABC's administrators, who went to the Federal Court on Wednesday to seek approval for a quick injection of cash to continue operating ABC's 1040 child-care centres in the short term.  In a statement, the Commonwealth Bank confirmed the banking syndicate had agreed to a short-term loan, which will be treated as a priority repayment above all other debts to creditors.  However, a spokesman for ABC's receivers, McGrathNicol, yesterday would not comment on the situation of ABC's finances and reiterated the receivers were still calling for enrolments for next year.  The quick injection of funds by the banking syndicate was welcome relief for ABC Learning's administrators Ferrier Hodgson, who told the Federal Court that ABC would be out of money as of yesterday unless an extra debt burden was granted.  In an affidavit presented to the court, it was revealed Commonwealth and Westpac banks injected about $10 million into ABC the day after administrators took over the operations on November 6.  That money has since run out and the banking syndicate has extended its loans by up to $30 million to add to the $22 million pledged by the Federal Government to pay ABC staff to the end of the year.  The banking syndicate also includes the National Australia Bank, ANZ, Citigroup, BankWest, Bank of America and Japan's Mizuho Corporate Bank.  The full extent of creditors' exposure was also revealed in the Federal Court yesterday with Malcolm Oakes, SC, telling the court that ABC had a further 400 creditors excluding the banking syndicate, shareholders and employees. Those creditors, which include tradesmen and service industries, are owed about $110 million.  The banking syndicate is owed a total of $860 million with another $600 million owed to unsecured note holders, taking ABC's total debt to $1.57 billion. Continued...
