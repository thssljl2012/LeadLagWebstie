(The Nation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX News Network) -- A petrol station and a restaurant on Monday became the latest victims of demolitions on Thika Road to make way for expansion of the highway.   Njoka Service Station and Giant Restaurant were adjacent to Nakumatt Thika Road, which was flattened on Saturday.   But the operation was partially halted at midday after one of the four bulldozers developed mechanical problems.   Ministry of Roads personnel were optimistic that work would resume once the problem was fixed.   The three-day demolition has led to loss of property worth millions of shillings.   The Government started flattening buildings on road reserves after their owners defied a three-month notice to pull them down.   Proprietors claim the Government did not give them any notice. They also say they acquired the parcels of land legally.   A spot check by the Nation revealed that some people had already destroyed their buildings before the arrival of Government bulldozers. This was aimed at avoiding incurring huge demolition costs.   The expansion of Thika Road into a super-highway is set to begin early next year.   Some banks have also been affected by the demolition and have been forced to close shop. They include Barclays Bank and Family Bank branches in Githurai 45. Five filling stations are also draining their fuel stock to avert losses.   Roy Transmotors and Roy Hauliers Limited in Roysambu were also pulled down. Other car bazaars and garages face the same fate. They include Volex General Motors, Sagas Auto Garage, Newnet Motors and Katiba Executive Motors.   Motorists have praised the move to expand the highway, which they termed a solution to the perpetual traffic gridlock that is Thika Road.   But Central Organisation of Trade Unions secretary-general Francis Atwoli condemned the move, saying that many had lost their jobs as a result.
