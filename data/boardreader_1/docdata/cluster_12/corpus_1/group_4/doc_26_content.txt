The Daily Mail City team explains, what the government-owned financial institution, the is. Another bank wreck? Hardly. This isn't an investment bank in the Lehman Brothers or BearThe European Investment Bank is a huge government-owned financial institution and is perfectly solid. What's it for? The EIB was set up in the 1950s to help the reconstruction of postwar Europe. Last year it handed out more than 35bn of new loans to member states, and it has over 250bn of loans outstanding. Among last year's projects were new facilities for the University of Bristol, a Docklands Light Railway extension and hospital modernisation in Stoke-on-Trent. How is it funded? The EIB raises its cash on the financial markets. It benefits from very low rates thanks to its EU government backing. The cash is used to provide cheap financing around Europe. It doesn't draw on EU taxpayer cash and tends to make a modest profit on its activities. Why do I care? Because the EIB is making up to 4bn available for UK small and medium-sized enterprises over the next four years. That sounds good, but it is up to UK commercial banks to dole the money out. Previous take-up on an SME scheme was paltry and it remains to be seen how enthusiastic lenders are this time round. Other stories:             Barclays may need to raise another 4bn
