Barclays staff have been helping with this work over many years and one of the benefits is the arrival of bats in areas that are starting to recover. Bats are spreading into more of Brownsea Islands nature reserve, thanks to the work of volunteers, including large numbers of employees from Barclays. The last two weekends have seen hundreds of volunteers from the Poole company clearing and burning huge piles of rhododendron, cut over the last year.
