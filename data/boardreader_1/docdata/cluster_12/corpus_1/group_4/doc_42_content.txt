Car dealer Automotive Holdings Group says it has rearranged its floor plan financing following the announcement two weeks ago by General Motors financing arm, GMAC Australia, that it was withdrawing from the local market.  The GM announcement accompanied a similar move by another major US vehicle financier, GE.  AHG says it has replaced its GMAC floor plan facilities from within its existing network of financiers - St George Bank Automotive Finance, Toyota Finance, Mercedes Benz Finance, Capital Finance and UDC in New Zealand.  The dealer said on Monday it also had concluded negotiations to replace GE prior to that financier's announcement last week that it, too, would withdraw from the Australian and New Zealand markets.  AHG's GE floor plan facilities will be transferred in November to Nissan Finance, a new entrant to the market, the company said.  AHG holds 86 car dealerships in four states and New Zealand across Toyota, Holden, Ford, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Hyundai, Nissan, Subaru, Honda, Citroen, Peugeot &amp;amp; Kia, and truck franchises including Iveco, Mitsubishi Fuso, Hino, and Volkswagen.
