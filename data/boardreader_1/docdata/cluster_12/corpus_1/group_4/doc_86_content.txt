The extraordinary general meeting was the final hurdle for Westpac's acquisition of St. George, Australia's fifth-biggest bank.   John Curtis, chairman of St. George's board, which had recommended that Westpac's cash and shares offer be accepted, said the vote had been strongly in favor of the deal. 'Creating a bigger, stronger bank between two very well run banks in this climate today makes a lot of sense,' Curtis told reporters after the meeting in Sydney.   He said that all banks were facing difficult and turbulent financial times. 'In this environment, the earnings growth for all banks, including St. George, is expected to slow,' Curtis said. Westpac offered 1.31 of its shares for each St. George share plus a special dividend payment.   The government approved the acquisition last month but set conditions that must remain in place for three years.   Westpac is required to maintain the existing number of Westpac and St. George branches and automatic teller machines. Westpac must also retain all of both banks' retail banking brands and maintain dedicated management teams for both banks' retail banking distribution.   St. George shares lost 9.4 percent to close at AU$24 ($15.44) and Westpac dropped 11.2 percent to AU$16.97 ($10.92). Other major banks also lost ground as Australia's key stock index slid almost 6 percent Thursday.
