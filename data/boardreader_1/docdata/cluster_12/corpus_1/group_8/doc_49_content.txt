* UBS makes gain of 305 mln francs on bond buyback  * Repurchase boosts Tier 1 ratio by 0.1 percent (Adds detail, background)  ZURICH, March 26 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSN.VX)(UBS.N) has made a 305 million Swiss franc ($272 million) gain on a bond buyback announced a week ago that has also boosted its capital ratio, the Swiss bank said on Thursday.  UBS said it had bought back bonds for a total of 537 million francs relating to a principal amount of 842 million francs.  It also said the repurchase boosted its Tier 1 capital ratio by 0.1 percent. UBS had a Tier 1 ratio -- a key measure of capital strength -- of 11.5 percent at the end of 2008.  UBS said a week ago it would buy back up to 1 billion euros ($1.36 billion) of four subordinate issues with maturity dates between November 2015 and September 2019 and a notional value of around 7 billion Swiss francs.  The UBS move comes after U.S. bank Morgan Stanley netted a $2.3 billion gain last year after it repurchased $12.1 billion of fixed and floating rate long-term debt.  UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, was one of the banks hit hardest by the subprime crisis, prompting it to raise capital three times in less than 18 months in order to shore up its balance sheet.
