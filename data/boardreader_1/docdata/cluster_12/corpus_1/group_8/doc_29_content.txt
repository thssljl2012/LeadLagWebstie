Global economic conditions have deteriorated rapidly over the last several months as a result of the financial crisis and recession that negatively impacted markets in North America, Europe and Asia during 2008. These developments are having and will likely continue to have a broad-reaching impact on the Company's businesses and the industries in which they operate. The severity, duration and impact of these developments are not yet fully understood. Many of the Company's customers are experiencing financial constraints and have reduced or deferred their purchases. In response to this current environment, the Company has subsequent to the year end announced certain initiatives in both its Silicon and Magnesium Groups, including those noted above and a cost containment plan as separately announced today, to reduce expenditures and accelerate reduction of working capital.  '2008 was a transformational year for Timminco marked by significant progress in the build out of our solar grade silicon product line, which contributed nearly $65 million to revenue,' said Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Timminco. 'Based on our proprietary purification process in the production of UMG Si, Timminco is positioned to capitalize on the long-term opportunity in the solar industry. In the near term, however, the rapid deterioration of global economic and credit conditions and its profound impact on demand for solar energy installations have caused many of our customers to reduce orders. However, with a low-cost purification process for producing solar grade silicon, we remain confident about our prospects as market conditions improve. Moreover, through our relationship with AMG, we are exploring opportunities to leverage our position as a leading supplier of UMG Si to further improve the value proposition of our product.'  Financial Results  Timminco has two reporting segments: the Silicon Group, which includes the silicon metal and solar grade silicon product lines, and the Magnesium Group, which includes the magnesium extrusion, fabrication and specialty metals product lines.  Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $72.7 million, an increase of 100% from $36.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Consolidated sales for the 2008 year were $252.6 million, an increase of 52% from $166.2 million for 2007. The increases were primarily attributable to higher sales for the Company's Silicon Group, specifically its solar grade silicon and silicon metal products.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased to $6.4 million from an EBITDA loss of $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. EBITDA for the 2008 year increased to $21.3 million from an EBITDA loss of $8.9 million for 2007.  Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $1.3 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $8.8 million, or $0.08 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2007. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 included updated charges for provisions related to reorganization, environmental remediationand capital asset impairments Excluding these items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $1.9 million. Net loss for the 2008 year was $22.6 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to a net loss of $18.0 million, or $0.20 per share for 2007. The increase in the net loss for the 2008 year was primarily the result of charges relating to the closure of the Magnesium Group's Haley, Ontario manufacturing facility and an asset impairment charge relating to the Company's investment in Fundo Wheels. Excluding the Haley costs, impairment charges, and the equity in the loss of Fundo Wheels, adjusted net income for the 2008 year was $10.4 million.  During the fourth quarter of 2008, Timminco invested approximately $20.0 million to support the expansion of its solar grade silicon production facility to 14,400 metric tons of nominal annual production capacity. Total investment in the Company's solar grade silicon production facility for the 2008 year was approximately $67.0 million.  Cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2008 were $4.6 million compared to $34.6 million at December 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company received deposits of $4.4 million from customers under solar grade silicon supply contracts. At December 31, 2008, the Company had funds available to it through its revolving credit facility of US$6.2 million. Subsequent to the year-end, Timminco completed an equity offering of 7.04 million common shares at a price of $3.55 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $25.0 million. The Company believes it will have sufficient liquidity to finance its working capital needs, based on its revolving credit facility, expected cash flow from operations and cash on hand.  Silicon Group  Sales for the Silicon Group for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $58.5 million, an increase of 140% from $24.3 million for 2007, and accounted for 80% of Timminco's total sales. Sales for the 2008 year were $189.5 million, an increase of 83% from $103.7 million for 2007 and accounted for 75% of Timminco's total sales. The increases were due to higher sales volumes for each of the solar grade silicon and silicon metal product lines, as well as higher average selling prices for silicon metal. The weakness of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar and the Euro had a favourable impact on sales of $6.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $8.8 million for the 2008 year.  The Silicon Group shipped 424 metric tons of solar grade silicon in the fourth quarter, an increase of 41% from 300 metric tons shipped in the third quarter of 2008, generating revenue of $27.7 million. For the 2008 year, the Silicon Group shipped 1,045 metric tons of solar grade silicon, generating revenue of $64.6 million.  Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased to $15.4 million, or 26.3% of sales, from negative $2.7 million, or negative 11.1% of sales, for the fourth quarter of 2007. Gross profit for the 2008 year increased to $40.1 million, or 21.2% of sales, from $0.9 million, or 0.9% of sales, for 2007. Total solar grade silicon product cost of sales for the fourth quarter 2008 and fiscal 2008 were $12.6 million and $33.0 million respectively. The increases in gross profit were primarily the result of higher sales volumes of solar grade silicon.  EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased to $11.6 million from an EBITDA loss of $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. EBITDA for the 2008 year increased to $31.9 million from an EBITDA loss of $0.7 million for 2007. The increases are the result of the change in the sales mix to a higher proportion of solar grade silicon, the favourable impact of translation of U.S. dollar and Euro denominated sales to Canadian dollars and higher margins on solar grade silicon.  Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased to $7.5 million from a net loss of $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and net income for the 2008 year increased to $19.9 million from a net loss of $1.6 million for 2007.  Magnesium Group  Sales for the Magnesium Group for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $14.2 million, an increase of 17% from $12.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase is attributable to price increases across most product lines in response to higher magnesium metal costs, which were partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the weak US economy.
