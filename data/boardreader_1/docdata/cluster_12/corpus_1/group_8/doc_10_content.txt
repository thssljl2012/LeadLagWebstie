The National Australia Bank (NAB) has announced a 25% cut to its dividend.  NAB, which is Australia's largest lender, is the second Australian bank to announce a dividend cut after ANZ decreased its payout in February.  The bank also placed a trading halt on its securities on Thursday morning but lifted it a short time later.  There has been speculation that the NAB, which owns the Bank of New Zealand, is poised to cut hundreds of jobs in New Zealand, Australia and Britain.  The NAB scrip has reportedly been under pressure from investors over the group's exposure to the ailing British banking market.  However, in a strategy update document on Thursday, the bank confirmed it would not be looking to sell its Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks in Britain.  The bank acknowledged that it was operating in an 'increasingly challenging' economic climate but said it remained committed to both its domestic market and British businesses.  NAB also announced that it has appointed group chief financial officer Mark Joiner as a new executive director.
