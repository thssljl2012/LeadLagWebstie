'ITEX has been fortunate to be resilient to the fallout from the global financial crisis,' said Steven White, Chairman and CEO. 'The current economic turmoil has resulted in an increase in media coverage of the benefits offered to businesses with the use of barter through the ITEX platform. New member registration increased 45% this quarter and 31% for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 when compared to the same periods last year. To capitalize on these difficult economic times, we made a conscious decision at the beginning of this fiscal year to invest more in our technology, support staff, and sales, marketing and advertising efforts in order to build market share and increase future profits.'  'We saw a small increase in revenues for the quarter,' Mr. White continued. 'Expenses and earnings were in line with what we expected. Selling, general and administrative costs increased this quarter primarily due to an increase in bad debt expenses related to increases in revenue and accounts receivable. Other contributing factors were increases in rents due to our August 2008 acquisition, investor relations expense and expenses related to our web services initiative. We have virtually no long term debt on our balance sheet and our short term acquisition debt has been reduced to $301,000. Three of our four acquisitions since August 2005 have been paid in full. All four acquisitions are now fully integrated into our operations and are contributing positively to our long-term strategies.'  'For the remainder of this fiscal year, we plan to continue to invest our cash flow and earnings in our future; to be aggressive in utilizing ITEX Marketplace resources. While other businesses slow spending, we seek to capture market share and capitalize on opportunities that arise in difficult economic conditions.'  Second Quarter 2009 Highlights  -- Revenue of $4,365,000 compared to $4,175,000 in the same period last year; -- Income from operations of $235,000 compared to $482,000 in the same period last year, reflecting the increase in selling, general and administrative costs in the quarter; -- Net cash provided from operations of $1,187,000 compared to $1,805,000 in the same six-month period last year; -- Cash at end of period was $1,207,000 compared to $1,061,000 at July 31, 2008; -- Registered 1,108 new members in the current quarter verses 765 last year and registered 2,052 for the six-month period versus 1,571 last year, a 45% and 31% increase respectively; -- Paid off the remaining balance of our note to The Intagio Group, Inc. for the recently acquired media services assets; -- Entered into an agreement with U.S. Bank to increase the maximum loan amount under our revolving credit facility from $1.0 million to $1.5 million and lower the interest rate.
