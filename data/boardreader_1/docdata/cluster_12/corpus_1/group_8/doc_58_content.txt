The directors announce the statement of results for the year ended 31 December 2008 as follows:-  ABOUT THE COMPANY  Japanese Accelerated Performance Fund Limited is a Guernsey incorporated, closed-ended investment company. With the exception of two Management Shares issued for administrative reasons, the Company's issued share capital comprises 30,000,000 Participating Shares ('Shares') whose performance is designed to depend upon the performance of the Nikkei 225 Index. The Company has an unlimited life but the Shares will be redeemed on or around 22 December 2009 (the 'Redemption Date').  Investment Objective and Policy  The investment objective of the Company is to provide shareholders, on the Redemption Date, with five times the capital return of the Nikkei 225 Index, up to a maximum amount (the 'Final Capital Entitlement') of 200p per Share, comprising a capital growth amount of up to a maximum of 100p per Share and a capital amount of 100p per Share. The Final Capital Entitlement per Share is designed to be determined by the performance of the Nikkei 225 Index over the calculation period from 17 December 2003 to 17 December 2009.  The Shares are Sterling denominated and their value will not be affected by changes in the Yen / Sterling exchange rate.  In accordance with the Company's investment policy, the net proceeds derived from the issue of Shares have been invested in a portfolio of debt securities and over-the-counter derivative instruments at prices based on the closing level of the Nikkei 225 Index on 17 December 2003 of 10,092.64. Therefore, if the Nikkei 225 Index rises 20% from its starting level of 10,092.64 on 17 December 2003, which equates to a level of 12,111.17 in December 2009, the Shares are designed to return a capital growth of 100%.  There is full capital protection if the Nikkei 225 Index has fallen at the end of the calculation period (December 2009) unless the Nikkei 225 Index has closed more than 50% down during the calculation period at 5046.32 or lower. In this case, if the Nikkei 225 Index is still below 10,092.64 at the end of the calculation period, the net asset value of the Company will fall by an equivalent percentage. If the level of the Nikkei 225 Index has returned above its starting level of 10,092.64 at the close of business on 17 December 2009, then the Company will still provide five times the return of the Nikkei 225 Index to a maximum of 100% of capital introduced.  The Company has invested substantially all of its net assets in medium term loan notes ('Debt Securities') issued by financial institutions, selected by the Manager, that, at the date of issue of the relevant Debt Security, had a rating of at least A- or A3, as determined by Standard &amp; Poor's and/or Moody's Investor Services Inc. respectively and was either (a) a credit institution as defined in Article 1 of the Council Directive of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (No 2000/12/EC), other than an institution referred to in Article 2(3) of that Directive, if authorised by the competent authority of an EU Member State in relation to the credit institution concerned; (b) a bank authorised in a Member State of the European Economic Area; or (c) a bank authorised by a signatory state (other than an EU Member State or a Member State of the European Economic Area) to the Basle Capital Convergence Agreement of July 1988 (Switzerland, Canada, Japan and the US).  To avoid over-dependency on any single issuer, the Company has acquired seven Debt Securities. It is not anticipated that this portfolio of Debt Securities will be varied prior to the maturity date of the Debt Securities other than in exceptional circumstances.  Your attention is drawn to the Schedule of Investments, which shows the assets held by the Company, and note 12 (b) to the financial statements, which refers to the credit risk of the issuers of these assets as at the end of the reporting period and as at the date of this announcement.  In the event of a default by an issuer of a Debt Security purchased by the Company, the Company would rank as an unsecured creditor in respect of sums due from the issuer of such Debt Security. In such event, the Company may (in respect of that Debt Security) receive a lesser amount (if any) and at a different time than the proceeds anticipated at the maturity of the relevant Debt Security. Any losses would be borne by the Company and returns to Shareholders would be significantly adversely affected.  The Company has also sold a put option to BNP Paribas with an effective date of 17 December 2009, the proceeds of which sale were used to finance the acquisition of the Debt Securities. The performance of the put option is linked to the performance of the Nikkei 225 Index (the 'Index'). At an Index value of 10,092.64 or above at the close of business on 17 December 2009, or if the Index has never closed below 5,046.32 during the calculation period from 17 December 2003 to 17 December 2009, the put option will be worth Nil at maturity. If the Index has closed below 5,046.32 over the calculation period and the Index is still below 10,092.64 on 17 December 2009, the put option will be worth a percentage of the notional value, being 30,000,000, equivalent to the percentage fall in the level of the Nikkei 225 Index over the calculation period, such payment payable to BNP Paribas by the Company.  The Company has not invested and will not invest in other listed investment companies (included listed investment trusts).  The Company may borrow up to ten percent of its net asset value for temporary purposes. It is not, however, the current intention of the Directors to engage in any borrowing. Without prejudice to the powers of the Company to invest in transferable securities, the Company may not lend to, nor act as guarantor on behalf of, third parties.  CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008  At launch the net proceeds derived from the issue of Shares of the Company were invested in a portfolio of debt securities and options at a price based on the level of the Nikkei 225 Index at the close of business on 17 December 2003, namely 10,092.64. On 31 December 2008, the Nikkei 225 Index closed at 8,859.56, a fall of 12.2% since launch and 42.1% over the reporting period. Over the same periods, the total market value of the Company's shares fell by 10.0% and 45.2% respectively.  As the Company's investment portfolio is based upon the Nikkei 225 Index, it is possible to show the potential capital entitlements available to shareholders based on the level of the Nikkei 225 Index on 17 December 2009, being the last date of the calculation period. These figures are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent forecasts or take into account any unforeseen circumstances.  As at 17 December 2009:  Final Nikkei 225 Index  Net Asset Value if  Net Asset Value if  Nikkei 225 Index never  Nikkei 225 Index has  closes below 5,046.32**  closed below  13,000 and over  * Nikkei 225 Index level at the end of the reporting year  ** On any day from 17 December 2003 to 17 December 2009  Since the financial year end the Nikkei 225 Index has fallen further as the pace of the global economic decline appeared to quicken. Consensus forecasts are currently predicting the global recession will not end until at least late 2009 threatening more pain for Japan's export dependent economy. Whilst further falls in the Index are quite possible, any signs of economic recovery could prompt a considerable rally, at least over the short term.  On 9 March 2009, the Index closed at 7086.03, down 20.0% from the end of December 2008 in local currency terms and down 24.2% in Sterling terms. The substantial fall in the Index has, as may be expected, resulted in some weakness in the Company's shares, in part due to concerns the full capital protection could be lost if the Index closes below 5046.32 (a fall of 28.8% from current levels) on any day during the calculation period. Since the financial year end, the shares have, however, outperformed the underlying Index, falling by 15.6% to 76 pence on 9 March 2009. Moreover, if the Nikkei 225 Index were to close at its current level on the Company's end date of 17 December 2009, not having closed below 5046.32 on any business day during the calculation period, the final capital entitlement would be 100 pence.
