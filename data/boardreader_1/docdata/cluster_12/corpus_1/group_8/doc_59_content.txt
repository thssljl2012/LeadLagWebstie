'Rio Tinto announces that Jan du Plessis will be appointed as chairman of the boards with effect from the conclusion of the annual general meeting of Rio Tinto on 20 April, 2009,' the group said in a statement on Tuesday.  Du Plessis, who will continue in his current role as BAT chairman, will replace outgoing Rio Tinto boss Paul Skinner. 'I am delighted to have the opportunity to lead the Rio Tinto Boards at a time of significant change and to be working with such a strong management team,' said du Plessis, who has worked for BAT since 2004.  The world's third biggest miner had been searching for a new chairman since Jim Leng quit in February, less than a month after being appointed to the board.  Rio Tinto said at the time Skinner, who announced his retirement in October amid the throes of a hostile takeover bid from rival BHP Billiton Ltd, would remain in the role until mid-2009 as the company searched for a replacement.
