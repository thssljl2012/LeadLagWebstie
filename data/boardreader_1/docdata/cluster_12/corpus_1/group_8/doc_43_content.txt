NAB chief executive Cameron Clyne says the bank is not working to any job reduction targets.  Mr Clyne said there had been some job losses in its MLC wealth management unit at the start of 2008/09. 'But none of our businesses are working to job reduction targets,' he said. The planned restructure of nabCapital, NAB's institutional banking arm, would also not result in mass job losses. 'We are not anticipating significant reductions,' he said, adding that there may be some efficiencies taken if there is duplication in jobs.  NAB plans to add another 150 to 200 business bankers in 2009, he said.
