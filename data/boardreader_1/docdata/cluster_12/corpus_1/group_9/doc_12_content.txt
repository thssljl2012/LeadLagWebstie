Private health insurer NIB Holdings Ltd has formed a strategic alliance with the National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) under which NIB will offer health insurance to NAB customers.  NIB managing director Mark Fitzgibbon said the alliance provided an opportunity to grow NIB's customer base nationally and to take a formative step into the financial services sector.'We've made no secret of the fact that we're very interested in developing growth and diversification opportunities, particularly in the financial sector,' Mr Fitzgibbon said on Wednesday.  He said NIB was hoping to increase its policyholder base by at least 5,000 policies in the first 15 months of the alliance.  NAB customers will be able to join NIB's Value Health Insurance when the product is launched later this month.  NIB said it had not provided guidance on policyholder growth for the 2010 full year.'Any future guidance provided by NIB will include the acquisition of customers through the NAB alliance,' NIB said.NIB's current guidance for fiscal 2009 is for policyholder growth of about four per cent and net underwriting margin of around four per cent reflecting the forecast acquisition of customers through the NAB partnership.  NIB shares were six cents higher at 87 cents at 1226 AEDT on Thursday.
