Insituform Technologies entered into a new $115 million credit facility with a syndicate of banks, with Bank of America serving as the administrative agent.   The credit facility consists of a $65 million three-year revolving credit line and a $50 million three-year term loan facility. The new facility replaces the company's existing $35 million facility, which was scheduled to expire in April 2009.   Insituform also announced that it concluded the acquisition of North America based Corrpro Companies, a provider of corrosion protection and pipeline maintenance services, in a transaction valued at approximately $92 million. The entire amount of the term loan was drawn by the company to pay a portion of the cash purchase price of the acquisition, which closed on March 31.
