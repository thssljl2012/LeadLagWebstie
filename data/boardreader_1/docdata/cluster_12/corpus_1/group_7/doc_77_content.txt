 WESTPAC says its first quarter profit fell 2 per cent, amid challenging market conditions.  The bank said its pro-forma unaudited cash earnings for the three months ended December 31 was about $1.2 billion, down 2 per cent on the prior corresponding period. The result includes St George Bank, which it took over last year. 'Our underlying performance remains solid as we continue to support our customers in what is clearly a deteriorating economic environment,' chief executive Gail Kelly said.  Total lending in the quarter rose 2.4 per cent, over the prior quarter, with particularly good growth in mortgage and business lending in Australia, the bank said.  Lending growth in Westpac's institutional and New Zealand businesses was slower.  Customer deposits grew strongly over the prior quarter, up 9.6 per cent. 'Group revenue was up strongly, particularly in net interest income with improved margins,' the bank said. 'Non-interest income growth was also healthy, although wealth revenues were weaker.' Expenses were running at a marginally lower rate than the full 2008 year growth rate.  Westpac also said impairment charges rose to $800 million for in the December quarter, from $144 million in the prior corresponding period.  The December quarter impairment experience was impacted by a $360 million increase in provisions for three large corporate exposures.
