Marylebone Warwick Balfour (MWB) has postponed the sale of its Malmaison and Hotel du Vin chains, citing turbulence in the global credit markets.  The announcement came just over a month after MWB insisted the sale of the chains  for a reported 700 million  was still on track despite market uncertainties.  MWB hired the Bank Of America in July to sell the businesses, which include 19 operating Malmaison and Hotel du Vin properties, plus two Hotel du Vin  sites due to open this autumn.  Quinlan Private and Robert Tchenguiz were thought to be strong contenders to buy the hotels, which were placed on the market after their proposed sale into Vector Hospitality collapsed when the Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reit) float was pulled earlier this year.
