By a staff reporter, with Reuters Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd, Australia's second biggest bank, says its cash earnings fell two per cent to $1.2 billion in the December quarter, as it shouldered $800 million in writedowns. Westpac said total lending rose 2.4 per cent in the three months, as mortgage and business lending showed good growth, while lending from the institutional side of the business, and in New Zealand, slowed. The bank also recorded strong growth in customer deposits, which increased 9.6 per cent in the quarter. In a market update for the December quarter, Westpac, which merged last year with then no. 5 bank St George Bank Ltd, said it had delivered a robust performance in a challenging environment in the first quarter of 2009. 'While impaired and stressed exposures have increased over the period consistent with the continued deterioration in the operating environment, Westpac's franchise is in sound shape,' Westpac chief executive Gail Kelly said. Mrs Kelly said Westpac had strengthened its capital position in the last four months, raising more than $3.8 billion in equity. She said the St George merger - the biggest-ever banking deal in Australia - was going well, with high levels of customer retention and engagement. 'Westpac is well positioned to continue to support customers through the cycle,' she said. Westpac said its pro-forma cash earnings for the three months to December 31 fell two per cent to $1.2 billion, on an unaudited basis. Impairment charges rose to $800 million in the quarter, from $144 million in the same quarter a year earlier. 'The December quarter impairment experience was impacted by a $360 million increase in provisions for the three large corporate exposures,' Westpac said. 'There are some bad-debt issues that are affecting all the banks but what we are seeing is that revenue margins are improving for the likes of Westpac and CBA in particular,' Paul Xiradis, chief executive at fund manager Ausbil Dexia, said.
