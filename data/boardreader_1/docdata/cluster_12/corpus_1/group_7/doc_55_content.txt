Photo-illustration: Harry Afentoglou  John Collett  February 18, 2009 Fund managers are quick to launch new funds and tardy in shutting down their lemons. Investment researcher Morningstar says Colonial First State, which is owned by the Commonwealth Bank, was the most prolific manufacturer of funds in 2008, with 87 new funds. Perpetual was the runner-up with 77 new funds.  And what is wrong with this? The problem is that the fund-management industry continues to launch more funds without killing off its duds.  With just under 11,000 individual managed funds on offer, Australia has the greatest number of managed funds per capita in the world, Morningstar says. There are more funds than shares listed on the sharemarket. It seems that sometimes the idea to launch funds comes from the fund managers' marketing departments rather than their investment staff.  Take the technology funds that were launched in 2000. Australian fund managers launched technology funds just before the US tech boom went bust in April-May 2000. The funds were launched at $1 a unit. But now these funds, run by the likes of ANZ , BT and AMP, have units worth less than 25 cents, with some as low as 11 cents.  There is no hope of investors getting their money back in their lifetimes. So instead of taking fees, why don't the managers run up the white flag and hand back to investors their much-diminished capital?  Geared share funds are another example of funds that seemed a good idea at the time but left their investors poorer. True, for a little while they made very good returns as the sharemarket boomed but geared funds investing in Australian shares lost up to 66 per cent in 2008. Over the three years to the end of 2008, the average annual losses were minus 18 per cent. Geared international share funds lost about 32 per cent over 2008 with average annual losses of about 3 per cent over three years.  Fund managers have also launched geared property funds with similar poor results for investors.  All this gearing increased the fee income for the providers of the products and for those who recommended them because the fees were charged as a percentage of the money invested.  Some managers have been closing more funds than they have been creating. According to Morningstar, AMP launched 42 funds in 2008 while shutting down 60. That is a step in the right direction. But top marks go to AXA, which shut down 67 funds while launching only six in 2008.  The financial services sector has a habit of launching and marketing products at the worst possible time for investors. One of the biggest growth sectors in recent years has been enhanced cash and higher yielding funds. These aim to produce higher returns than standard cash funds by holding asset-backed securities, short-term corporate bonds (including riskier non-investment grade corporate paper) and credit derivatives.  Many of these enhanced cash funds lost money last year, which would have surprised many of their investors, many of whom may have thought the funds would provide shelter from collapsing sharemarkets. Investors would have been better off leaving their cash in an online cash account.  Then there are the funds launched to capitalise on a particular investment theme or market. Examples are those that invest in emerging markets such as China and India, which sometimes will have an expensive capital guarantee and high fees.  The editorial and communications manager at Morningstar, Phillip Gray, says investors need to be cautious when it comes to trendy funds. 'Be sure that you know what you're getting into and invest on the basis of the fund playing a defined role in your overall investment strategy - not because it's the 'latest thing',' he says. 'Avoid investing on the basis of hype.' Gray says there is a role for specialist funds but reliance on them can lead to an investment portfolio lacking diversification. He says investors should check their portfolio has a sound balance of exposures to asset classes and investment styles while avoiding unnecessary costs and expenses.
