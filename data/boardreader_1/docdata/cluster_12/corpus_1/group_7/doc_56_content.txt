Presidential Financial announced the completion of a new credit facility with Bank of America. n addition, the company's primary shareholder, Harbert Private Equity Fund II, LLC, infused additional capital into Presidential. 'At a time when capital continues to be severely restricted for the small and mid-sized borrower, we are pleased that Presidential's capital base is intact, and has grown, in order to meet the increase in demand from companies across the country' said the company's CEO, Tom Matthesen, a veteran of the financial industry who was brought in a year ago to execute the company's growth plan. 'Throughout our 28 year history, there has never been a time when our ability to fund and to provide our clients with superior service has been more needed. Our lack of real estate exposure has kept our balance sheet clean while we seek to serve the needs of our working capital borrowers.' Presidential provides mid-sized commercial businesses with credit lines of $200,000 and up, and its healthcare division, Presidential Healthcare Credit, specializes healthcare financing with credit lines of $500,000 and up.
