Banks aiming to take advantage of the government's wholesale funding guarantee say overseas investor ignorance of New Zealand must be overcome before they can raise money.  The guarantee was announced by then finance minister Michael Cullen on November 1 at the height of the financial crisis, as alarm spread that local banks would be unable to roll over their huge foreign debts.  About 40%, or more than $100 billion, of bank funding is sourced overseas.  Since then only two banks - ANZ National and BNZ - have signed funding deeds with the Treasury and none has tapped wholesale markets for money using the guarantee.  On Tuesday the Treasury cut its fees for accessing the guarantee but ANZ National bank chief Graham Hodges said the cost wasn't the immediate problem. 'What has to happen before we can go to market and utilise the guarantee is that the analysts and the various funds managers and investment houses need to have analysed New Zealand, because it's the sovereign risk they need to have analysed,' he told the Sunday Star-Times.  Compared to 15 to 20 years ago, he said, government use of overseas bond markets had shrunk so much that investors no longer knew enough about New Zealand, despite its AA+ credit rating. 'The dealers and investors need to do the analytical work and form their views on it, and after that we can then come along and say 'here we are ANZ National bank, we're looking to borrow some money and by the way we've also got a New Zealand government guarantee' and they would understand what that means. 'Prior to them doing that earlier analysis, it would be meaningless for us to go to market.' Although the Reserve Bank is comfortable with banks' finances in the short term, there is concern about the shortage of buyers for longer-term debt internationally. The US Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday that it would buy US government debt was seen by some as a sign of a chronic shortage of cash in money markets.  Westpac NZ acting chief executive Bruce McLachlan said sovereign debt issuance was 'skyrocketing' as global recession took hold, 'so it's not surprising given all the uncertainty that the market will struggle to digest the volume of issuance'. In that context, he said, 'you've got to give people a reason why they would buy New Zealand [debt].' A joint Treasury/Reserve Bank roadshow to market New Zealand debt kicked off last week to address that problem, taking in Asian, European and US markets.  Thereafter the banks are expected to start trying to raise medium to long-term debt overseas using the government guarantee.  Although they can continue to function using short-term funding and other measures set up by the Reserve Bank, KPMG banking specialist Godfrey Boyce said having less mature debt left them vulnerable to further shocks.
