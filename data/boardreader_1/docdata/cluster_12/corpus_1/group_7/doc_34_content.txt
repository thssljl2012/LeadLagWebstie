FT reports: Michael Lindsay, the global head of real estate at KPMG's corporate finance arm, first visited Koh Samui in 1982, in the days when the Thai island barely featured in travel guides.  Thanks to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, he recently had a professional reason to return to the tourist hotspot. 'It was unrecognisable,' he says. In their role as liquidators, KPMG discovered that the failed US bank's Hong Kong operations made huge property investments in Asia, including in property developments across Thailand and China.
