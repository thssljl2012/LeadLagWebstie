Players in the insurance industry are warning that the economic recession has not yet reached its tail end and that investors should brace for more turmoil in the next two years.   AIG Kenya Insurance Company Managing Director Japh Olende also says the sector could see an increase premium charges owing to a sharp rise in the cost of imports due to the weakening Kenyan shilling.  Olende said escalation in claims due to the high cost of imports of vehicle spare-parts could see the charges on insurance premiums increase to cover the rising cost.  Speaking at a media briefing Wednesday, Olende and the Marketing Manager in charge of distribution, Catherine Igathe said 92 per cent of the Kenyan population lacks insurance cover, and with a market of penetration of just under 1.83 per cent for general insurance and 0.83 for life insurance, the sector is sitting pretty on a gold mine of opportunities.   Olende is also blaming low penetration of insurance services in the Kenyan market, on lack of proper legislation that ensures growth in the sector, he says bancassurance which has seen a sharp growth in other markets, has not been embraced fully in the Kenyan market yet it has better potential for growth.
