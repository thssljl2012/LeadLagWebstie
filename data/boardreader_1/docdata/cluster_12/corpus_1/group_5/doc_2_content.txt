Among six surveyed by the Business Journal, only two Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, with $1.4 trillion in assets, and much smaller UMB, a regional bank based in Kansas City, with $8 billion in assets posted higher profits in the third quarter than they did a year ago.  Bank of America reported net income of $2.8 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $2.7 billion a year earlier. UMB reported net income of $19.1 million, compared with $18.1 million.  UMB continues to benefit from its diversified business lines, said Tom Chulick, UMBs St. Louis chairman and chief executive. More than 50 percent of its revenue, an unusually high percentage, comes from fee income, such as investment banking, credit card services and trust and securities processing. It also grew its loan portfolio 7 percent in the quarter, to $4.2 billion. We are doing business with a lot of companies that are doing well, he said.
