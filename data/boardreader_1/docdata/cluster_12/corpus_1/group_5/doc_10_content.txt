SYDNEY, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group, Australia's fourth-largest lender, is expected to launch and price the first bond issued under an Australian government guarantee on Monday, a market source said. The 144a offer, expected to price during New York trade, will comprise 3- and 5-year tranches, the source said. Details including size and pricing are not available but the source said the offer will be large. Bank of America and JPMorgan are joint book runners with ANZ Securities acting as the third joint lead. A raft of Australian financial institutions are queuing up to raise funds in Europe and in the U.S. under a government guarantee programme which came into effect last week and aimed at helping them raise capital amid the global financial crisis. Westpac Banking Corp is expected to closely follow ANZ in the U.S. with a 5-year issue to be jointly led by Bank of America, HSBC and JPMorgan. The bond could price as early as Tuesday, another market source said. Macquarie Bank Ltd, Australia's top investment bank, said on Friday it was looking to sell early this week a US$ 5-year guaranteed bond in the United States. The 144a offer is jointly managed by bookrunners Barclays Capital and Goldman Sachs. Royal Bank of Scotland is the third joint lead. For more see.
