Offshore law firm Appleby will open its latest office in Zurich on December 15, headed by partner Jonathan Vanderkar, who has been a member of the banking and asset finance team in the firm's corporate commercial practice group.  Vanderkar, who joined Appleby in 2006 from Olswang in London, where he specialised in banking and structured film financing, has experience in corporate lending, project finance, asset-based lending, acquisition finance and securitisation. His clients include HSBC, Barclays, Bank of America, Miramax, Walt Disney and Paramount Pictures.  According to Appleby, the expansion into Zurich will enable it to extend the services it offers and provide clients and contacts in Switzerland with greater access to the range of jurisdictions in which Appleby operates.  The firm says the new office will reinforce its focus on high-growth international corporate and private wealth markets, providing direct access to offshore services for private banks, wealth managers and other institutions, as well as European, Middle Eastern and Asian clients whose funds are managed in Switzerland.  On the corporate side the office will focus on the insurance and funds sectors, providing access to the firm's specialist expertise in the Bermuda, Cayman, Mauritius, Jersey and BVI markets. Appleby is one of the so-called offshore magic circle law firms to open in Switzerland.  'Our driving strategy is to be the leading provider of legal, fiduciary and administration services in the offshore world,' says global group managing partner Peter Bubenzer. 'We see significant opportunities to expand our private wealth and corporate business in the Swiss market.  'The new office will provide our corporate, institutional and private clients with greater resources and a broader choice across the key offshore jurisdictions to suit their needs. We believe that the move will reinforce Appleby's position as the first choice for clients investing in or through the offshore sector.'
