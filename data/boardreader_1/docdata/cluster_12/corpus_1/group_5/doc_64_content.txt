The takeover of Wizard Home Loans by fellow non-bank lender Aussie Home Loans presents the prospect of lower rates for Wizard customers, Treasurer Wayne Swan says.  GE Money Australia and New Zealand will sell its Wizard Home Loans brand and franchise network in Australia to Aussie Home Loans for an undisclosed amount, it was announced on Wednesday.  While Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) will acquire up to $4 billion of mortgages originated by Wizard, GE Money said.  GE Money will continue to service all existing loans that it retains in the normal way.  Mr Swan welcomed the news, saying it should translate into a better deal for Wizard customers.'I think its a positive development because Wizard has been dramatically impacted upon by the global financial crisis and the cost of funds for it has been, I guess, much higher for that organisation than many others,' he told Fairfax.'So, I think this change that has been announced this morning holds out the prospect of some lower rates for many of the Wizard customers as this takeover moves through and certainly provides a much more solid foundation for that business.  Mr Swan said the move may even make the mortgage market more competitive than it had been in recent times.'Certainly I think it will mean that the new organisation will have access to funding which may be somewhat cheaper than the funding that Wizard has had in recent times.'And I think that for those customers of Wizard this will hold out the prospect of a better deal in time in terms of what they're paying.'10:00 AM   Wizard home loans is being sold to Aussie Home Loans, as a direct result of the global credit crunch.  The deal will see GE Money paid an undisclosed sum.  The Commonwealth Bank, who has a 33 percent share in Aussie, will refinance up to $4 billion worth of Wizard home loans.  Aussie's John Symond says the merger will make his company the biggest non-bank lender in the country.'Without the credit crunch having hit so hard there is no way in the world this transaction would have happened,' he told LIVENEWS.com.au.'It's very opportunisitic by Aussie Home Loans and it's very needed by Wizard customers because most of them would be paying a higher rate than what the market rate is.'
