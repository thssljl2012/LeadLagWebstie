A three-hectare development site in central Auckland has been sold for $43.5 million in what is believed to be the highest price ever paid for a property in New Zealand at auction.  The mortgagee sale was of the former Auckland City Council works depot, which is bordered by Cook, Nelson, Wellesley and Sale streets and was owned by developer Jamie Peters, of the Starline Group.  The land is leased to Victoria Quarter Depot Site Ltd, an arm of Australian developer Pelago, which plans to build the $1 billion Victoria Quarter complex of 20 commercial and apartment buildings on the site. Consent for the 10-year project was granted in May. Victoria Quarter Depot Site has an initial lease term of 20 years and six months over the land, with 21-year perpetual rights of renewal, and also owns the buildings.  Peters, a cousin of former foreign minister Winston Peters, also has valuable property interests in several other parts of the country including Canterbury and Queenstown. He bought his share of the central Auckland property from financier Bridgecorp. The property was put up for sale by first mortgagee Westpac Bank after it halted funding on the project a few weeks before the auction.  The identity of the local buyer has not been disclosed. However, site developer and Pelago director Doug Rikard-Bell said in the lead-up to the auction he was keen to buy the land.  David Bayley, of Bayleys Real Estate, who handled the sale with agent Rovert Platt on behalf of Westpac Bank, said the auction sale was the biggest in Bayleys' 35-year history. Platt said the property was marketed extensively around New Zealand and internationally. 'We were quite amazed by the interest. It is Auckland city's biggest redevelopment site and we were very impressed with the level of inquiry.'
