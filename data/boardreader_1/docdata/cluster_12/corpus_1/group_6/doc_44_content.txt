Iluka Resources' $209 million Murray Basin Stage Two mine at Kulwin, east of Ouyen, is expected to mine 2.4 million tonnes of sand by 2023.  The sand will be transported 300km south to Hamilton, where minerals such as zircon and rutile will be extracted for the manufacture of products such as paints, sunscreens, plastics and ceramic glazes.  In a statement, the state government said the Kulwin mine was expected to create more than 250 jobs during construction and 130 ongoing jobs.  Northern Victoria MP Candy Broad said sand mining was an 'emerging industry' in Victoria that the government was committed to supporting.
