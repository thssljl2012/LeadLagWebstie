(RTTNews) - Financial giant JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) Thursday reported over 76% decline in fourth-quarter profit, principally due to higher loan loss reserves. Looking ahead to 2009, the company warned that if the economic environment worsens further, it is reasonable to expect additional negative impact on its market-related businesses.  The New York-based company reported fourth-quarter net income of $702 million, much lower than $2.971 billion reported in the year-ago period. Earnings per share for the just concluded quarter dropped to $0.07 from $0.86 reported last year.  During the latest period, the company reported a $4.1 billion pretax increase to loan loss reserves, a $2.9 billion pretax net markdowns due to leveraged lending exposures and mortgage-related positions in the Investment Bank as well as a $1.1 billion after tax benefit from merger-related items.  The quarter also included non-recurring $854 million after-tax benefit from MSR risk management results, $680 million after tax private equity write-downs, and $627 million after-tax gain due to dissolution of Paymentech joint venture.  Barclays Capital said on Wednesday that it expects JPMorgan to report a fourth-quarter loss of $0.20 per share. The brokerage said sequentially it expects results to include a significant increase in credit costs along further reserve building and weak investment banking results led by lower originations. Losses in trading, private equity and principal transactions are expected to continue, it added.  The company operates through six segments: Investment Bank, Retail Financial Services, Card Services, Commercial Banking, Treasury and Securities Services, and Asset Management.  The Investment Bank segment reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.364 billion, compared to a profit of $124 million in the previous year, reflecting a decrease in net revenue as well as a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower non-interest expense.  For the Retail Financial Services division, net income dropped to $624 million from $731 million. The company noted that the decline in profit in this segment was 15% as a significant increase in the provision for credit losses was predominately offset by positive MSR risk management results and the positive impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.  Fourth-quarter net loss at Card Services segment was $371 million compared to net income of $609 million in the previous year, driven by a higher provision for credit losses, though partially offset by higher net revenue.  Commercial Banking's net income for the quarter increased to $480 million from $288 million in the previous year, helped by higher net revenue, including the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, offset partially by higher provision for credit losses.  Treasury and Securities Services reported a fourth-quarter increase in net income to $533 million from $422 million, owing to higher net revenue, though partially offset by higher non-interest expense.  Profit at the Asset Management segment plunged to $255 million from $527 million due to lower net revenue offset partially by lower non-interest expense.  In the Corporate/Private Equity segment, net income surged to $1.545 billion from $270 million in the previous year. This segment includes the results of Private Equity and Corporate business segments, as well as merger-related items. Last year, the company made two key purchases - the struggling save and thrift Washington Mutual, or WaMu, and investment bank Bear Stearns. However, these acquisitions are not expected to translate into benefits soon.  Total net revenue for the quarter edged down to $17.226 billion from $17.384 billion in the previous year.

During the year, the firm increased its total allowance for loan losses to $23.2 billion, resulting in a firmwide coverage ratio of 3.16%.  Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, 'Our fourth-quarter financial results were very disappointing, driven by a loss in Investment Banking largely attributable to continued markdowns on leveraged loans and mortgage trading positions, as well as weak trading results. We also faced higher credit costs associated with continued deterioration across our loan portfolios, including a $4.1 billion addition to loan loss reserves.  Despite all these, JPMorgan is regarded as one among the healthiest companies, compared to its competitors, due to stronger management as well as less international presence. The company has so far weathered the credit crunch well.  On October 15, JPMorgan reported an 84% plunge in third-quarter profit, driven by markdowns on mortgage trading positions and leveraged loans, and higher credit costs due to continued deterioration in its home-lending portfolio. JPMorgan reported net income of $527 million or $0.11 per share, a decline from $3.373 billion or $0.97 per share reported in the third quarter of 2007. Total net revenue for the quarter dropped to $14.737 billion from $16.112 billion reported last year.

Another peer Citigroup Inc. (C) reported a hefty third-quarter loss of $2.82 billion in last October, hurt by write-downs and higher consumer credit costs. Revenues were down 23% from last year to $16.68 billion, reflecting poor performances from Global Cards and Institutional Clients divisions, and the North American and Latin American regions.  German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG (DB   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) said on Wednesday that it currently expects a hefty net loss in the fourth quarter, compared to a profit last year, hurt by exceptional market conditions that severely hit sales and trading businesses, mainly in Credit Trading.  Looking ahead to 2009, Dimon, continued, 'If the economic environment deteriorates further, which is a distinct possibility, it is reasonable to expect additional negative impact on our market-related businesses, continued higher loan losses and increases to our credit reserves.'
