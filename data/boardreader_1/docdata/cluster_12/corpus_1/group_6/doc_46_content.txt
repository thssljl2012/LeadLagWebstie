SYDNEY - Commonwealth Bank of Australia has added A$350 million ($US234 million) to its issue of government-backed fixed rate notes due in 2013 sold in December, CBA said on Wednesday.   The increase paid 100 basis points (bps) over swap, tighter than its initial price of 120 bps, reflecting an easing in funding costs for Australia's major banks.   This tap brings the total size of the fixed rate tranche to A$2.36 billion.   The initial offer, sold on December 10, consisted of A$1.9 billion of fixed rate and A$300 million of floating notes.   Australian banks are rushing to raise funds worldwide under a new government guarantee to help them shore up their balance sheets amid the global financial turmoil.   Australia's move follows similar guarantees introduced in other countries.   Over US$29 billion in government-guaranteed bonds has now been raised by Australian banks since December 10.
