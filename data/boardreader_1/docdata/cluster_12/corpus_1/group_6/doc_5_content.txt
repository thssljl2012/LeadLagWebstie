China Investment Corp. (CIC) has been buying shares of Industrial and commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (SSE:601398), China Construction Bank (CCB) (SSE:601939), and Bank of China (BOC) (SSE:601988). Lou Jiwei, chairman of CIC, made the remark in Beijing on Friday, and said CIC had been watching closely investors' sales of these banks' shares in the H share market.   Some foreign strategic investors, which were imported amid the commercial reform of China's state-owned banks, are selling shares of these banks under the backdrop of financial crisis.   The RBS Group sold its 4.26 per cent stake in BOC Tuesday, two weeks after UBS divested all its 3.4 billion shares. Bank of America sold US$2.83 billion of CCB stock on January 7.   Lou also said that CIC would continue its overseas investment.
