Goodman Property Trust has completed the renewal of its $900 million of debt-funding facilities.  Goodman (NZ) Ltd chief executive John Dakin said in November the trust had renewed $481 million of debt for a 3-year term, and said today the trust had renewed the whole of its $630 million main debt facility, which is from a syndicate of 5 trading banks - ANZ, BNZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Kiwibank &amp;amp; Westpac. Mr Dakin said the trust had also completed the renewal of $272 million of debt facilities in its joint-venture investments, that were also due to expire in late 2009. We are extremely pleased to report that the refinancing programme has been completed a year ahead of its expiry and in a very challenging credit market. The commitment of the major trading banks to the new 3-year facilities reflects the strength of Goodman Property Trusts business &amp;amp; investment strategy. The trusts debt:equity ratio equates to 31.4%, rising to 33.5% when all current commitments are included. The facilities can provide over $200 million in additional funding capacity. Mr Dakin said: While the cost of the new facilities is higher than previously, the early debt renewals provide real security to the business &amp;amp; its debt funding requirements. The increased cost of funding has been taken into account, with our forecast cash distribution on 10c/unit for the current financial year. Want to comment? Email .
