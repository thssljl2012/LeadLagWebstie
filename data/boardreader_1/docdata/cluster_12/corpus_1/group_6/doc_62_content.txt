CANBERRA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Australia's government is planning to set up a fund to help companies refinance billions of dollars in foreign bank loans if they are not rolled over in the next two years, the Australian newspaper reported on Thursday.   The fund would involve the government lending directly to businesses, with money raised through the sale of government bonds, but would also involve Australia's major banks, said the newspaper in the unsourced report.   The centre-left government had been talking to the country's four main banks since before Christmas, with negotiations steered by David Murray, the former Commonwealth Bank of Australia CEO, said the Australian newspaper.   Half the money for the fund would come from the country's top four banks -- National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Group and Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Corp -- the paper said.   Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has said foreign banks represent more than half of the A$285 billion in syndicated loans issued to Australian businesses since 2006. Of the total loans remaining, A$75 billion ($49 billion) were due over the next two years, but it unclear how much of that is held by foreign banks.   Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner said on Thursday foreign bank loans involved large and profitable companies.   'It's not certain there will be a serious gap, but given what's happening to many major foreign banks internationally, there is clearly a risk that we have to be concerned about,' Tanner told local radio.   Tanner said Australian banks were also restrained by the amount they can lend to any one company as a proportion of their capital.
