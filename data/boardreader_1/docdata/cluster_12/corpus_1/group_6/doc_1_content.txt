The trustee of property lender Dominion Finance Group has applied to have the company liquidated in February, putting an end to the business it called receivers into last September.  But receiver Rod Partington of Deloitte says the liquidation application will not affect the progress of the receivership. Its another step in the process.  At the time of receivership, Dominion Finance Group had outstanding creditors owed $233 million. Receivers said in their first report they expected to be able to return between 10c and 25c in the dollar.  Just under 6000 investors held debenture stock worth $177 million. Ranking equally with them was $55 million owed to the Bank of Scotland International and ASB Bank.  The companys trustee Perpetual Trust has applied for the liquidation.  Dominion Finance Group was one of two subsidiaries of the listed Dominion Finance Holdings which struggled to stay alive last year. Group founder Terry Butler battled unsuccessfully for a moratorium, while investors in the groups other main subsidiary, North South Finance, agreed to a moratorium on December 1.  The listed companys future was put in limbo in October, when voluntary administrators were appointed to it and control of the various entities moved into the hands of different sets of insolvency practitioners.  The group began 2008 telling the market it expected to make a profit of about $14 million for the March 2008 year, but everything went downhill from there. In May it said that profit was just under $9 million.  But the most recent announcement from any of the group is telling  North South released its result for the March 2008 year on January 9, revealing that it had negative equity of $9.4 million, assets of $98 million, liabilities of $107 million.  The Dominion Finance Group liquidation application will go before the High Court in Auckland on 20 February.
