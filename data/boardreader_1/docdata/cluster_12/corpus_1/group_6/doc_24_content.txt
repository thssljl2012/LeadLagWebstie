Article from:   The Australian  STORM Financial put forward a bailout plan to the Commonwealth Bank a month before it collapsed, but the bank rejected it.  According to documents filed with the Federal Court of Australia, on the evening of December 4 last year, Storm put a proposal that it borrow funds from the bank to cover negative equity positions on margin loans by Storm clients.  The documents say Storm wanted to 'borrow from the bank a sufficient sum to recover the lost funds represented by this negative equity'.  'Storm would then, by some means provide financial assistance to the relevant clients in the same amount so that they could recover the negative equity positions (without selling their own assets or otherwise devoting their own funds at the time) and, in the period of the ensuing year or two, work to recover such shortfall.'  Storm co-founder Emmanuel Cassimatis said he intended that Commonwealth would regard this as a 'generous offer' because Storm would take on the primary liability in a direct relationship with the bank.  Storm went into administration on Friday after being asked by Commonwealth to repay a corporate debt facility believed to be worth up to $20 million.  Up to 14,000 clients, mostly from Queensland, have been caught in the Storm debacle.  In 2007, Storm -- which mainly advised clients to leverage their assets through margin loans into indexed products -- had about $4.5 billion in funds and loans under administration.  It is understood total funds under management for the four Storm Index Funds managed by Colonial First State -- a Commonwealth subsidiary -- stood at $600 million at mid-October last year.  In early December, it had dropped to $50 million.  By the end of November, Mr Cassimatis said, Storm clients who had taken up margin loans with the bank faced a negative equity position of about $37 million.  In delivering the rescue proposal on December 4, Storm said: 'We are all in this situation' and'clearly see' it is the responsibility of both Storm and Commonwealth, 'and all parties may have done things differently in hindsight'.  'However, no one wins from an attitude that is one-sided.'  Commonwealth rejected the proposal, the court documents show.  The Australian understands the alleged rescue package focused on a large amount of unsecured lending being provided to Storm.  Commonwealth, according to the court documents, said: 'Although they are Storm's customers -- in that you are their financial adviser and planner, recommending their investment strategy including borrowings to invest in certain products -- they are also Colonial Margin Lending customers. In that, while we have not provided them advice, we have provided lending facilities to them.' At the time, it is alleged, Commonwealth had 'concern' about 640 Storm margin loan accounts.  The Australian Securities and Investment Commission is investigating the margin loan matter.  Law firm Slater &amp; Gordon is believed to be weeks away from initiating legal action on behalf of 230 Storm clients with margin loans against a number of banks, including Commonwealth and Bank of Queensland.  It is expected to seek damages of more than $100 million.
