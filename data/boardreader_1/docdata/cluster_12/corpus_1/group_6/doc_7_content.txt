Foamex International Inc. said Friday that it is talking with lenders about restructuring its First Lien Term Loans.  The company (OTCBB:FMXL) also said that in consideration of its best long-term interest, Foamex has not made the $7.3 million interest payment on its First Lien and Second Lien Loans that was due by Jan. 21, 2009.

We continue to have enough cash to support our daily operations and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the agent for our Revolving Credit facility, continues to work constructively with us.
