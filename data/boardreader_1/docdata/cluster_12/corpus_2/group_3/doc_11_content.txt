         Excellent article by Jeff Randall.  We are over banked in this country, and need a purge of these worthless paper shufflers, but protect depositers.   I recently visited Kingston-upon-Thames, where there is a blight of banks in the centre. On one street alone, there were five or six. I checked online and discovered that in this one wealthy town there are three Barclays, two HSBCs, plus branches of Royal Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Cheltenham &amp;amp;amp; Gloucester, Alliance &amp;amp;amp; Leicester, Northern Rock, Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley, Lloyds TSB, Co-operative Bank, Abbey, NatWest, Household Bank, and Beneficial Finance  I may have missed a couple.     http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/jeffrandall/31122...
