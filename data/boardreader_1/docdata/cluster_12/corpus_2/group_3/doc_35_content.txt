 Also, I suspect most people are confusing &amp;amp;quot;premier&amp;amp;quot; banking offers with actual private banking.    With Barclays for example, you&amp;#039;ll find premier banking on our .co.uk website. You won&amp;#039;t find private banking, though - that&amp;#039;s done through Barclays Wealth and is almost completely distinct from retail operations.    You&amp;#039;ll also usually find that your &amp;amp;quot;premier&amp;amp;quot; equivalent relationship manager has a portfolio of hundreds, where as a private banker will have tens.     And yes, a large part of private banking is just going golfing and the like.
