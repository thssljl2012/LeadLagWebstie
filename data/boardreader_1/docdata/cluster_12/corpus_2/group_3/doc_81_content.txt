A further $0.25 million per club   is due to be paid next year.      &amp;amp;#9632;  A total of $6.3 million was paid from the AFLs Annual Special   Distribution fund to  the Western Bulldogs ($1.7 million), the   Kangaroos Football Club ($1.4 million),  Melbourne Football   Club ($1 million),  Sydney Swans Football Club ($0.7 million),   Richmond Football Club ($0.4 million), Hawthorn Football Club   ($0.25 million), and  Port Adelaide Football Club ($0.25 million),    with $0.6 million paid to Telstra Dome to assist clubs playing   at this venue.      &amp;amp;#9632; Other payments to clubs include distribution of the AFLs   signage rights at Telstra Dome, prizemoney, travel subsidies   and to help clubs develop the game around Australia.      2007 payments to clubs   Club Base Other Total   Adelaide 4,913,256 1,872,325 6,785,581   Brisbane Lions 4,913,256 1,909,383 6,822,639   Carlton 4,913,256 3,667,898 8,581,154   Collingwood 4,913,256 3,293,892 8,207,148   Essendon 4,913,256 2,754,565 7,667,821   Fremantle 4,913,256 2,012,985 6,926,241   Geelong 4,913,256 3,258,771 8,172,027   Hawthorn 4,913,256 2,458,330 7,371,586   Kangaroos 4,913,256 4,103,769 9,017,025   Melbourne 4,913,256  3,326,069  8,239,325   Port Adelaide 4,913,256  2,614,680  7,527,936   Richmond 4,913,256 2,914,996 7,828,252   St Kilda 4,913,256 3,021,030 7,934,286   Sydney Swans 4,913,256 2,865,009 7,778,265   West Coast Eagles 4,913,256 2,231,128 7,144,384   Western Bulldogs 4,913,256 4,570,340 9,483,596   Total 78,612,096 46,875,169 125,487,265                        The &amp;amp;quot;Other&amp;amp;quot; amount includes $1.2mil from TV monies which is fixed for 5 years, $250k from the Waverley Park sale proceeds and $155k from settlement of the C7 court case. All 16 clubs got this $1.6mil as part of their other payments.      We made the finals so that means our other amount includes $600k runners up prize money and a finals allowance the AFL pays the clubs who made finals, in our total, Yes you had 1,767 AFL members compared to our 164 and that&amp;#039;s a difference of maybe $120k to $150k in the others total in your favour, but you can still see there is a big difference between what extras your club got over mine.      And what is the value of this bank guarantee the AFL gives to 10 clubs? Without it you wouldn&amp;#039;t survive because you are technically insolvent with a deficiency of net assets of $4mil to $5mil.       http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_...eFinancial.pdf            Quote:                          4.
