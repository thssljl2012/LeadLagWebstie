          I have been left what reads as 400.000 shares (group 1) in legal &amp;amp;amp; general. The account product is &amp;amp;quot; L&amp;amp;amp;G (barclays)MM UK core fund (A)&amp;amp;quot; i have less than the faintest idea of what this means or value.   This seems to be a Legal and General OEIC (Open Ended Investment Company).  See the first entry on this page:   http://www.legalandgeneral.com/investment/fundprice6.jsp   Gaz
