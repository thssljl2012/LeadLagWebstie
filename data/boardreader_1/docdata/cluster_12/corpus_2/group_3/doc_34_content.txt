  They&amp;#039;ll be in Newark before Brooklyn....    Atlantic Yards Grounbreaking on Pause for 6 Months  Eminent domain lawsuit allowed to go forward   by Matthew Schuerman   NEW YORK, NY September 29, 2008 --The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court decided to allow buisness owners and residetns to sue the massive real estate project in central Brooklyn.  WNYC&amp;#039;s Mathew Schuerman has more.  While the plaintiffs lost a similar case in federal court, the state proceedings will delay the project right as a recession is threatening.  The project&amp;#039;s developer, Forest City Ratner, had announced that a groundbreaking on the Barclays Center basketball arena would take place by the end of this year.  But a ground can&amp;#039;t be broken before the project secures financing, and the financing won&amp;#039;t come before all litigation is resolved. In an official statement today, the developer, Forest City Ratner, says it is confident it will build the arena.  FIGHT THE POWER!
