 CVTX Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 7              Barclay&amp;#039;s Capital initiates coverage with $22 target price   Barclay&amp;#039;s Capital, which acquired Lehman&amp;#039;s operation, issued an initial coverage report on 9/26/08.&amp;amp;nbsp; Their price target has been established at $22, reduced from Lehman&amp;#039;s only by virtue of applying a 20x multiple and 25% risk discount vs. Lehman&amp;#039;s 25x and 20% risk discount on the same earnings estimates.&amp;amp;nbsp;       In this market, the $22 target is MUCH MORE REALISTIC than what has been a long-standing Lehman target.&amp;amp;nbsp; If the substantially better labeling is achieved, partnering is established (with enhancement of financial position), and scrip growth is achieved, the target and beyond is definitely achievable over time.       Interestingly, Jim Birchenough&amp;#039;s name appears on the certification.&amp;amp;nbsp; He was reported to have gone elsewhere.      The following important note appears on the report:&amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;quot;Barclays Capital Inc. does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report..&amp;quot; &amp;amp;nbsp; This should definitely be kept in mind when evaluating what is being put forth.      Connect the dots.      ValueSleuth&amp;amp;nbsp;       Below is the verbiage from the report:        Investment Conclusion      We are initiating coverage on CVTX with a 1-OW and $22 price target. With recent approval and partnership of Ranexa in Europe, impending label expansion for Ranexa in the US, launch of Lexiscan by partner Astellas and continued OPEX discipline, we believe CVTX is on the cusp of sustainable profitability and value creation.      Summary      CVTX has transformed itself in 2008 from a struggling single product company with heavy cash burn to a near profitable multi-therapeutic growth name with multiple growth drivers. Following successful approval and partnership of Ranexa in Europe, approval and launch of Lexiscan in the US and partial monetization of Lexiscan royalties focus is now on potential for significant label expansion for Ranexa in the US.      With initial draft labelling expected in mid-August, we believe that MERLIN study data support an unrestricted angina indication and anti-arrythmia claim as well as potential HbA1c reduction claim. Given physician tentativeness around QTc warnings, we expect a significant inflection in Ranexa trends and would highlight a 3rd line opportunity of 2.5mln patients and $5B in sales as likely to attract large pharma interest.      *We are maintaining a Neutral rating on the US Biotechnology sector which balances historic low valuations with challenges to maturing franchises, slowing product growth, increasing competitive pressures and a more difficult FDA and payor environment.      *Our rating on CVTX is inline with our prior Lehman Brothers rating while our price target is reduced to $22 from our prior target of $29. We arrive at our new $22 price target by applying a 20x multiple vs 25x previously to unchanged 2010 EPS estimate $1.69 and discounting at 25% vs 20% previously. The 20x multiple is inline with that afforded profitable biotech companies while the 25% discount better reflects risk.
