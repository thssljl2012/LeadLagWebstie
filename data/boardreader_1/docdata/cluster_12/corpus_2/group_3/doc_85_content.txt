No... no parochialism.                      Sydney Olympic Park is no white elephant.       The transformation of the Homebush Bay precinct incorporating the suburbs of Sydney Olympic Park, Rhodes and Homebush Bay as well as the developments North of the river at Ryde and Meadowbank are turning this whole district into quite a dynamic area.       Sydney Olympic Park itself is seeing quite a bit of construction activity with a third major hotel just recently opening its doors as well as the construction of office towers for CBA and planned high density housing for the area and Acer Arena is booked with shows almost every weekend.       The whole district is transforming with Higher denisty housing with a large white collar workforce working there and an evolving more upmarket Retail sector as well. The new boardwalk along Meadowbank (or Shepherds Bay as it seems to be known under its gentrified name..lol) looks great along the shores of the Parramatta River with excellent PT choices of either Trains, Ferries or buses.       This whole district is evolving. A white elephant it is not.
