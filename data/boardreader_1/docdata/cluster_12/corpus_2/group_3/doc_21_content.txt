For a start, one is very big and the other is tiny.                      Anglo Irish assets &amp;amp;#8364;101bn (3/08)  Allied Irish assets &amp;amp;#8364;183bn (6/08)     not that different - both are small/medium sized banks     Barclays assets  1,365 bn (6/08)                                                          Last edited by gozomark : 01-10-2008 at  6:21 AM .
