       The savings rate at Stanbic Bank or Barclays in Zimbabwe last year were indeed 15% . . . but that was the monthly rate, for an annual rate of roughly 600%.  With Zimbabwean inflation this year at 11 million percent, the savings rate is correspondingly higher - changed daily.  But there is now such a currency shortage that withdrawals are limited to $20,000 Zimbabwe per day. This limit does not apply to debit card transactions, otherwise the economy would be at a halt.   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1064649/Tens-thousands-flood-Zimbabwe-banks-11-000...   Both Stanbic and Barclay&amp;#039;s Zimbabwe remain profitable, even on an inflation adjusted basis. It&amp;#039;s amazing what people can adapt to. .
