 Too complicated in my opinion. The IP helpers work great, and the   functionality is blessed by the RFC&amp;#039;s. They work well for all   environments- local as well as remote subnets.       BTW: The same setup is also needed to support PXE clients if they are on   a subnet other than the PXE server. The IP helpers in this case would   include the PXE server as well. If the PXE server is different from the   DHCP server, the IP helpers would have the DHCP as well as the PXE   server in the list.      ________________________________    From: ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org   &amp;amp;#91mailto:ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org&amp;amp;#93 On Behalf Of AFidel@ddrc.com   Sent: Wednesday, October 08, 2008 10:30 AM   To: ActiveDir@mail.activedir.org   Subject: RE: &amp;amp;#91ActiveDir&amp;amp;#93 DHCP RELAY?

That depends on all the subnets being in the same location usually. If   you&amp;#039;re centrally delivering DHCP to the branch office then this won&amp;#039;t   work.

Another method I&amp;#039;ve seen if you dont particularly want to enable   iphelper across disparate links is the ability to create virtual   interfaces (Broadcom NICs as far I know do this), and just trunk your   DHCP ports to have multiple VLANs..   not saying this is good or bad,   but I have seen it.

Hi,       I am segmenting my network in several vlans for security a bandwidth   reason.       How do I go about using the same DHCP server for all the vlans? Someone   told me that I have to enable DHCP relay, I know how to do that in the   switches but I don&amp;#039;t know how to configure the dhcp server to offer the   right IP address depending on the VLAN.
