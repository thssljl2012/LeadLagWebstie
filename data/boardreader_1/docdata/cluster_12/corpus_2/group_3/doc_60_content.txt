         Looking at the presentations by Fred for RBS and John Varley for Barclays, it is easy to see why the city has no confidence at all in RBS. Fred&amp;#039;s was completely in denial about the problems whilst Varleys was a reasoned exposition of what the problems have been, what Barclays have been doing about it and how this fits in to the future. NOT encouraging sadly!
