Number 1:  These owners are BILLIONAIRES.  They are not in the business to make a profit.  This is pure ego for them.    Number 2:  Many of them bought these teams when they worth a lot less then now.  Sure players salaries are escalating but so are team values.  Revenue itself isn&amp;#039;t that important, I am sure they are happy to break even.  Number 3: I don&amp;#039;t believe this bull that only 5-7 teams are profitable, Stern and the Owners are posturing for a better CBA the next time around.
