         Mank1  Re Barclays  From experience problem is that every person in organization from local business manager you go through will try to get deal for themselves to meet their own targets and may not have access to the best rates.  For property  secured loan s/facilities of 500,00 to 2,000,000 you need to get to the  Barclays Corporate &amp;amp;quot;Property Specialist&amp;amp;quot; Relationship Manager.  There are about 40 in the country.  They will look evidence of at least 3 similar projects already completed and proof of availability of the additional development funds required.  Also very focused on the exit strategy.  A couple of months ago ratios were 70% purchase and 70% development, 1% set up, base plus 2-2.5%+  Will usually be at lower end of what you can borrow but at good rates for solid projects  Also looking at BTL portfolios with very conservative ratios.  Not checked recently  regards  xx101
