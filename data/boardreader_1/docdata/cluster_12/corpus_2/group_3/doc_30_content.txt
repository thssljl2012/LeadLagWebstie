&amp;gt;                             How else are people supposed to make their feelings known in a practical way then, left side d? If people hadn&amp;#039;t boycotted Barclays over their support for South Africa, or don&amp;#039;t boycott Nestle over the baby milk scandal, how else are we going to have any positive effect on the behaviour of these unaccountable multinationals? They certainly won&amp;#039;t take any notice of letters, emails, or even protests. The only message they understand is when their profits dive. Why should Kassam be any different? And why are you getting so defensive about it? Any boycott could only be voluntary, so no one is forcing you or anyone else to go without their Priory pint or their next Bowlplex strike (or split, in my case).   www.rageonline.co.uk  The Conference&amp;#039;s BIGGEST independent fans&amp;#039; website
