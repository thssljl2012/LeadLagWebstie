                    Philippines 1st World                                          Quote:                                Originally Posted by  umpa_umpa                         It&amp;#039;s good to know that there is someone other than the Pres. Arroyo who supports the dream of the Philippines into becoming a first-world country. Manny Pangilinan is very optimistic in his ambition to see the Philippines become a first-world country. Even if its achievement is still far, at least some big people in the Philippines believe that it is attainable. If the economy continues to grow every year, employment rates increase, slow inflation, and stable politics, we may become a first-world nation then.                      The key words are continues to grow.      The economic crisis in the US is not over (the 700 billion bailout will not be enough) and now Europe is beginning to re-nationalize its banks. Ireland and Iceland were considered the models of neo-liberal economic policies. They were the first ones to deregulate banking and privatize government services. Now they have closed their stock markets and began to seize retail and banks in order to avoid a consumer panic.    So as the government is saying &amp;amp;quot;don&amp;#039;t worry the economy is good&amp;amp;quot;, what they are not saying is that most Middle Eastern investments are in European banks and most East Asian investments are in American banks and insurance companies like AIG (which had substantial holdings in Hong Kong). Since the Philippines has been in a recession for the past 1 to 2 years (but the remittances are being counted as Direct Foreign Investments so it looks like the foreign investor confidence which builds consumer confidence, etc), the Philippines won&amp;#039;t feel anything yet. But by early next year you&amp;#039;ll start to see countries getting tougher on immigration and guest-worker programs. In Europe, the economy is expect to retract by .3% in the 2nd quarter of next year according to the German government.  The ADB also says that the world growth rate will be less than 5%. Now we also see that LAtin America is not having a problem with the drop in prices in soy, oil, and corn so by the 1st quarter of next year they will be in recession. To think that the crisis in Europe and the US--which is being called the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression-- won&amp;#039;t affect the Philippines is naive.      There are a number of reasons why the Philippines won&amp;#039;t be a first world country by 2025 outside of the bad world economic outlook:      1. Corruption takes nearly 15% of the GDP;   2. The income disparity;    3. The small LGUs and provincial structure makes it difficult to coordinate national projects;   4. The ongoing insurrection in the North and the South;   5. The neo-liberal policies (i.e. JPEPA) which actually hurt the growth of Filipino owned infant and cottage industries (i.e. rice);   6. Lack of physical infrastructure (i.e. paved roads);   7. Lack of human infrastructure (i.e. education institutions tailoring to local needs rather than overseas needs);   8. Lack of land reform (i.e. CARP is ineffective);   9. Poor tax collection and (i.e. rich undervalue their incomes, the Catholic Church is the largest landowner in the country and owns malls yet and fast food joints yet does not pay taxes, etc);   10. Filipino quality and consumer habits (i.e. Filipino quality control is substandard compared to Japanese and Europeans; Filipino habit of buying American products which in turn does not improve quality control, etc)   11. Foreign capital is higher than internal capital (i.e. more foreigners have capital invested in the Philippines than the money that is available local which inflates real estate and consumer goods);   12. Cultural anomalies (i.e. management based on family relations and what college one attended rather than merit)   13. Lack of savings (i.e.which could be used by banks for industrialization);
