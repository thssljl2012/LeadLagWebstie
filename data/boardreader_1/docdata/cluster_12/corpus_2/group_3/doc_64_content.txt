 Sounds like you have a leak either in the memory usage or other   resources such as handles etc. Configure task manager to show you the   paged pool, non-paged pool and virtual memory. Check whether any process   is using abnormal amounts of either, that is most likely your culprit.   The more scientific way to do it would be to trend these values for each   process for some period of time and see which process shows an ever   increasing trend.      What else runs on the box?       ________________________________    From: ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org   &amp;amp;#91mailto:ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org&amp;amp;#93 On Behalf Of Patrick Paul   Sent: Thursday, October 16, 2008 9:20 PM   To: ActiveDir@mail.activedir.org   Subject: &amp;amp;#91ActiveDir&amp;amp;#93 DC Issues      I have a DC  that is doing some weird things    1.       Stops DHCP Service    2.       Then drops itself from the domain    3.       Would not let you logon with the domain admin account once it   has dropped out of the domain    I am at my wits end on this one. We have SCOM on the network and all it   does is give me some cryptic statement saying the &amp;quot;DHCP service has   stopped&amp;quot;    I just need some direction on this   one...................................      thanks     --     This message and any attachments are confidential, proprietary, and may be privileged.
