           To which I would add for the HYP board, I have not mentioned dividends. However, I have no intention of crystallising significant loss just because there are no dividends. For dividends, they are going to have to come from rest of a divesified growing portfolio.    Prof103 As ever, an excellent point raised by yourself. This is almost certainly one of the best examples of the need for a well diversified portfolio that many of us will see throughout our entire investing careers.  My holding of RBS is minimal, but a much larger holding in Barclays. Passing the final 2008 dividend (even though Varley had previously committed to holding it at the 2007 level in cash) will be painful but will be at least partly covered by dividend income received from the rest of my balanced HYP.  Thanks again for an excellent point.  Regards  Larky
