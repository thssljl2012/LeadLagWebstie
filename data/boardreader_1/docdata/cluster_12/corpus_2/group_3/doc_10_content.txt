Readability therefore becomes much more important for the average-sized identity-graphic investor.                      So the woman who designed the logo for $35 would have been slammed by you guys before its mass funding? Funding plays one part, but the logo itself is the real heroin!    Take a look at the Commonwealth Bank logo (Australian bank), it was meant to represent the southern cross (a group of stars in the South West of Australia), but no one was the wiser and yet the logo is praised... similar situation... Would the logo of failed without the funding? In my opinion no...
