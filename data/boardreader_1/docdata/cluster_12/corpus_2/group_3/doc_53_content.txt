         Generally speaking, the UK&amp;#039;s Financial Services Compensation Scheme does not extend to the offshore financial centres. But there is an exception, reported in the Daily Mail this week:  http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/saving-and-banking/article.html...   Scroll about half way down the page to the table listing the different situations in the various offshore centres. Look at Gibraltar:  most UK banks and building societies include their Gibraltar operations within their UK operations, so depositors are covered by the UK&amp;#039;s FSCS.  UK banks on island: Barclays, Lloyds TSB and the Leeds, Newcastle and Norwich &amp;amp;amp; Peterborough building societies (all covered by FSCS).  That is different from the situation with UK banks in IOM and the Channel Islands.  Owen
