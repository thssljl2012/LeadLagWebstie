As a reminder, today&amp;#039;s call is being recorded.    At this time, then, I would like to turn the conference over to Justin Victoria, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.     Justin R. Victoria - Vice President, Investor Relations     Thank you operator. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call. We are here to review Wyeth third quarter 2008 performance and offer some thoughts for our vision of the future at Wyeth.    On the call with me today are Bernard Poussot, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wyeth; Greg Norden, Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Mahady, President of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.    As a reminder, certain statements that are made today, that are not historical facts are by their nature forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking information. This has been more fully disclosed in our press release and in our periodic SEC reports, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the annual report on Form 10-K including the caption Risk Factors.    Now let me turn the call over to Bernard Poussot.     Bernard Poussot - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer     Thank you Justin and good morning. And thank you for joining us. While we find ourselves in times of unprecedented global economic turmoil and uncertainty that affect the future of the world economy, I am pleased to be able to start our comments by reporting that our pro forma results for the third quarter are on target and in line with consensus.    Sales were up 4% this quarter, IBT up 4% and EPS was $0.90. I will also note that year-to-date we are indeed ahead of our initial time for the year in both revenue and income. Year-to-date revenue is up 5%, IBT up 3% and EPS reached $2.75.    The plan we set in place in the early days of 2008 to respond to the at-risk launch of generic pantoprazole is delivering its promise. We are executing on that plan and our performance to date for 2008 is on or ahead of target for revenue generation, spending reduction and overall financial achievements.    So let me spend a few minutes to review for you why in the face of significant economic uncertainty and industry and company-specific challenges of generic competition, we believe that we have a number of strategies and assets to help us succeed. Those include first, products with high growth potential; second, diversification in our business platforms; three, opportunities for geographic expansion; four, productivity and cost control initiatives; and last but not least, innovative R&amp;amp;amp;D efforts.    Let me explain in some greater detail. First, our core franchises, Enbrel, Prevnar and our nutritional business, all continue to grow fast and globally. Together, they represented sales of $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 21%.    Year-to-date, the amount of $6.3 billion, that&amp;#039;s 36% of our total revenues and up 22% versus last year.    We believe Enbrel has significant growth yet ahead. And let me illustrate. Between now and 2012, we estimate that the market categories in which Enbrel competes have the potential to expand by another $10 billion of sales.    We expect that this growth will come from earlier and wider usage of biologics in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, in existing geographies and expansion into un-penetrated market.    We expect Enbrel to maintain its number 1 position in the category owing to its unique safety and efficacy profile, established over 16 years now of clinical experience.    Prevnar is also poised to deliver on future strong performance. We continue to really find the potential of Prevnar and vaccines in general. Every quarter, we make progress with Prevnar, including the initiation of more national immunization programs in more and more geographies across various economic levels. We now have reached 28 national immunization programs worldwide.                        1          2          3          4          5          6          7          8          9          10          Next Page                                                                          Other Articles on WYE                                    Earnings Preview: Wyeth  Oct 21, 2008                      Ten Highest Yielding Pharma Stocks  Oct 20, 2008                      Better Choices - Cramer&amp;#039;s Lightning Round (10/15/08)  Oct 16, 2008                                                              Previous WYE Transcript:                                    Wyeth Q2 2008 Earnings Call Transcript
