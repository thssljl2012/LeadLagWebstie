[quote=benlomand;1001589]What happens if an agreement between us and the company can&amp;#039;t be reached? Is arbitration an option?   QUOTE]      That depends on what dispute resolution process is spelled out in your CBA. Impasses do happen and how they are resolved should be included as one of the items in the CBA.      As far as chanign current pay/working conditions, of course they can be changed as part of the process.  It may be worth giving up something to get something with more value.   Can the company go it and ask for a reduction of wages? Sure. Does that mean that it will happen? Not necessarily.      This is a negotiation. A give and take process. Neither Union nor management can unilaterally decide something.        My husband&amp;#039;s last contract was not great. However, union negotiators told them this is the best we are going to get. Sure, we can strike and go to binding arbitration, (as their contract required) but we dont think we will get anything better than what we have.  Soemtimes one part of the TA is great and others not so great. Thats why I say you have to look at the whole package.
