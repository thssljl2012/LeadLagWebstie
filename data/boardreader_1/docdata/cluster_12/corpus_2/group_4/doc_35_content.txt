BANKING giant Barclays is defying the credit crunch by creating 240 new jobs in Liverpool.    The company will recruit 24 account consultants every month for the next 10 months at its Wavertree Technology Park base where it is launching the second of its UK-based Proactive Telephony Centres.    The new full and part-time workers will be in addition to the 1,000 plus people already employed at the site.    Expansion across its retail business sector has resulted in the growth of Barclays Proactive Customer Contact division.    Having spent the last 18 months cultivating this division in the UK at its Sunderland contact centre, the group is looking to replicate its success in Merseyside.    Barclays is also looking to recruit supporting management and leadership positions, ensuring that its 200-plus consultants have the right level of leadership support.    The banks head of premium segments, Alan Longmuir, said: This is a fantastic further investment into the Merseyside economy and provides great confidence in our position as a key and progressive employer in the region.    Ours are not your average contact centres. Our Proactive Contact Centre division has grown rapidly to meet the needs of our customers and clients right across the UK retail banking portfolio  from our personal customers to our local business and premier clients.    We are looking for individuals who can have a great conversation with our customers.           more
