Have used both feastudy and Estate master in my role role as a feasability analyst. Although I don&amp;#039;t foot the bill for the products my preference is for Estate Master as it is a industry standard, has greater support, training and has more features. I use it for relatively large projects so the detail is nessesary but if for smaller developments the feastudy would be fine and is simpler to use for someone starting out.       All the big developers would use Estate Master and many valuers. The likes of St.George Bank would request it for property finance proposal.
