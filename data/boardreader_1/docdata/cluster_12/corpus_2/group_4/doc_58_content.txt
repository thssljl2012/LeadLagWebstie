 For a few years it&amp;#039;s been a well known fact that the Yankee&amp;#039;s baseball operations are losing money. They generate the most revenue, but also pay the most for payroll and revenue sharing payments. Plus, as previously stated, all the operations related to running a successful baseball franchise cost big bucks.  But, don&amp;#039;t shed any tears for the Steinbrenners. The money made by YES more than covers the Yankee organization&amp;#039;s losses (by a lot). The last figure I remember seeing was $150mil profit from YES. This income is not included in their revenueand as such is not subject tothe revenue sharing provision of the CBA. Plus, the value of the Yankees franchise has skyrocketed recently to over $1.3bil (that&amp;#039;s with a B).  The Yanks will also save some money over the next 40 years because the cost of building their stadiumwill be factored in against their revenue sharing bill. They will still, however, bepaying as much or more in revenue sharingdue to theincrease of revenue the new stadium will generate.     http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/profit/32903/
