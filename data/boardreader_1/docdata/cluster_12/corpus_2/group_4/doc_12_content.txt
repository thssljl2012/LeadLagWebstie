Most bank tellers are part-time employeesare so do not receive a large salary. The banks are all standing down staff at the moment due to the economic downturn. If you really want to know their rates of pay and I bet they differ from bank to bank, as you have to sign a workplace contract if you work for a bank, then contact a bank in Australia. Their contact details are on their web sites given below.
