Hello All      In the classic example of release bad news on busy news day, yesterday ABC Learning Centres is reported to have gone into voluntary liquidation.      The age reports       http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au...89-601,00.html        ABC Learning, the childcare centre operator that looks after 100,000 Australian infants and toddlers, is today expected to be swept into receivership after months of escalating financial trouble.      It is understood the board of the debt-laden company will call in administrators, formally killing founder Eddy Groves&amp;#039;s dream of creating a global childcare empire.        This may seem a minor point but it could have major implications for a massive industry and property.      ABC has 25% of all chidren in care, a total of 110,000. If you take each child to equate to only one parent you could have 110,000 struggling to attend work.  The problem escalates where you have single parent familes or dual income.      Also the Fed Gov wants to change the ratio of under 3 care from 5 kids to one carer to 3 to 1. This could force many others to the wall or raise fees.      We could also see nationalisation of child care into essentially government preschools.      Finanically CBA is reported to have massive debt to ABC and there appears ot be nothing left except the building which are worthless if the income fails to cover them.      Please post your comments as it unfolds.      regards      Peter 14.7
