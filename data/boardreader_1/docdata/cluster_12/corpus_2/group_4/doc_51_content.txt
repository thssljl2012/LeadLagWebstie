DISH Network on Wednesday announced a partnership with the Community Broadcasters Association to help prepare consumers who watch TV via over-the-air signals - including low-power stations - for the digital TV transition.      The partnership will involve promotion and sales of DISH&amp;#039;s suite of digital-to-analog converter boxes, with a portion of the proceeds going to the CBA in support of its digital TV transition education efforts.      Consumers with analog TV sets who wish to continue watching both digital high-power stations and analog low-power stations must either subscribe to a pay-TV service or purchase a converter box that has an analog pass-through for those low-power TV signals. DISH&amp;#039;s converter boxes - the TR-40 CRA, DTVPal, DTVPal Plus and the DTVPal DVR - can accept both analog and digital signals.
