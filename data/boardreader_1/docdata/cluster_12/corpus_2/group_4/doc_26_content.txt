 If you go the TTL route, I would recommend changing it on the record   level instead of at the zone level. It&amp;#039;ll only work when the record is   cached though, before the network outage.      How about setting the netbios node type for the remote office to be &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;   type? The clients would fall back to broadcast in case the name   resolution fails via DNS and WINS.      -Ravi    ________________________________    From: ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org   &amp;amp;#91mailto:ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org&amp;amp;#93 On Behalf Of Gabriele   Scolaro   Sent: Monday, November 03, 2008 4:29 PM   To: ActiveDir@mail.activedir.org   Subject: &amp;amp;#91ActiveDir&amp;amp;#93 DNS records TTL      Dear all,      we have some small offices (range 5-30 users) where we did not place a   domain controller for some reasons - primarily because there is no   secure room for a DC (it&amp;#039;s a 2K3 AD, no RODC).    Locally only few servers are installed and mainly function as file/print   server, plus DHCP and DNS &amp;quot;caching only&amp;quot; server that all clients target   to as primary DNS server.      When the WAN link to HUB DCs goes down I saw the Kerberos service   tickets are still valid (kerbtray) so users can access local file shares   and printers (unless they restart the machine or login just after the   WAN outage), but DNS cached records expire very soon in the DNS server   cache (I think default TTL is one hour or so for the entire zone).    Genrally this generally is not a big problem (no connectivity to the   HUB, nothing works, so no DNS worries!), but some users located at some   remote sites that need to access an application server located at that   remote site can&amp;#039;t resolve FQDN host name of those local servers because   the record is expired in the local DNS cache.      Does it make sense to extend the TTL to say 8 hours? Any other   idea/approach? (I would avoid transferring zones to remote sites as   secondary).    I&amp;#039;m conscious that extending TTL will impact name resolution   accuracy/updateness.
