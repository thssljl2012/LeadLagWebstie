 Interesting close today.  Traded in $31.50 to $32 range most of the day then in the match up it jumped $2 to close at $34.00.          I&amp;#039;m assuming looming options expiry is a likely part of the explanation given its been a strong down month.   Also noted that BBP managed to pay off a debt facility announcement at 4:15 p.m (don&amp;#039;t follow BBI so not sure if this was expected).   Also no news today from CNP which might be a case of no news is good news?          Any other possible explanations for the large jump on the close?
