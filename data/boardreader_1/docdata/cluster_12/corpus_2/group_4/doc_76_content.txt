         WHILE most retailers are shedding oceans of tears over customers that have gone missing, Rip Curl Group is managing to keep its head above water during these turbulent times.  The 2008 financial report for the privately held clothing and accessories company has been lobbed with the Australian Securities &amp;amp;amp; Investments Commission, revealing that sales continue to rise, despite the slowdown in the wider retail trading environment.  The company, which counts James Strong and National Australia Bank&amp;#039;s local chief Ahmed Fahour as board members, increased revenue from $390million to $419 million. Although profit fell to $14million, last year&amp;#039;s bottom-line result of $22 million had been substantially boosted by a property sale.  The only sign of stress in the 46-page report was a $1.5 million write-down on the company&amp;#039;s investment in retail stores, which was based on estimated cash flow forecasts in the softening environment.  Rip Curl&amp;#039;s experience seems to be mirroring that of its main competitor in the surf, ski and actionwear space, the listed Billabong. It recently reported a 10 per cent rise in revenue to $1.3 billion.  If only the hapless Globe International, whose shares have slumped after it posted a $24 million annual loss, could get a slice of the action.
