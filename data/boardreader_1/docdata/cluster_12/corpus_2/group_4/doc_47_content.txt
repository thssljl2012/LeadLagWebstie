         NJL  What about the bung that the government has paid to Northern Rock? Not on your list I notice    What about the bung that Barclays paid to the UAE/Qatar? 300 million in &amp;#039;commissions&amp;#039;* apparently. If this were ooh, say, BAE, I expect there would be a state investigation (or not, as Tony Blair might see fit).  * &amp;amp;lt;cough&amp;amp;gt; sorry, I seem to have a bit of Qatar in my throat today
