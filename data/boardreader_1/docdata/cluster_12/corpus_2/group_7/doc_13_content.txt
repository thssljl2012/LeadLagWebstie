Circa the mid 1980s, the habit of corporatising, privatising and floating profitable government departments became widely popular.    For the next two decades it seemed de riguer economic philosophy to divest governments of cash cow earners to obtain one off income and debt reduction.   In Australia this meant the public loss of Australia Post, Qantas Airways, Telstra Telecommunications and the Commonwealth Bank.   Their loss meant not only lost government on-going revenue but also loss of influence/control of the fields they operated in with the subsequent inflationary pressures.      In the current "credit crunch" global economics of cash strapped governments needing stimulatory spending source coffers, how valued would the retention of these business&#039; and their income have been?    How are these business&#039; travelling now in current circumstances and would they or the governments have fared better or worse with their retention?
