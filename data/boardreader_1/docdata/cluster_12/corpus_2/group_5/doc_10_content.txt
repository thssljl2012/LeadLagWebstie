Verizon Wireless awarded $17b Alltel loan Updated:2008/12/12 11:17 Verizon Wireless, the joint venture between Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group, closed a $17 billion syndicated loan, the largest in the US this year. The deal was arranged by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup, according to the Financial Times. It will enable Verizon Wireless to refinance the debt it took on in June when it bought Alltel for $28.1 billion from TPG and Goldman Sachs. At time when household names are going bust left, right and centre through a lack of credit and the US biggest car makers have had to go cap in hand to the state to stay alive, this is a massive vote of confidence in Verizon. A dozen US and foreign financial institutions were involved. There had been fears that the worsening financial conditions would force Verizon to abandon the take-over of Alltel, which was given regulatory permission to proceed by the Federal Trade Commission yesterday, thereby incurring a $500 million break-up fee.
