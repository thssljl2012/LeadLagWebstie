Industry observers are predicting that the marketing drive will fall little short of a brand relaunch for the bank, which has been struggling to maintain momentum in an industry that is in the midst of its darkest hour.    While the economic climate has made consumers more questioning of not only the products on offer but the integrity and stability of financial institutions, Barclays and its credit card arm Barclaycard intend to &#147;make life easier&#148; for its customers.    Speaking exclusively to Marketing Week, Barclays global retail and commercial banking chief marketing officer Libby Chambers outlines how the bank is intent on shaking up its marketing function and the brand at a time when banks are being vilified for their role in the global economic downturn.    She and her team, including UK retail marketing director Dave Jeppesen, will need to defy critics who warn that yet another about-turn could confuse customers instead of cementing the identity it seeks.    One rival financial marketer says: &#147;It is ironic that a bank more than 300 years old, with one of the UK&#146;s most iconic names, should struggle so much to define itself.&#148;    From the Robbie Coltrane-fronted Big campaign of 2000, through Fluent in Finance to Inventive Spirit of 2005, Barclays has lurched from one positioning extreme to another, its advertising often at odds with the business strategy (see box).    Yet one source close to the bank suggests that this is where Chambers comes in and excels. The executive says that Chambers was promoted from Barclaycard chief marketing officer, where she still holds day-to-day responsibility, to her current role in May last year in order to bring consistency and a strategic focus across the division&#146;s global operations.    Chambers herself says: &#147; Because I have spent a lot of time at the top of very big banks, I&#146;m used to seeing the big picture and therefore asking what marketing needs to do. As opposed to a marketing-led agenda, I have a business-led agenda.&#148;    Prior to joining Barclaycard in 2006, the American held posts at Bank of America and spent a decade at management consultancy company McKinsey &amp; Company working for brands including Citibank, American Express and AIG.    Her background is in stark contrast to Barclays&#146; previous chief marketer Jim Hytner who left his role as group brand and UK banking marketing director in 2007. While Hytner brought a wealth of populist marketing experience from his years at broadcasters Five, ITV and BSkyB, he was criticised for being strategy-light with no previous experience of the banking sector. Conversely, prior to Barclaycard, Chambers had no experience of running an advertising team.    She was brought in by fellow American Anthony Jenkins, chief executive of Barclaycard, to galvanise the credit card brand&#146;s marketing operations, which she says had suffered from underinvestment for several years. &#147;He knew he needed a pretty significant change programme across the business and a pretty significant rethink of the management team,&#148; she says. &#147;Marketing had suffered from underinvestment and there was a need to play catch-up &#150; catch-up in product development, branding and online, all of which had been allowed to get dusty and underused.&#148;    One of the biggest changes was a move away from the use of celebrities in campaigns designed to be side-splittingly funny in the vein of the classic Rowan Atkinson ads of the Eighties. In a nod to today&#146;s more austere times, current campaign Glide With Us is more feel-good than funny.
