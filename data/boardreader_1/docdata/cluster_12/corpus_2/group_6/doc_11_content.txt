EVO TAKE &amp;#150; The FT reports that Stephen Hester (RBS CEO) visited Beijing this week where he met Bank of China executives and flagged a possible divestment of its 4.3 per cent stake. This is the equivalent of someone with a huge mortgage and negative equity trying to solve the problem by selling their ipod.    DETAILS &amp;#150; RBS stake in the BOC is worth &amp;pound;2bn, and they bought in 2005 for &amp;pound;800m, so profit on disposal would be &amp;pound;1.2bn. Bulls may argue this is a &amp;#147;catalyst&amp;#148;, we believe this is a distraction to the investment case. RBS raised &amp;pound;27bn of equity last year (of which &amp;pound;15bn courtesy of UK Govt) and the total RBS balance sheet is &amp;pound;1.7 trillion. The announcement follows Bank of America selling 2.5% in China Construction Bank, Li Ka-shing selling part of his charitable foundations BoC stake, and UBS selling its entire 1.3% stake in BoC.    VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION &amp;#150; We believe RBS needs to shrink by a third for it to offer any kind of reasonable investment case. Rec Reduce, TP 18p &amp;#150; the shares are currently just &amp;#147;option value&amp;#148; in our view.
