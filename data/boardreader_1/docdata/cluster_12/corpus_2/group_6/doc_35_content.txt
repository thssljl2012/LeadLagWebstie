 but got distracted by all the stories.  So far all I've got is  Qantas Airways, Telstra Corp., National Australia Bank, Nestle, General Electric, Ford Motors, Citigroup, General Motors Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Applied Materials Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Sony Corp, Applied Materials, Coca-Cola, SanDisk, IBM, Fujitsu and Accenture. They also either have or had the World Bank.  Those are just the names identified in news articles. No comprehensive list has been published so far as I can tell.  The articles said the companies were instructing their lawyers to start reviewing their contracts for exit clauses.  There are three other Indian firms which can pick up some of the slack but many of the articles are saying they cannot satisfy all the potential new clients in the short term.  Cries are starting up for India to bailout Satyum. Too Big To Fail.
