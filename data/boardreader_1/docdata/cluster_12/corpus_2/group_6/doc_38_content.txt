In-house search software specialist Autonomy ended 2008 on a high, enabling it to beat Citigroup&#146;s profit estimates.     Autonomy&#146;s revenues were 2.5% ahead of market consensus, excluding currency headwinds, Citi said, largely as a result of strong demand from companies seeking to ensure they adhere to compliance and regulatory guidelines.     On the basis of Autonomy&#146;s fourth quarter results Citi expects earnings forecasts for 2009 to rise by between 5% and 10%.
