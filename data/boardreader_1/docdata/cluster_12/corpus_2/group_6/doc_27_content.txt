Hi donnerskie      I understand this and while I agree it is not the role of an adviser to time the market, many of the good ones were already advising their clients to move to a more defensive postion early to mid last year.  I did the same with my portfolio around July and avoided most of the fall out - still copped a significant hit though.      The point is that last year most analysts believed that equity and listed property markets were overvalued but many planners did not caution their clients.  I work in the financial sector and I have been coming across quite a few people lately who are close to retirement and have their super invested in high growth assets. Their advisers (the AMP/CBA types) did not advise them to take a more defensive position despite their being close to retirement and despite the consensus on overvalued market.  This must raise the question of what was the value of their payment of 2%  trail (or whatever it is)?
