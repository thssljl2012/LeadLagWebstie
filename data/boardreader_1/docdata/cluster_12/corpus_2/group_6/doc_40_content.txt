I dont think Indian market is that much impacted, Indian banks are still lending because they made record profit. See the results of SBI and ICICI declared this week. These are very bullish. Check SBI third quarter results (sept -Dec) here and compare it with any financial results of the same period Sept to Dec of a US Bank:  http://www.sbi.co.in/downloadfile_2....ase_9MFY09.pdf   This tells the story, India is not much impacted by downturn as they are not exposed to US Mortgages in any ways. This would mean India is not in recession. Only bad thing is the Interest rate in India which if lowered due to falling inflation can bring good things back in a short time.
