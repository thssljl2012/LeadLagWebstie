Barc SP struggled while we waited for the ME deal to go through. It touched a low of 117p, now look at it! I went in to soon on this price but have still taken 22.5% profit from that purchase when I sold at 160p (could have been more if I had more believe that the current rise would continue. If I looked at the trends it said sell and buy back on the drop, I don't think that I could buy at the price I wanted to so cancelled and looked elsewhere. As I said, looking for 10-20% over 30 days or so.    Lloyds tie up with HBOS will get approval, when any doubt is removed the share will stabalise and I believe show a steady improvement.  RBS   LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland is mulling a sale of its 4.3 percent stake in Bank of China as part of a widespread review of its international assets, The Financial Times said on Thursday.   The report said that RBS, now 57 percent owned by the British Government following its bailout last year, had told Bank of China representatives this week about a possible divestment of the 2 billion pound ($2.98 billion) asset acquired in 2005.  An RBS spokeswoman declined to comment.  New Chief Executive Stephen Hester, who replaced the acquisition-hungry Fred Goodwin following the bailout, has said there will be &amp;quot;no sacred cows&amp;quot; as he seeks to overhaul the company, which also owns Citizens in the United States.  Struggling Swiss bank UBS AG said on New Year's Eve it had sold its stake in Bank of China at a discount to institutional investors, while Bank of America on Wednesday sold a 2.5 percent stake in China Construction Bank for just over $2.8 billion.
