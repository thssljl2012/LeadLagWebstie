I did the same with my portfolio around July and avoided most of the fall out - still copped a significant hit though.     The point is that last year most analysts believed that equity and listed property markets were overvalued but many planners did not caution their clients. I work in the financial sector and I have been coming across quite a few people lately who are close to retirement and have their super invested in high growth assets. Their advisers (the AMP/CBA types) did not advise them to take a more defensive position despite their being close to retirement and despite the consensus on overvalued market. This must raise the question of what was the value of their payment of 2% trail (or whatever it is)?                      People have to want to become defensive.  All advisers have to risk profile their clients and judge their tolerance to risk and invest them accordingly.  On every risk profiler questionairre I have ever seen there is always a question as to what negative rate of return you can handle.  Good advisers should always make clients aware of the risks and those who have been in the game a while know that it isn't always happy days.     The standard trail on AMP products is 0.4%     I wonder how many indiustry fund members where warned about the impending doom in the financial sector - oh that's right, none, they don't give advice.
