 Videotron's debt offering last week was the first issue in the North American high yield market in over 2 weeks. JP Morgan, Citibank and BMO were the bookrunners. The size of the offering was originally going to be about $250 million Canadian. But when it did come to market a few days later they upsized it to about $325 million. The effective yield on the bond is just under 10 percent.   The question is why Videotron is doing this raise? Three days before doing this raise, they stated in their MD&amp;A they had no need for any new financing. While this is puzzling, the most puzzling aspect of this is the fact Videotron has a $650 million secured line of credit with over $500 million of it unused. Furthermore the rate on this line of credit is 3.5 percent. So why raise high yield debt at 10 percent when you 3.5 percent facility particularly when you have stated that expansion plans call for only about $300 million over the next three years. It doesn't make sense. It can't even be argued the line of credit is in danger given it was not only just renewed but increased. So it leaves one thing. They are about to spend three or four hundred million on something and don't want to add it to the line of credit because it will use up most of the unused capacity leaving them tapped out going forward. So they have no choice but to go to the high yield market to raise money. So the question is what they are spending the money on?
