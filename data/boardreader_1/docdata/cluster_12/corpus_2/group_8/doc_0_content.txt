"Ratings agency Moody's Investors Service has downgraded to negative the ratings outlook for ANZ Bank, the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac because of the potential impact of the economic downturn."       http://business.theage.com.au/busine...0302-8lzu.html          If their ratings go down, does this mean they will have to accept a lesser rate for bonds??  Any implications for fixed rates here?
