 Something to share.... PM interview at Hua Hin, Thailand...         Qn : re GIC/Citigrp : What's the impact for GIC         PM : No, I'm not discussing GIC today, this issue has been addressed from time to time in Parl; i think recently Mrs Lim Hwee Hua answered qns in Parl from Sylvia Lim n others... n i dont hv an update. The position we have taken, and it's the correct attitude, is that this is long term money invested with a LT perspective, n u hv to take ups and downs, n u hv to look at the overall portfolio, and overall, we've performed well. In a bad year, like last yr, this yr, we probably will see shrinkage, but u hv to take a LT perspective, bcos if u jump up and down and u want to break even or make money every quarter, i think u will not be able to have a sensible policy or a sensible outcome. You will end up not protecting your value, and it will be like buying gold which will do nothing, or putting your money in a safe deposit box, which also will do nothing, and we cannot do that.         Qn : ...what about in the event that Citigroup gets nationalised....         PM : No.... we cannot discuss Citigroup as Citigroup; we hv to look at the whole of the portfolio, and overall what is the performance... (there are)some ups n some downs, some good, some bad, some good years, some bad years, and overall, over 20 years, it has done well and i think in this market, there is no fund which has not (!??!) done well. I mean, u look at all of the university endowments in America - down 20, 25,.. Harvard is abt 30% (down) It is inevitable. If you stay invested, you hv to accept the ups n the downs.         And if you are like Temasek and you are owning Singtel, and SIA, and DBS, and Keppel, and SembCorp, all of these shares hv gone down; the Spore stock market has gone down by half. So if you just add up the losses on these shares alone, you're talking abt S$30 billion or some very considerable sum, so what is the govt to do ? Do you want us to sell off SIA bcos next yr the price is going down, or Singtel? Do you want us to short these companies ? (laughs) Or short the Spore market bcos u think the Spore market is going to go down ? You cant; you have to sit there, these are long term assets, we are looking for long term value. And we hv to keep a LT perspective
