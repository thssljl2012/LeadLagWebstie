  I was watching a speech on the A-Pac channel earlier today, given by Ian Macfarlane, former governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Australia at ASIC. He explained quite succinctly why it was only Canada and Australia, out of all the OECD countries who had managed to come out of the banking crisis so well.      He pointed out that none of the big Australian banks had gone to the government for hand-outs, nor were they going to. They had all retained their  top level A3 credit rating and indeed were now better capitalised than Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank combined. The reason for this was due to the government's ban on mergers between the big four banks (ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac) - the so-called Four Pillars policy. The irony is that the bankers have been whinging about the policy for years claiming it's anti-competitive.      So yes, it's pretty clear that Australia will ride out this global financial storm far better than the UK, where the only bank that hasn't either gone under or required billions of tax payer's money to stabilise them, is HSBC.
