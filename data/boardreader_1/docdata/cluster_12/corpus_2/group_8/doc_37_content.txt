Thats a complete pack of silly wankers.     &gt; Interbrand valued the Telstra brand at $9.7 billion, followed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd at $7.1 billion  &gt; and National Australia Bank Ltd at $5.1 billion.     Those numbers are straight from someone's arse.    You can tell from the smell.     &gt; Westpac came in at number four with a value of $4.8 billion, while ANZ Banking Group Ltd lagged slightly behind its  &gt; main rivals, coming in at number seven with a brand value of $3.1 billion.     Those numbers are straight from someone's arse.    You can tell from the smell.     &gt; Interbrand said Telstra was ranked highest because of its the only telco with "a truly integrated telecommunications  &gt; experience",     Wota packa pig ignorant fools.     &gt; while Commonwealth Bank of Australia beat off its rivals because it has  &gt; "achieved success through its consistency in cross selling and delivering the types of products customers want across  &gt; a range of categories".     Wota packa terminal fuckwits.     &gt; "Telstra and Commonwealth Bank of Australia are great examples of Australian brands that have a strong connection with  &gt; consumers and relevant business offerings," the consultancy said.     Wota packa terminal fuckwits.     &gt; Interbrand said a key criteria for evaluations was the company's  &gt; ability to execute successful strategies during an economic downturn.     Wota packa terminal fuckwits.     &gt; "The ability to create business opportunities in the economic  &gt; turndown is a representation of a strong brand," Interbrand said.     Wota packa terminal fuckwits.     &gt; "Many of the Australian brands featured in the rankings are aggressively seeking to expand away from Australian shores  &gt; into larger and more lucrative overseas markets."     Telstra aint, fuckwit.     &gt; On the list of top twenty Australian brands, Woolworths Ltd ranked as  &gt; the highest retailer, at number four, with a brand value of $4.6 billion, while government-owned Australia Post came  &gt; in at $900 million, number 11 on the list.     Those numbers are straight from someone's arse.    You can tell from the smell.
