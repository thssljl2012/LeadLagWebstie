MAS -- BAM  INA -- PBSI  SIN -- SBA  CHN -- CBA  KOR -- KBA  ....and the list goes on.     The few exceptions are the INA players sponsored by PB Djarum, the few ex-Pelatnas players who have decided to turn independent this year (like Taufik Hidayat), the MAS players sponsored by KLRC (Lee Tsuen Tseng, Sairul Amar Ayob, etc) and the other countries' players sponsored by KLRC (Zhou Mi, Taiwanese and Russian players, Jonas Rasmussen, etc).                      maybe SOMEONE didnt understand what is national player and what is profesional player
