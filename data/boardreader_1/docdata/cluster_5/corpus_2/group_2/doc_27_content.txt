In our case, almost all of the boys are failing almost repeatedly.                                             So many teachers have changed  Once in a while BD passes in a subject that is purely due to opposition dropping their guard. If you are really good you should have won 2 ODIs in a row atleast once against an established country all these years.       2000 - 4 played 4 lost      2001 - 6 played 6 lost      2002 - 14 played 13 lost 1 No result      2003 - 21 played 20 lost 1 No result      2004 - 19 played 16 lost 3 won ( 1 against major nation)      2005 - 14 played 10 lost 4 won ( 1 against major nation)      2006 - 28 played 10 lost 18 won ( 1 against major nation)      2007 - 23 played 15 lost 8 won ( 2 against major nation)      2008 - 19 played 15 lost 4 won ( 0 against major nation)
