CONFIDENT WATSON READY TO ROLL    Wednesday 3 September 2008    Queensland all-rounder Shane Watson will be looking to continue his good one-day form at international level against Bangladesh today.    Watson is fast firming in the critics&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#8482; eyes as the man to replace Andrew Symonds on the upcoming Test tour of India.    A stellar Indian premier League series followed by a standout performance in the one-day series in the West Indies has rocketed Watson back into contention after a string of setbacks through injury.    &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;#039;ve made such amazing inroads with my fitness,&amp;amp;quot; Watson said at a press conference in Darwin on the eve of the game.    &amp;amp;quot;The most important change is that I&amp;#039;m not over-training these days.    &amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#339;I have realised that you don&amp;#039;t lose your talent in a day and I don&amp;#039;t keep training any more just for the sake of it.&amp;amp;quot;     Watson missed the opening game of the three-match Commonwealth Bank series in Darwin due to soreness in a toe that he broke in the Caribbean.    Fellow Queensland all-rounder James Hopes opened with Shaun Marsh in the first match, but could drop down the order to allow Watson to open.    &amp;amp;quot;Shaun&amp;#039;s a great guy, he&amp;#039;s an amazingly talented batsman,&amp;amp;quot; Watson said of impressive left-hander Marsh.    &amp;amp;quot;The first I really saw of him exploding in the seniors, during the IPL I bowled against him in one of the games and it&amp;#039;s some of the best batting I&amp;#039;ve ever bowled to.     &amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#339;He hits the ball harder than I&amp;#039;ve probably seen anyone hit the ball just on normal cricket shots.&amp;amp;quot;     Rather than worry about the competition for places in the ultra strong Australian side, Watson is happier these days to pump up his squad mates.    &amp;amp;quot;I used to (worry) probably three or four years ago - compete myself against other players in the team - but I don&amp;#039;t worry about that anymore,&amp;amp;quot; he said.       http://www.bulls.com.au/default.asp?...  omeNews=True
