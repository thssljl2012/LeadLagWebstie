        Quote (Dwerfs &amp;amp;#064; Wed, Oct 22 2008, 01:12pm)   u lose 3 sockets i think, cba calc     Well if you switch out a 120/60 armor w/ shaft you lose 45 ias but if you switch out circ w/ gaze you only lose 15 ias not to mention you give up some dmg if you switch out armor. I don&amp;#039;t know too much on bowas so correct me if Im wrong.
