 If you&amp;#039;re from UP undergrad but not from CBA or SE, you&amp;#039;d benefit a lot if you&amp;#039;ll go for the UP-MBA.      If you come from UP-CBA undergrad, you&amp;#039;d be very disappointed with the Ateneo MBA. So, if you&amp;#039;re from UP-CBA, aim for AIM or go abroad. That&amp;#039;s what many CBA, SE and Engg grads from UP do.
