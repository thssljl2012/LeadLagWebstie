I managed to see a bangladesh match for the first time since WC, and yet again the boys failed. Other than Tamim , none of the boys really lloked like they can play at the international level. Ash was nervous as hell , and didn&amp;#039;t judge the bounce well.      Tamim, our best batsman today, still seems arrogant to me, with his lack of willingness to take out singles. If he did that today, he wouldn&amp;#039;t have probably not gone for that very stupid today. Greg Chappel was spot on today about his and bangla batsmen.
