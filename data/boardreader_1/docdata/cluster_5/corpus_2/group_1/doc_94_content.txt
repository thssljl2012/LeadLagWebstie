All the other players are new, young and inexperienced, and now trying to find some form.   We have to be realistic and look at the players in the Aussie side,  IMO, no comparison .   They have 3 stars in the likes of Shane Watson, Shaun Marsh, Andrew Symonds who can tear bowlers apart. Also, their bowlers. e.g. Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Bracken and Stuart Clark can do serious damage to any batting side.The weakest link here is the mediocre bowling of the BD bowlers. In 2005, good batting gave the win, also the 2 early wickets, I dont think Mash has the same fire.     All I am hoping for is some competitive cricket from the lads and to fight it out to the end. If they can score over 200 runs and bowl out the Aussies, then they have done well.     I am hoping that one of the batsmen fires tonight, and if 3 of them can score over 50 runs each, then they have done well.     Best of luck to them, but please fans, if they lose, no bashing please. I hate it when everyone comes out and bash these young lads.                                          Sister Zainab how can you forget Mashrafee Murtaza
