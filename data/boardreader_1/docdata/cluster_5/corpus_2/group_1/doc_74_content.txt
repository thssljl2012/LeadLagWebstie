On a different note, the apparently slow pitch might be good news for our slower bowlers!                                          Very good point. I think our fans are getting a little too excited, including myself though, after seeing the Australians struggle against AIS. But it&amp;#039;s this excitement and this hope that keeps us loyal Bangladeshi fans supporting the team through the hard times.      Good luck Tigers! Go Bangladesh!
