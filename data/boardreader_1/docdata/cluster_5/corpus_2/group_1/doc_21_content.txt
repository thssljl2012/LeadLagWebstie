As has been discussed before, when i talk of the top echelon, i mean a very very small proportion of players. How many of those mentioned would you rather have in your ODI side than Ricky Ponting, Mike Hussey or Matthew Hayden? For me, none of them- although Smith, Tendulkar and Sangakarra do have a case, so i&amp;#039;ll give you those.                      Well, given that all three play very different roles within the Australian side, it is hard to say. Obviously different players have strengths that contribute to their worth within the side and those factors are worth contemplating when comparing them to batsmen from other teams, who may have different roles. You can&amp;#039;t make a fair and accurate comparison between Matthew Hayden and Mahendra Singh Dhoni because one is an opener, and one is a middle/lower order bat who keeps wicket too.       When talking about the uppermost echelon of ODI batsmen in the world currently I would be inclined to say that Dhoni is currently the best ODI batsman in the world, closely followed by Sachin Tendulkar. Dhoni led his team to victory in the Commonwealth Bank series, took them to the final of the Asia Cup and is topping the averages for 2008. Obviously his average of 76.20 is boosted by not-outs, but his contribution to India has been invaluable.       There is a whole group of players (about ten) who can lay claim to being among the best ODI batsmen in the world presently, among them Dhoni&amp;#039;s team-mates Gautam Gambhir, Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh. Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting haven&amp;#039;t played much in 2008, otherwise they would be challenging Dhoni strongly for the mantle while others like Sangakkara and Chanderpaul could do likewise. If Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers perform well in the upcoming ODI series their stocks will be boosted heavily.      To answer your question properly, who would I rather have in my team instead of Hayden, Ponting and Hussey? Personally only Ponting would make my current ODI side, if all players were fully fit, and my top seven would look like this.      Gambhir   Tendulkar   Ponting   de Villiers   Chanderpaul   Dhoni
