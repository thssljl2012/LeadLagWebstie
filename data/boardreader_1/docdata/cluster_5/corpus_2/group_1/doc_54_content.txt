 It was great bowling but what happen with batting?    I was watching with my Dad (a great cricket lover and a former cricketer) and we were discussing that if Tamim and Ash got out early it might be a low total for BD. Exactly that happen. Ian Chappel was also mentioning the fact that only Tamim and Ash are the 2 players for BD to do well against major teams.
