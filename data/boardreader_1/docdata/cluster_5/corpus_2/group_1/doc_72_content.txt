the last over by Shahadat is no compensation for wasting the new ball.&amp;#039;  but I&amp;#039;m starting to think he might be a dilhara fernando type bowler who&amp;#039;s more effective with the older ball (first change and death overs). we can go with Mash and Rasel/Nazmul with the new all. I was really impressed with Nazmul&amp;#039;s attitude and concentration despite that horrible last over whicj i partially blame Ashraful for; he talks way too much to bowlers during the over....disrupting their rhythm.  and I&amp;#039;m still mad at Shahadat for not being able to correct his stepping errors.
