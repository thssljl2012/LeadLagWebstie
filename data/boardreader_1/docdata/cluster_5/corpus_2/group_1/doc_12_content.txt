When you said .........&amp;quot;all the optimism has been soaked out of me&amp;quot;. That is your problem not ours. We are fully charged and full of spirit. Your thoughts are not based on facts. After scoring a 50 one may score beteen 0 or 100 or better. How do you know it will be worse not better? Think positive and try to overcome negatives as it comes. Don&amp;#039;t predict negative. It won&amp;#039;t do you any good. Sorry, but that&amp;#039;s how I feel. I hope you don&amp;#039;t take it negatively. Our mission is to win. If we loose we will try next time.
