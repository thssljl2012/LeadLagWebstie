 Cricket Australias National Selection Panel (NSP) today announced a 14-man squad to take part in the three-match Commonwealth Bank Series to be played against Bangladesh in Darwin during late August and early September.      The 14-man squad for the Commonwealth Bank Series is:      State Age   Michael Clarke (c): NSW, 27   Michael Hussey (vc): WA, 33   Nathan Bracken: NSW, 30   Stuart Clark: NSW, 32   Brad Haddin: NSW, 30   Matthew Hayden: QLD, 36   James Hopes: QLD, 29   David Hussey: VIC, 31   Mitchell Johnson: WA, 26   Brett Lee: NSW, 31   Shaun Marsh: WA, 25   Andrew Symonds: QLD, 33   Shane Watson: QLD, 27   Cameron White: VIC, 24      NSP Chairman Andrew Hilditch said:   The Commonwealth Bank Series against Bangladesh is ideal preparation for us with a busy schedule of international cricket over the next 12-18 months. The squad is an exciting mix of our senior players and our young emerging talent which performed so well in the West Indies, Hilditch said.      While it is disappointing not to have Ricky Ponting available we are confident continuing his recovery and missing this series will assure Ricky is ready for the demanding cricket schedule ahead for the Australian team. Matthew Hayden has been selected in this side subject to fitness. His progress has been monitored closely by our physiothe****** and doctor and his overall participation in the series will be determined as we get closer to the date. The NSP has reserved the right to add a 15th player into this squad should this become necessary.      Cricket Australia physiothe****** Alex Kountouris said:   Ricky Ponting is still recovering from wrist surgery and has not been considered for selection for this series. He is making good progress and on track to be available for upcoming cricket. Matthew Hayden is progressing well with his rehabilitation following an achilles tendon injury. His availability for the Commonwealth Bank Series will be determined over the next two weeks.      Australian Team Coach Tim Nielsen said:   This series provides us with an exciting opportunity see our senior players and youth combine in what will be a very important series for us. We are very hopeful of Matthew Hayden being able to rejoin the team and our medical staff will continue to monitor him over the next two weeks, Nielsen said.      The series will also provide a great chance for those in the Top End to see the elite of Australias cricketing talent in action.         No surprises tbh.
