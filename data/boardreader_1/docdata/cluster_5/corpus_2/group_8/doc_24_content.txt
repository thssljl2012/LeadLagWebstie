  Aussie Pride! , International Cricket Captain:Ashes 2006 Edition  by Lonie_from_50           Commonwealth Bank Series - Australia vs India at Melbourne       12 January 2008   Dravid hundred stalls Australian start      A brilliant unbeaten hundred by Indian batsmen Rahul Dravid has got his side over the line after Australia looked to have control. Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson struck Sehwag and Tendulkar respectively, to have the Indians at 2-8, but Gautum Gambhir and Dravid formed a solid partnership.    The run-rate required was increasing more and more despite power plays being used, but the pair took to Cameron White and Stuart Clark later on.
