Just encountered a problem for the Commonwealth Bank Series Finals. It automatically skipped matches, heading straight to the next tour. which is in Pakistan.    I got beaten 3-0 in the Finals, and Ben Hilfenhaus' brilliant series went down hill from their, automatically claiming selection and taking 2-215  , bringing his ODI average to a rank 24.75 instead of under 15.    It also seams I am stuck with the 15 man squad I had for the Series for the Pakistan tour
