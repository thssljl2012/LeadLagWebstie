     Quote:                          "One of the worst attacks in recent memory"     Simpson blasts Australian bowling attack    Cricinfo staff   9 June 2009             Former Australian batsman and national coach Bob Simpson has launched a scathing attack on the current Australian attack, labelling it the "worst in recent memory."      After the announcement of the squad which included Brett Lee, Shaun Tait, Stuart Clark, Shane Watson and Ben Hilfenhaus, Simpson made the stinging claim in Melbourne newspaper The Herald Sun.      "To me, this attack has never been worse. Its one of the worst attacks we've had in recent memory. Unfortunately, since the loss of (Glenn) McGrath and (Shane) Warne, only Stuart Clark has stood up as test quality, while Shaun Tait has shown glimpes," Simpson wrote.      "Tim Nielsen (Australian coach) hasn't got enough development out of the players, which is why he was selected as coach, to get more out of your Taits, your Johnsons and your Cullens. You compare this to Dav Whatmore who has done very well with the England attack and made players like Stuart Broad and Jon Lewis into quality one day players.      "Bringing MacGill in wasn't the right option. The selectors needed to have the confidence in the spinners they have tried in the last couple of years, but yet again they went with the old timers. Australia rely on their batsman way too much as it is, and I don't think MacGill, as good a bowler as he's been for his career, can change that."      Simpson has been very critical of Australia in the past, saying the Aussies needed to go harder to get Dav Whatmore as coach, and in particular, was very much against the various techniques employed by former coach John Buchanan in terms of fielding and bowling.      In 2007, Simpson was criticised by captain Ricky Ponting over his criticism on the 'poor management and coaching' of the Australian cricket side which resulted in a torn bicep to all-rounder Andrew Symonds in the Commonwealth Bank Series. "Bob needs to get with the times," Ponting said. "He was a great coach, but unfortunately he needs to notice that there is more importance in fielding now than there was in the early nineties."      Australia play their second warm up match tomorrow at Taunton against Somerset before their one day international against Ireland in Dublin and then their opening Twenty20 match against England.
