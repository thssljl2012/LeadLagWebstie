                    Re: CBT Round 10 Results                                             I must say that it disturbs me to see this thread at the top of the list because what immediately comes to mind each time is NOT the Commonwealth Bank Trophy.      What does come to mind is 10th on  this  list! Ok, I'm a sick puppy.
