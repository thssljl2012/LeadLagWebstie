Katich and Matthew Hayden helped get Australia off to a determined start on the third day of the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar series against India.Resuming on 50 without loss in pursuit of India's mammoth first innings score of 613 for seven declared, Hayden and Katich put on 123 runs for the first wicket - their best stand in the series so far.Katich, however, departed just before lunch, falling to leg-spinner Amit Mishra for 64 as Australia reached 151 for one at lunch with Hayden (59) and captain Ricky Ponting (14) at the crease with Australia 462 runs adrift.Hayden, 16 overnight, had survived a torrid first over from left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan before finding some of his old touch.Zaheer had knocked the burly left-hand batman on the helmet with a bouncer with the first delivery of the day, went past the outside edgewith his second and hit Hayden on the shoulder with another bouncer before the batsman put bat to ball.Katich had looked far more comfortable, using his feet nicely to the spinners and easily dealing with the pacemen.He brought up his half-century with a push off Anil Kumble to mid-on for a single, but fell while to rookie Mishra shortly after as he stepped down the track to work the ball away on the on-side,but missed the delivery and was bowled through the gate.Hayden, who has struggled on this tour so far, reached his half-century with a classy cover-driven boundary off Ishant Sharma.
