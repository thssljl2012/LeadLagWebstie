   THE rise of New South Wales allrounder Moises Henriques has been rewarded with a rushed call-up to join Australia for the rest of its Commonwealth Bank one-day international series in Darwin. Henriques, who captained the Australian Institute of Sport to an impressive practice series win over Bangladesh, replaces troubled Australian cult hero Andrew Symonds.The Australian team's leadership group sent Symonds home after he missed a compulsory team meeting to go fishing on Friday.Henriques, impressive with both bat and ball against the Tigers last week, is the first Portuguese-born cricketer to be called up to an Australian team. His selection was a matter of being in the right place at the right time with Australia A on tour in India.Cricket Australia National Selection Panel (NSP) chairman Andrew Hilditch said the decision was taken to minimise impact on Australia A in the 'unlikely' circumstance that the replacement player would be needed. 'The NSP thought it was an ideal opportunity to reward Moises for an outstanding stint at the Cricket Australia Centre of Excellence and Emerging Players Tournament,' Hilditch said.
