A superb spell from South Africa skipper Johan Botha kept his side within striking distance after Australia opener David Warner earlier blasted his maiden one-day international half-century in the third Commonwealth Bank Series clash at the SCG.  Having won the toss and elected to bat, Australia appeared on course for a total in excess of 300, but a steady flow of wickets saw the hosts bowled out for a respectable 269 in the final over.  Things looked promising for the home side early on as Warner plundered 69 from just 60 deliveries, as he and Shaun Marsh (43) combined for 114 at the top of the innings.  With both openers removed, Ricky Ponting (29) and Mike Hussey (12) set about continuing the onslaught but a mix-up between the wickets sent Hussey back to the pavilion sparking a mini-collapse.  Botha, who took three for 32 off his 10 overs, was the destroyer, drawing false strokes from Ponting and Brad Haddin (six) in quick succession to haul his side back into the contest.  David Hussey (36) and James Hopes (33) steadied the innings with a valuable 51-run stand but the loss of Hussey again halted the hosts' progress at a pivotal point in the innings.  Proteas pacemen Dale Steyn (two for 47) and Makhaya Ntini (two for 46) ensured the momentum stayed with the visitors in the final overs.
