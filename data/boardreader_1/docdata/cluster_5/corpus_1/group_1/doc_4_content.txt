 Fast bowler Brett Lee withdraws from Australia squad for ODI series against Bangladesh  Fast bowler Brett Lee has withdrawn from the Australia squad for the upcoming one-day series against Bangladesh 'for family reasons'. The 31-year-old has been confirmed as a high-profile absentee from the training camp in Coolum and will not join his international team-mates as they travel to Darwin ahead of the opening match of the series next Saturday. Cricket Australia's acting chief executive Michael Brown said Lee had been given short-term leave from international duty because of 'a family issue' following a lengthy liason with the national selection panel. 'This results in Tasmanian Brett Geeves coming into the national squad to cover for Brett Lee during the Commonwealth Bank Series against Bangladesh in Darwin,' Brown explained. 'The selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the Australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for Brett Geeves to join the Australian group for the first time. 'We look forward to Brett Lee rejoining the group as soon as possible.' It remains unclear whether Lee, who is regarded as a significant threat with both bat and ball, will return for the second or third matches of the series, which are both also being held in the Northern Territory city.
