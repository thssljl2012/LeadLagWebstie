The Bush Administration, and now the Obama Administration have determined, rightly or wrongly, that Citi is "too big to fail". So in essence, it has already been nationalized.  They don't need to put up new signs reading "Taxpayers Bank" for it to mean that the government pretty much owns them.  The U.S. taxpayer is on the hook for $45 billion and Citibank has a $12 billion market cap.    Same goes for AIG in the insurance realm, taxpayers have dumped over $150 billion into a company with a market cap of just over $1 billion.    And don't get me started on the car companies.         Ron, you've made a convincing point here. I was thinking mainly in terms of common stock ownership.  I'd like to discuss this further, perhaps this evening- right now I'm in the midst of something and don't have time though.  rx
