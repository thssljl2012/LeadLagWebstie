 There was a class action suit brought against those crooks at Big, Bad Bank of America for overcharging people on debit overdraft fees.  They lost and were ordered to pay $35m, but admitted no wrongdoing.  They continue their wrongdoing, however, and will do so as long as no one objects.  I say, object.   Let them know that you are aware of the judgment (below) and that you will take action if the fees are not waived.  These banks are out of control.  The settlement was out of CA, but I think the ruling applies here, too.  I dont know if they will call your bluff, but it doesnt cost anything to try.     http://www.clossonsettlement.com  /   The lawsuit claims Bank of America made statements in its advertising, website, and customer agreements to encourage its customers to use Bank of America debit cards and increased the number of insufficient funds fees, overdraft fees, returned check fees, and similar fees charged to customers using Bank of America debit cards through the order in which such transactions were posted and the account balance information it provided. The lawsuit also claims that Bank of America authorizes debit card transactions that will result in overdraft fees; fails to warn customers that specific debit card transactions may result in overdrawn accounts; posts debit card and other transactions in high-to-low order; and provides account balance information to customers that is not current, accurate or as advertised. In addition, the lawsuit claims that Bank of Americas customer agreements are unconscionable, and that Bank of America does not provide customers with copies of account agreements until after they open their accounts.
