What about the TRILLION (did you see the word TRILLION) we're spending on the stimulus package directly as a result of the housing debacle???? Do you agree that a TRILLION is 'more' than 18 billion? Is it the Poland Spring drinking water up there buddy?                            Fannie &amp; Freddie did get political favors as do many private companies, lets not forget they are private companies, nothing new in that politcal game. What many forget is that the financial institutions (FI) like Bank of America - Citi Bank-Merrill Lynch-AIG etc. are just as much at fault. They have legal limitations based on their assets as to how much money they can lend. So to skirt these legalities, once they reached their asset base and can't loan anymore money they sold these motgages back to Fannie &amp; Freddie. Which in turn gives the (FI) more money to purchase more mortages to sell back to Fannie &amp; Freddie and then in turn allowed Fannie &amp; Freddie to borrow more money. And so the cicrle went unbroken merrily chugging along making them all wealthy...at least on paper.   Which in my previous post is why I stated that anyone should be able to buy a house that can afford it. So all these FI's were getting rich along with their shareholders and just like you and I knowing that sooner or later housing would go bust and people would default on these loans. And yet none of them decided to face reality and get off the merry-go-round. And despite what's happened some still haven't faced reality and keep throwing lavish parties so I say it's all about the money and plain old greed.     Yeah I'm concerned about 18 billion in bonus money being paid out to people who don't deserve it. That's a big reason, business practice wise, why we got in this mess and another point in my greed observation.     Poland Spring water is not spring water but comes from artisian wells.  It's owned by Nestles now so who knows what's in it       As far as bail-out money, I say screw 'em all let 'em all fold and have the works crash and burn and see what rises out of the ashes if anything.  But I'm in the minority and have to sit back and have another brew...  So I'll let you guys solve the financial crisis and get back to me.
