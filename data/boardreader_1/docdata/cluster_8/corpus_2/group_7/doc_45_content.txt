 Thanks everyone for your time, did you mean wardrobe or what goes in it.      I'd prefer the "what goes in it" bit!!!      By urbanisation I didn't mean where you have to pay a yearly fee for maintenance etc., I just meant legal, although it appears that if the house was built many years ago it probably wasn't in the first place.    Trust me to want something awkward! 23 years ago I bought an agricultural property, try getting a mortgage on that easily, the banks didn't want to know, I had to go to the bank of America!   I am a farmer..I had 1 sheep for 10 years and went off lamb for about 20!
