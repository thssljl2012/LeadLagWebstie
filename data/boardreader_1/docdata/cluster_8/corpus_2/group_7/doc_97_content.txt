Though we are not joint on his account, it's not like he don't share his money.  He do.  He transfer it to our other accounts.      In a way, I think he's scared to add me to his bank account where his main earnings go through because 1) I might leave him one day or 2) cheat on him.       Shit happens all the time.  Be cautious.                       thats not very optimistic.
