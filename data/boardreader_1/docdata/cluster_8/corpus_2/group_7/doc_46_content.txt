         "I think it's actually safe to assume that Berkshire will be able to produce above average growth in float just by virtue of being the strongest insurer during turbulent times."   I don't think that growth in float will come from auto insurance.I watch TV and the auto insurance ads are numerous each claiming they can save you money. As of 2007,according to the link below, Geico was fourth behind StateFarm, AllState, and Progressive. I suppose Buffett could become the really cheap auto insurance guy to gain temporary market share but that is not his style. If the easy profits arent' there he would probably move on to some other float generator. Whatever insurance businesses AIG had seem like they would be vulnerable to us now. I just don't see WEB getting involved in any kind of auto insurance price war, although he could probably outspend them all.  He likes the low hanging fruit.   http://www.iii.org/media/facts/statsbyissue/auto/
