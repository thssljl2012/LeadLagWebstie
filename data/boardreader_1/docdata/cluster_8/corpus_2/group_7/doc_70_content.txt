My Citibank Dividend went from 8.9% to 16.9% -- yep almost doubled! It doesn't affect me because I pay the stupid thing off every month, but I still called and told them that Citibank is shameful for doing this to people that are struggling right now. They lowered it back down to 11%. If I didn't *make* a few hundred every year from the % back I'd close the account.      Sleazy bastards.      BTW I believe most banks let you reject the APR increase, but then the account will expire when your card expires, so basically you keep your lower rate but will have to pay it off soon.
