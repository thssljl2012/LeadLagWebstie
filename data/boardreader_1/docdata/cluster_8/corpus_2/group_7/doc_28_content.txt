  It was forced by the government housing programs going back many years. It placed unrealistic requirements on banks to loan to otherwise unworthy buyers. The deal snowballed into a greed fest over the years as they gave money away to anybody until the bottom fell out.  you sir are the winner...these sub-slime loans were marketable for one reason only and thatbeing backed by the full faith and credit of the US taxpayer...it wasn`t that long ago when a borrower was required to place 5% down and their mortage note not to exceed 30% of monthly income....nowadays home loan requirements have gonedown to car loans....without getting political,, there`s one party in DC responsible for all this....  PS--- there`s still the other shoe to drop...So don`t look up..sad, very sad     Wrong again. Sure, risky loans were issued, but only with the intention that they would be sold andrepackaged as an AAA rated mortgage to another company. That, and it encouraged foreigninvestment in the 'Citibank' realestate fund. youthoughyou were investing in a fund that was going to produce sick returns but in reality it was a fraud.  bear Stearns, Citi, BOA..they all knew these peopel werentgoign to payback
