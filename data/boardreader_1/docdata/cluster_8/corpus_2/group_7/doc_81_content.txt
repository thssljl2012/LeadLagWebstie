The world is far   &gt; more complex than the simplistic paranoia displayed here.          The right wing will often cite this carnard to prove ther eis no there there, but wht they failt o see is that interests of Empire are not aigned with the state, but with the inetersts of the ruling elite.   Exxon is till reporting record profits in spite of the downturn.  If demand were dictating profits, they would have been similarly affected.   &gt; And if there truly was an empire here, wouldn't it be great if that   &gt; empire could somehow manage to just steal the wealth it needs, rather   &gt; than go further into debt?          If there was not an empire, the US woudln't have 700 military bases in more than 100 countries around the world. Those bases aren't there to feed the hungry.  Again, you assume the the tinterests of the empire are aligned with those of the public.  Clearly they are not.   Furthermore, the consensus in Washington put forward by the right is that becasue of our dollar hegemony, we can manatain a permanent deficit.   &gt; Perhaps we should be taxing all the other   &gt; locations in this mythical "empire" to pay for the debts here in the   &gt; home country.  If only there were such an empire!          We have been, by enforcing tghe petro dollar as the standard currncy for oil.  So long as the world needs US dollars to trade oil, none of them have been forced to cash in their reserves.  Meanwhile, we've been printing money without any regard for the day of reckoning.   Also, as part of our pact with the Saudis, they are required to keep their profits in US banks.  It is estimated the Saudis have 2-3 trillion in US bank, which also acts as a giatn credit card for the US.  If you don't believe we're an empire, see what happens when the Saudis try to withdraw that money.   &gt; EDIT:  Which by the way is just the opposite side of believing that   &gt; giving people the opportunity to vote after removing a murderous   &gt; dictator will somehow mean that they will vote the way you want them   &gt; to or even want anything to do with you.  Political delusions occupy   &gt; both sides of the political spectrum, obviously.          Good point.  That is why the US has been arm wrestling with the Iraqi government about the SOFA agreement ermitting the SU to remain in Iraq.
