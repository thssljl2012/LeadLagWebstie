 beej...hear hear....   they would probably be surprised to learn that even low doc loans are still available....and this time CBA has them at the same rate as an ordinary standard variable rate....not a higher rate as most had them before this fiasco.....   the abs stats when I last bothered to look had the average home loan around 240,000...at current rates of 5% thats only 12,000 pa interest cost....or about 250 pw....almost everyone can afford that amount for a roof over their heads   Must admit I buckled under the weight of the 10% interest rates last year....but beginning to feel its time to come out and do some spending....if only to assist some people to stay in jobs....and the bargains that are out they ...almost unbelievable....so have been buying up for family and friends...the only thing I want...is probably a new car....there is nothing I need.....might buy a laptop for some of the family too....with wireless broadband now they dont need the additional cost of a telephone...landline to hook up...most are on mobiles only   cheers
