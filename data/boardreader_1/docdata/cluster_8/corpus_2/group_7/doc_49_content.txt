The Washington Post isnt the only newsprint in trouble. I just read an article on financialsense.com concerning the New York Post. I enjoyed the end:      In closing, it is appropriate to bring The New York Times&#8217; op-ed columnist, Maureen Dowd, into the picture. She recently savaged executives from A.I.G., Bank of America, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and the U.S. automakers; deeming them to be incompetent, self-serving charlatans. In this January 28, 2009 op-ed piece titled Wall Street&#8217;s Socialist Jet-Setters, she calls these executives "boobs," "dumb," "obtuse," and "&#8230;careless ghouls who murdered the economy." So Ms. Dowd, what do you think of the executives who "murdered" The New York Times Company&#8217;s balance sheet? What names would you like to call them?       Shall we bring on the shackles? Shall we bring on the show trials?       http://www.financialsense.com/editor...2009/0225.html
