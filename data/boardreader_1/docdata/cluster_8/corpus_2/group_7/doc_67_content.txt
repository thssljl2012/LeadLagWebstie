I've read some of his writings, but I have never heard the man speak. I think he's had a long time to polish his delivery in order to play off any sort of self interest.      All financial institutions have something to gain in the tax codes, but his made a specialty in selling insurance products in order to avoid paying estate taxes. The estate tax is making a comeback at 45%, starting at an estate of $3.5MM. That's going to create the liquidation of a lot of small businesses and family farms if they don't take up Mr. Buffet's company, or like companies, on their estate planning products. What else could those companies do with the premiums otherwise paid to those companies? Perhaps grow their businesses? Employ more people?
