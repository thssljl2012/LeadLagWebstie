  Let me add just one other thing about the whole "I would never be on personal assistance because I plan ahead" argument. Let me tell you - NOBODY planned on this. No one plans on being in the wrong place at the wrong time. No one goes to work for a home improvement store that pays benefits KNOWING that they will be laying off 7000 workers the next week.    If Iexpected to sacrifice my family, my time, my health, my home, and my families savings rather than taking some form of government assistance, I wouldn't be making those sacrifices out of a sense of personal responsibility. It would be out of pride, pure and simple. My aunt used to say that she was too proud to speak with her mother after she remarried. She died never having spoken a word to her since her wedding. Ah, but at least she had her  pride ....    Do you think Exxon refuses subsidies and tax breaks because they are too PROUD? Do you think corporations don't take advantage of tax loopholes because they are too proud? Do you think GE or Citibank is too proud? The people going to congress and asking for money are some of the richest in the US. They know what side their bread is buttered on, though. They know that it is better to get help for a while than make the painful decisions that would result if they didn't. If US law looks at corporations as individuals, then why do we forgive these companies for doing everything they can to survive, and getting help wherever they can get it, but we hold individual workers, or unemployed workers, to a higher standard?
