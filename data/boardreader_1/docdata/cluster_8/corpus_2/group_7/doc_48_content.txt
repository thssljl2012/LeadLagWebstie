         I have had a Motley Fool credit card since 2003. Unfortunately, at some point Bank of America bought out the original issuer [can't remember their name]. I have always paid on this card on time, and at the moment have a balance of 2k that I have been paying down, with a credit limit of 17,500 and a credit score of 800. The other day I logged on to check my visa and found out that my limit was dropped to $2700 without even telling me. I did question Bank of America who said 'you will get a letter'. I had heard that this would be happening in early 2009 and I guess what I heard was correct. It amazes me that Mr. Lewis can testify on capital hill that BofA is extending credit and 'helping' the consumer, when they are pulling this nonsense. I also am wondering IF The Motley Fool wishes to have their Logo on this credit card anymore? Surely the Fool community cannot agree with this type of action.
