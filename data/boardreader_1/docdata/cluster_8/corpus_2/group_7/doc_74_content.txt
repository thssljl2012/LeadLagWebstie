 NFLD Message Board Posts          Recs: 3              Spend it wisely   You must nationalize the big banks.  Can't trust Chase, Citi, or Wells or US Bank to spend it the way intended.    That will give a better chance that any future bailouts be spent appropriately.    The one thing that did create a buzz was the $15,000 credit to all buyers and  it figures the ass clowns cut it to $8,000 to first timers. They did that in order to keep the total bill under 800 billion.    A liitle difference in total spent(30 billion)  vs  a big difference in psychological thinking.    We need the 15,000 credit to help clear this housing inventory.    If Obama was serious about cleaning this shit up, he would get the top thousand forensic accountants in this country with experience in bank examinations and unleash the lot of em.  We would find out that the big banks are broke and should be closed down.  All current shareholders burden the loss and the tax payer back the deposit side, only.    The remaining funds the government throws at this should be spread out and not all given to the banks.  We already saw what the banks will do. They will do it again if they are given the opportunity.    Stress test for banks? More like planting the seed for the next TARP  How many billions do these asswholes have to lose before the American public wakes up?    Me no likey
