In the US transferring money from one US bank to another constitutes ID.  I just did this to start an ING savings account.  Maybe it's the same in Canada? If so you can start a new account somewhere  else easily.    I mail a Bank Of New York check (money order) from KEB. Maybe they   have a Canadian version.
