       Quote:                         Maybe someone can show me that a poor person is a worse driver? Unlikely.                     Rich or poor has nothing to do with driving habits.  Now, if you take credit into account, you will find a direct coorelation, like it or not.  California doesn't use credit, but I can see the benefit of doing so.     P&amp;C agents tend to get bonuses for profitability.  The fastest way to lose profitability is to write policies at used car lots that provide loans to those who probably shouldn't be trusted with a loan (i.e., several repos already).  I lost my shirt on this for a while.     Finally figured out that personal responsibility tends to transcend all parts of a persons life, whether it's credit or driving.  Many rich people have bad credit and are bad drivers.  Many poor people are excellent drivers and have good credit.     I know if you look at single individuals, this doesn't necessarily track, but if you look at several, it does.     Sort of like why does an auto insurance company care if you got a speeding ticket (which they don't pay)?  It's shown that this raises the odds significantly of an accident that they will have to pay.     Why do they raise your rates if you get into an accident?  Not to pay for the accident you had (they have to pay that regardless), but the odds of you getting into another accident are much higher!     Dan
