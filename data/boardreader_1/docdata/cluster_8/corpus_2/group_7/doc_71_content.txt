          Shortly after Marquette was decided, North Dakota pretty much repealed its usury statutes.   Well, I know that they're both fly-over states, and people get North and South confused.  But seriously, if an attorney is going to blog something on the internet that cites court cases, s/he should at least do enough research to cite the state that was the first to loosen the usury regulations correctly.  It was  South  Dakota!  That's why Citibank has large processing centers in Sioux Falls,  South  Dakota.  Here's an article from  Bankrate.com  (which obviously checks it's facts a bit better):  http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/20020320a.asp    A funny thing happened after the Marquette ruling. Major credit card companies began relocating to states with liberal or no usury laws. New York-based powerhouse Citibank moved its credit card business to South Dakota in 1981.   "Citibank went to South Dakota, not because South Dakota was a banking center but because it had that particular law," Donovan says. In 1982, the four largest banks in Maryland relocated their credit card operations to Delaware because of that state's lender-friendly credit card laws. Other states with lender-friendly credit laws include Georgia, Illinois, Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island and Utah.   AJ
