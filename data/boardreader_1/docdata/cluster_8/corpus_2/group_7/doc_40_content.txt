President Hussein Obama is right to impose cap on financial executives who failed the American people and used their investment as gambling tool, losing tens of trillion dollars of long time savings of American seniors.  CEOs of the failed banks like Citibank that was led by tax cheat Tim Geithner and insurance companies like AIG should pay 2/3 of the $500,000 on Federal, State, and Local, Medicare, social security and other taxes and take home about $167,000 annually.  The historic idea that CEOs are smarter that the average American and deserve to get home 100 times of the normal American salary because he is a financial genius proved to be wrong and baseless. Clearly, the recent financial meltdown crisis proved once and for all that the average CEO is a total financial failure and avid gambling loser who wastes the money of the hard working Americans.  The immediate result of the Marxist president Hussein initiative will be that executives will leave the failed big banks like Citibank to work in small and prosperous private banks, letting the large Government ruled banks like Citibank and insurance companies like AIG to collapse and disappear.
