It just seems like you start with the proposition that things are somehow the Democrats fault and then try and figure out how it is their fault.  I admit the reverse is my knee-jerk postion, but I try and back away and let the facts speak for themselves.  Maybe I am wrong and you are totally unbiased, but it doesn't come across that way.                      No one is completely unbiased. I try to be honest and fair. In this instance I find democrats guilty at the inception and both parties guilty later on.

In the end, we got on with our work, and it had little impact.      Ultimately, a merger is so complex (even the smaller ones) it will face multiple delays for multiple reasons. The delays may even cost millions, but, if you are dealing with a company the size of Citibank it doesn't really matter.                     When your a small bank you're product is selling money or accepting deposits, losing millions is a big deal. That's exactly why community groups went after them during an acquisition or a merger. It was cheaper for them to negotiate their lending criteria than it was to stand up to groups like ACORN who would threaten to end the banks plans and create a publicity nightmare.
