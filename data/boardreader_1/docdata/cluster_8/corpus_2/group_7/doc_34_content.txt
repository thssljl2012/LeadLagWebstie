GM plans are so good Geithner decides to give them oodles and oddles of extra dosh to make them all better again? or....er.......Bank of America and Citigroup realise they're not insolvent after all? what else......oh, they'll think of something before the close tomorrow. Gives them nearly 23 hours.
