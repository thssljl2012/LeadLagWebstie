The credit limit is "sky high" on that one.   I have a small account at Bank of America into which my SS checks and some of my paychecks from a part time job get deposited.   Usually the bulk of this money is transferred over to our joint account at a very financially solvent local credit union.   I also have two small Bank of America credit cards that run very small balances, less than $200 if at all.    As a practical matter, what happens?   Does Citibank shut down our credit?  I know my BofA account is Federally-insured, so do I just do my banking as usual?  What about my BofA Visa cards?    I don't mean to sound ignorant, but I remember tales from my grandparents of "bank failures" where they lost everything that was in the bank.    I'm just not sure how these "Federal bank takeovers" work.                      Obama is the Messiah.  He'll take care of your money!
