The stock is sinking for many reasons but anyone who has accounts other than stock is safe up to $250,000 so a run is not necessary. That money is safe. All people do by taking deposits out is to make the situation worse if that's even possible. I have no crystal ball and am crushed financially by the slash in dividends but at these low prices selling isn't possible. All one can hope for is that someone out there will realize that bailing out banks doesn't hurt the tax payer and in fact by making conditions such that investors are protected at least their dividends are is in the long run helping the tax payer and the economy. If we get dividends we pay taxes on them so we contribute rather than suck them dry. Now when it comes to the greedy, miserable creatures who caused this disaster they need to pay big time. Capping their pay at $500,000 won't solve the problem They should be required to begin to pay back some of the money they basically stole from us. Someone needs to pay for the Merrill Lynch disaster and it should absolutely not be the investors who made it possible for Ken Lewis and his band of "merry men" to do what they did. We need to be part of the protected class. We need to have our dividends restored by March to the 64 cents. I know it won't happen but it would be one way of increasing investor confidence, thereby having stock prices rise, etc. The TARP should require that we the investors be protected not the greedy. Today BAC announced they are selling some of their fleet of planes. Oh how thoughtful of them. How dare they continue on this path. That is what happens when you leave greedy people unregulated people who live in a world so removed from the rest of us that they just don't ever get it. These fools probably believe they are making a sacrifice. Oh no!!!!  Where is my plane? What do you mean I need to book a flight on Continental? What does that mean? I can't take everything on board? Go through TSA? How will I ever manage. Well if this makes you ill Mr. Lewis you can always use Thaine's $37.000 toilet and throw your trash in his $1,500 waste basket. He might have to drive himself somewhere sometime. Let me know when he hits the road so I can stay off----he most likely hasn't had to drive himself in a very long time. I hear they have drivers Ed in case it becomes necessary. In the mean time all investors should writle their senators, congressmen and the President letting them know that we the investors are the backbone of banks and we spend  on Main St. and pay taxes.  I just wasted what little energy I have left after watching my future and in fact my presant vanish.       &gt;&gt;&gt;      Nan. I am sorry for your situation. Your post is excellent and obviously sincere. Please read my post about the etf with the other poster. UYG  is the ticker. You can sleep better when you have a basket at this level than a single issue and you WILL be able to recooperate even if BAC went under. The best to you and God bless you.
