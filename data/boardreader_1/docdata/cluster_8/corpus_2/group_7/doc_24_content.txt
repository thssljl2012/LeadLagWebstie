 This new homeowner bailout doesn't look like it will help much.     http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?...EK_k&amp;refer=home       Only about 50 percent to 60 percent of securitized prime jumbo or Alt-A loans meet the loan-modification standards  requiring borrowers to live in mortgaged properties and owe no more than Fannie and Freddies loan limits, according to a report yesterday by Bank of America strategists including  Akiva Dickstein  and  Vipul Jain .  The  refinancing  plan will be limited by a standard  preventing homeowners from qualifying if they owe more than 105 percent of their homes value , they said.     Borrowers who do not qualify due to loan size can of course still have their loans modified by their servicers, but without the government incentives, the New York-based analysts wrote.  The refinancing plan does little to help underwater borrowers,  they added.
