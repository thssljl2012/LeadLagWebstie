If you own a home you may be able to add it as umbrella coverage on your homeowners policy.      Generally, you might want to have a policy if you add a home to protect it.  People are sue happy now a days.       Great example Dwight:  "If you are out and about shooting and your flash explodes and damages someone's eye and they sue"     There are a million things that can go wrong.  "You turn to quick and your bracket clips some chick in the face and cuts her open".  You'd be responsible for her medical bills, up-to and including her plastic surgery to get rid of the scar.  You never know.  Insurance is there to protect your "ASS"ets.  If you have a lot of money or a house/homes... you need to CYA.                      Thanks for the explanations. I will ask my employer about it and take it from there
