Got this email today. And yes, I know it's spam, but it missed my spam filter, and it had my current bank's name on it, so I read it, and had a good laugh. Then I sent a copy to BofA. his message is to officially inform you that we received a telegraphic wire transfer of $450,090.00 from the United States Government disbursement account as your compensatory grant for the current economic hardship. Please be aware that this compensatory grant has been deposited into an escrow account at the paying branch office in Alabama and is available for remittance immediately. The standard payment procedure is as follows:- The funds will be wired into any bank account of your choice by the payment secretary and the time frame for delivery is 24-48 hrs. It is mandatory that you activate the escrow account by making a one-time payment of $500.00 via the western union money transfer or money gram to enable the wire transfer function of the escrow account.
