Buy lots of P6 mags? Lots of AR mags?  Buy Playboy (nice house too, how about that for a Sigforum gathering?)  Buy Citibank and fire the executives  Buy the Yankees an dissolve the team (MUAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH)  Buy Kevin some pants so he doesn't get cold posting  Buy a Lear, fly to see Screamingcockatoo, have him cook me one of his specialties, then leave the jet for him. (fair trade right?)     - Life is hard, being stupid doesn't help.  You don't need enough ammo to start a war, just enough to end it.  The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has limits. - Albert Einstein
