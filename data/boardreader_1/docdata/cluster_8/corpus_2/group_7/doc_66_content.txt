The more government in our lives the less control we have over our own lives. Who do you think can spend your money better ? You or the government ?     Wall Street can!! The Pentagon can!! Citibank can!! Madoff can!! GM can!! Mortgage Bankers can!! Hedge fund managers can!!  See, all we have to do is get government out of the way and these private sector institutions and their brilliant managers really, really know how to spend our money. As a matter of fact---- they spent it all!
