           Hope this doesn't seem to off the wall, but I am at a loss here.   I am trying to order online, ie amazon ect. My husband said they used to have a invoice feature which allows a bank transfer payment but don't seem to anymore. So far I have only been able to order online using my US bank card which carries the Visa logo.   Do you know any tricks to ordering online with a german bank account?  Thanks a bunch  Edit: I am trying to use amazon uk, rather than de.
