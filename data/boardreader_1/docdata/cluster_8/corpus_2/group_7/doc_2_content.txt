    America is white wrote:     &lt;quoted text&gt; __________ "the bank MADE be buy a $400k house" Get real...lol the payment on a 400,000$ home is more than you earn...no bank in America will make a loan where the payments are more than you earn...and when has banks had the authority to MAKE US citizens do anything that they are not willing to do?     Not so fast there Dessy...Obama has been using examples of folks that took out not only one mortgage, but two, to buy a house. One at a subprime rate and one at 12%. 12%? geez, this all happened within the last five years. My mortgage is 10 years old and I have a fixed rate of 7%. The lender, according to the borrowers, assured them they could refinance at a lower rate later. Now, these folks have two mortgages totaling about 300k in principal and they are not able to make the payments, which was something they knew when they signed the loan...  Now, why should I, knowing how much I could afford, and only borrow that amount, put up money to help them, when they knew that they could not afford what they were buying? Only in America can you screw up and it is somebodyelse's fault.
