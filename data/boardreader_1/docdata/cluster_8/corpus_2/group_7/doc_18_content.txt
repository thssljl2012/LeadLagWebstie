           Quoting  KirkSeattle  ( Reply 3 ):  I'd recommend looking at the back of your card and see what networks are displayed. On my VISA Debit Card from Wells Fargo, it has the PLUS logo, STAR logo and INTERLINK logo. Even if you have a regular ATM Card (with no VISA or MasterCard logo) there should be some logo's on the back. CIRRUS is another common one.      I've had no problems getting cash around Europe, Canada and South America.      I'd also recommend calling your bank to let them know what countries you are travelling to so when they see the withdrawals so far from your home, they won't shut your card off for fraud.            I just got back about a month ago from living in okinawa for 2 years. like KirkSeattle said match those little extra logos on the back of your cards to ones on the machines and they should work. I found that about 1/2 of the atm's there had an english option with instructions.       Also Calling your bank to let them know your going to be there is a great idea bank of america shut off my cards over suspected fraud.       I never had a problem with using my VISA cards there, American express was used in less places but still some accepted it.
