 Short version of link.  Huffington post found Norm Coleman, Sen of Minn was heavily promoted by many, including Bank of America, after they had received federal bailout money.     BOA  hosted a conference call in which the HD founder made said comments.  Again AFTER they received bailout money.      The biggest part of the EFCA, card check, is a bad bad idea.  Votes for unionization should never be publicly known.  The increased penalties for intimidation (as long as applied to both sides), I dont have a problem with.
