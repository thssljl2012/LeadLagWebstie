Why is Geithner the pick when he has been part of the Bernanke - Paulson bailout of Wall street banks that went ahead and used the money to buy other banks instead of loaning the money to businesses and conumers.      When is the money going to go to small business and bailout the consumer and mortgagees which it wa supposed to do in the first place.    And Citibaqnk and Bank of America are still paying bonuses !!!!!! BRAK.    Better yet, the employees are angry that the bonuses were not good enough and are suing Thain,      this is nuts. they got themselves and millions of investors into this mess.    They should go to jail -not get bonuses.
