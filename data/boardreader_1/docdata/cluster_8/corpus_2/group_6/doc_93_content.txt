 We bank with Westpac and OH is self employed just writes out invoices for his boss who puts wages in bank account.  We obviously have to sort tax etc out at end of year.  We are thinking of looking to buy in next 2-3 months but will of been here 6 months in total.  Will we be able to provide bank statements as proof of earnings and deposit?
