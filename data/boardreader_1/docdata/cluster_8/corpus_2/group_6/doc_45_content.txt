Every month there is a section devoted to all the lawyers that got smacked by the Bar for various misdeeds. The Florida Bar is quite active in prosecuting shysters...but WTF would you know about that? Victimize the victims? I have NO idea how you got that idea into your head, since nothing of the sort was in my posts.     Well I DO know about the regulation of attorneys and yes a handful do get admonished and disbarred every year - usually for a felony. But that's not the point here.  There is no regulation yet to limit the legal costs incurred by hospitals. That's the point.  I also agree with your premise that Insurers over charge, spend wastefully. They often avoid paying legitimate claims but when faced with a suit they can win, will choose (usually based on legal advice) to settle for outrageous claims under $100,000 rather than fight them. The reason they don't fight is because of the unregulated legal costs. Its circuitous but the winners are always the lawyers and the losers are always the consumers.  Nothing can be done to help the healthcare crisis until the excessive legal costs associated with insurance are reduced substantially nationwide.   Perhaps the first step to reforming health care is to disqualify lawyers from holding public office or lobbying.
