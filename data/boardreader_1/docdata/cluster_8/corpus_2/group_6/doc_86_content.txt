I also factored in payments at 12% and we continue to make payments as if the rates are at 12% (and then we add some more) so we should have it cleared in a few years.      The broker was telling us to buy buy buy investment properties and leverage them up and go to non bank lenders yada yada yada.   I am always a bit risk averse so insisted on a bank lender, one of the big'ns, and just for our residence and look - 15mths later - market crashed and non bank lenders all but disappeared.      We have a line of credit (current rate 6.09%) I will convert to a mortgage when the building is finished.  If its ever finished.
