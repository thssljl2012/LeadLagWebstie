         &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It is possible that private reverse mortgages could be recourse loans, not non-recourse loans.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, teach me; what is a "private" mortgage? I am very familiar with the HECM product, offered, e.g. by Wells Fargo, MetLife and Bank of America( and probably others?)...By "private" do you mean by a private individual, like a family member? These banks are offering both fixed and variable rate RMs. Life tenure. ...............As I understand it, if you take the fixed rate you must take the entire approved amount in a lump sum up front, rather than a certain up front amount and a line of credit for the remainder, which is an option on the variable rate loan........I know not why. Does anyone?.....tia
