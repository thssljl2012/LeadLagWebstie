They're not stupid.  It's the sense of entitlement we need to combat.  Their whole career is spent around people like themselves, people who can't imagine life without a 10 million a year bonus.  Their kids go to the same schools, they play golf at the same country clubs.  It's a pretty insulated community.    Shouldn't be a big surprise they're slow to get the hint, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't head slap any of them who don't get clue.
