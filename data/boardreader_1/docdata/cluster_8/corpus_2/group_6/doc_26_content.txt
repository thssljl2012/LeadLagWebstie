  WTF!!!!!!!!!!        BofA makes a bad business decision(s) and now we gotta pay.  I hated BofA before, I loath them now.      Wasn't the CEO of Goldman Sachs begging the president of BofA for help just before it collapsed?  Guess BofA doesn't have to beg anyone the government just gives them a blank check.
