Ok, I will "allow" you this,   HOWEVER, what was your opinion when AIG Execs went on that "vacation" after they got their "stimulus"?  It was WIDELY reported, however what was NOT REPORTED was that the execs that went on "vacation" were in the INSURANCE portion of AIG, not the HOUSING portion. The INSURANCE portion was still profitable and their vacation was paid for two years BEFORE the collapse.

That type of persona doesn't fly coach as I normally do. There simply aren't enough first class seats to go around.            Straw-Man......the AIRLINES would have (I'm sure) gladly put on the extra planes and sell the extra seats necessary to get these mooks to DC       Quote:                Originally Posted by  GAPrincess            I honestly don't recall this being in the media two years ago.

She does not need a 757.             It WASN'T widespread published in the MSM.       Quote:                Originally Posted by  GAPrincess            I agree. However, I wouldn't be surprised if he had no idea how many private jets flew in for the inauguration. I'm sure someone on his staff knew but didn't consider it important enough to mention.            Bush didn't need to know how many jets flew in, neither did his staff, and they probably didn't keep records. THOSE records would have been kept by the local airports.

Oh wait......they ONLY care about the use of fossil-fuels if it ISN'T THEM using it, they only care about it if it is the 'little people" using it.
