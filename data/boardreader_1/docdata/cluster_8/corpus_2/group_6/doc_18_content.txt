Canned Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain's spending spree included $1,200 trash bin    By CAITLIN MILLAT and LARRY McSHANE   DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER        Saturday, January 24th 2009,  4:00 AM          There's something a little trashy about a $1,200 wastebasket.    For  Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain ,  an outrageously expensive trash can &#8212; which was part of a $1 million  office decorating spree &#8212; got him canned by his new bosses at  Bank of America .    For  East Side antique store assistant Maxim Makushim, tossing some trash  into a pricey parchment wastebasket Friday was just good, dirty fun.    "It's  more fun to throw stuff in the expensive one," Makushim confessed after  the Daily News arranged a trash toss test &#8212; providing a $14.99  wastebasket for comparison purposes.    Makushim was on the job at  John Norwood Antiques, where the 16-inch-high contemporary parchment  waste can is priced at $1,200. That's practically a bargain. More  opulent versions of the fine leather item list for $3,750.    He acknowledged the cans were not exactly priced to move, even at a store catering to money-is-no-object designers.    "No  one buys the trash cans," he said, recalling just a single sale in the  past year. "Usually, our customers don't flinch at spending thousands  of dollars for things like this. But there aren't any benefits. It's  purely aesthetic."    And yet ... Makushim acknowledged it was  somehow better tossing his trash into the high-end can, with its  checkered design, than the round, brown plastic model brought in from  Bed, Bath and Beyond .    Makushim  has no plans to repeat his extravagant inner trash-toss in the future.  The luxury trash cans aren't much good in the kitchen, the bathroom or  the TV room, he said.    "These are only good for paper," he said. "I wouldn't risk it for any other kind of trash. You would ruin it."    And  he didn't enjoy the full Thain experience: The ousted executive flanked  his $1,400 office trash can with an $87,000 area rug, a $25,000  mahogany table and $28,000 worth of curtains.    Then again, Makushim still had a job Friday.         http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/01/24/2009-01-24_canned_merrill_lynch_ceo_john_thains_spe.html            thread start
