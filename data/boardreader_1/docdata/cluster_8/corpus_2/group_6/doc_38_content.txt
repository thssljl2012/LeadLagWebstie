They are white (occasionally Asian) and wear suits and ties on Wall Street.  Given the choice of a country filled with phony hip hop "gangsters" like BIG and Tupac, who of course would just murder each other anyway, then I'll sign on for the BIGs every time.  All these a-holes running Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman-Sachs, AIG, Merrill-Lynch, Lehman, Morgan-Stanley, and so forth, who have robbed our country of trillions of dollars, THEY are the ones who should be ceaselessly hounded, vilified, and prosecuted by law enforcement officials.      Not that the average thug living on Butthole Street deserves any sympathy, but we've got to see the forest through the trees.  The self-enriching cheats and charlatans who do by far the biggest violence to all our lives is the government and corporate elite.
