    Bank of America   Chase   Citi   Am Exp   Have all taken TARP money. So you have given these Crooks your tax money theyspent it on new jets, office remodeling and trips for there fellow crooks.   To thank you they are raising your rates, lowering your limits and charging you fees you did not agree to.      Isn't Corporate America a wonderful bunch of Slime balls................      Don't get mad get even. When you receive a prepaid envelope from one of these companies send it back with a picture of your dog or ex. They then have to pay the postage and someone has to process the envelope, it costs them money and if enough people do this it costs them a lot of money.   You can also file a complaint at FTC.gov. if enough people complain they will do an investigation of the company.    You can complain or take action, its your choice.   The guy who got his office remodeled repaid the money. I think he might have actually gotten fired as well. Your slimeball comment still stands as true for the majority though.
