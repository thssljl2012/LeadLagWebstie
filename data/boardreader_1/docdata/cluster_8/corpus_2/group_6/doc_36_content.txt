Quite correct.  A common method for crooks to alter cheques is to create a cheque that appears to come from a US bank that clears through one Federal Reserve Bank, but use an ABA routing number for a bank that clears through a different Federal Reserve Bank.  Basically, the check can bounce back and forth for a few weeks before it gets caught.
