A big part of the reason for the lack of any improvement is Congress throwing money at the problems they created, hoping they will go away. The real world doesn't work that way, of course. The housing issue isn't one that CAN be resolved the way you suggest... because banks can't just go back to running banks the way you should. They didn't create the problem with the housing mess... they were forced to create it by laws that require they not apply market standards in lending.... Those laws still require them to make bad loans if they make loans... so, the problem is not fixed... The banks who will survive are those who were smart enough to read the writing on the wall as it was written... and basically quit the business of making loans when the rules required making bad loans. Wells Fargo. U.S. Bank. That is the entire list as far as I can tell... Congress doing what Democrats and some Republicans wanted was and is the problem... and Congress just got worse in the last election... since the voters took it out on the wrong people... given the media failure to report the facts. I agree that tends to mean things aren't likely to improve until after the next election... by which time the voters should have it figured out and be pissed off... but, I'm holding out some little bit of hope still for a random bit of luck that comes paired by accident with "change"... that will get some other things back on track. Housing will simply cease to be a relevant part of the economy until the banking problems are fixed to bring the law into line with market reality... and the more it shrinks the less it will matter over time... which is the other path out of the debacle... to just have other sectors of the economy outlast the Congressional imposition of failure in housing... until houses are sold without inflated demand driven by fake loans, for cash only... and the rest of the economy adjusts to that new reality.
