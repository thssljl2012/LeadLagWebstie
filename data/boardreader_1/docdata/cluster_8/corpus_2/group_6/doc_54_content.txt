I work for Europe Card Services at Bank of America (the world's biggest bank and you've probably never heard of it!)  I'm taking a full years Maternity and 27 days holiday before hand.  I'm not too sure what hours I'll be working when I return as I will have to see how we are financially.  Ideally I'll go back part time maybe about 20 hrs a week and OH's Mum has already offered to look after the baby.  I'd also like her to go to nursery a couple of mornings/afternoons a week so that she can be around other babies. _________________
