Good Luck.                      Excellent advice..Nothing beats 'face-to-face' interaction.You'd be amazed what can happen in a few minutes if you are sitting across a desk from a banker.. Recently I got a bill from my bank with a $150 charge for renewal of a line-of-credit...with a zero balance. The gentleman listened to my tale of woe,which included my option of cancelling the line altogether. ...excused himself for about two minutes..returned and told me the charge had been cancelled and my line of credit had been doubled. LOL        NOTHING is gonna be resolved by talking to some hindu in calcutta on the phone...     just my .02
