what I meant by "higher risk" was startup or established businesses that are vetted by investment outfits.  Not handing money to random people who dont qualify for a home loan or are buying houses with ridiculously overinflated "values".  The western economy is built on the backs of entrepreneurs, small businesspeople, and their dedicated labour forces.  Might be nice to invest in them for a change. (with responsible, well thought out incentives, tax breaks, and loans)
