 Well I should have picked up that 150 shares of ESI at $96-$97, but I was being to greedy in trying to get the shares close to $95. ESI is now at $102 and a 5% gain. Just a nice missed opportunity there, but I'll have to play it safe in this market where the news is bad everyday, especially that new one with Bank of America trying to grab more tax payer funds.
