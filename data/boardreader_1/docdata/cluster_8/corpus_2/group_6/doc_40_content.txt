         I know this has probably been asked a million times before, but my search of the forums was not succesful...SO,  What are your preferences for accessing money in Bali. I do not use credit cards, and have the option of cash or trying to access my savings account there. I have accounts with the Commonwealth Bank, and ANZ.   Commonwelth charges $5.00 = 2% of withdrawal. Not too bad if I can take a lot out at once. I have heard that travellers cheques are hard to change.   Cheers.
