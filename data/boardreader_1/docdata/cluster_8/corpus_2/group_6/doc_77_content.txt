dugg for trolling Libertarians (as I am one myself). As it's been said before, had the government not  bailed out the banks in 1917 and we'd still be on a gold standard, shiz like the credit/housing/automotive boom &amp; bust would have been non-issues. The Freddies would have been kept in check due to market watchdogs calling 'em out instead of getting hush money, and we'd all be in credit unions anyway so the corporate jets would be a quick vote :) Gotta give Obama a thumbs-up for at least keeping 'em accountable with our money.  You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one...
