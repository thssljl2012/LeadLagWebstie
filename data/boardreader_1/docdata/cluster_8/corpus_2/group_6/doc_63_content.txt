          From where I sit, Bush pardoned the Boards of Citibank, Merrill Lynch ... [etc]   Maybe, but really that story is yet to be told.  Remember how his justice department got raked over the coals for their inaction over Enron?  Turned out that the wheels and cogs of justice were grinding along just fine, thank you very much, and in the end all of those principles got their desserts?  Bush will never get credit for bringing Wall Street to justice, if it happens, but that isn't the point.  If nothing happens then either Obama is as complicit as Bush, or there are no criminals to chase.
