The broker was telling us to buy buy buy investment properties and leverage them up and go to non bank lenders yada yada yada.   I am always a bit risk averse so insisted on a bank lender, one of the big'ns, and just for our residence and look - 15mths later - market crashed and non bank lenders all but disappeared.      We have a line of credit (current rate 6.09%) I will convert to a mortgage when the building is finished.  If its ever finished.                        I wouldn't bother converting it as you will be struggling to do any better than that deal you have there.      The Cba deal is probably the best advertised deal around atm I am currently refinancing some loans and scored 5.9 variable from St George ..... they trumped the best CBA and NAB could offer. I currently have a mortgage with them already and they didn't want me to take my business next door to the CBA.      Back on topic now great place you have there matey I looked at moving to the Maroochy area a few years ago and wanted something like that up there. Wife can't stand the heat though.      cheers
