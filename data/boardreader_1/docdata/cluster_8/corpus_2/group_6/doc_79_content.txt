  It's unlikely it will LOSE its value, I said that- but will it outperfom equity instruments like dividend bearing stocks over the next 4-8 years? Hardly likely. Once the dust settles, people will be kicking themselves for not buying Citibank at 2.00 a share when its book value is over 7.   In 99.9% of scenarios I'd agree with you. But you are asking me to trust the viability of a vastly corrupt market, run by vastly corrupt individuals who got us in this mess to begin with and who are allegedly going to get us out. I have faith in history and myself, not the govt. Are YOU willing to trust a Treasury who can't even "remember" to pay his taxes?
