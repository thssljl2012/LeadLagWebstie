Is the individual who handles your finances an authorized signer on your bank accounts?  What written arrangements do you have with this person?  After they &amp;quot;spent the money instead of paying the loan,&amp;quot; will you be pressing charges against them?  With your law degree, I'm sure you know if you had a contract with this person, a fiduciary duty was broken, or a crime was committed.      2.  If BOA cited the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) in this specific situation, they are mistaken.  TILA covers disclosure of credit costs.  Fair Credit Reporting Act would be more applicable, but its purpose is to protect consumers from incorrect or stale credit information.  I would bet it's BOA's internal policy to report 30+ day late payments to the credit bureaus consistently, though.      3.  This is not a service issue, it's a contractual one.  You are not disputing the fact that the payment was not made as contracted - there's not much more to discuss with the bank.      4.  A $65K auto loan is nothing, even for a small bank.  The bank typically has to share its interest income with the auto dealer, shaving their margin.  Data shows that loans rarely stay on the books until they mature - cars get sold, repo'd, and loans refinanced.  These loans come and go and banks really don't care.      5.  A credit card account that has repaid $200K as agreed within the grace period over a period of years is, similarly, not worth much to the card issuing bank.  In your case, BOA only makes a small interchange fees (probably less than 1%) and whatever annual fee you pay, since you pay no interest.  This is peanuts to them, or any bank.      5.  I really hope you were being facetious when mentioning the bailout in this context.   In any case, I'm guessing your area of law practice won't be in business, finance, contracts, or criminal...
