Nice try, but any true libertarian would have been against the bailouts.  We knew they would be wasted taxpayer money, but Dems and Repubs both pushed it through.  Libertarians like to see taxpayers' money returned to them so they can spend it according to their own interests rather than having some government officials decide how it should be spent.
