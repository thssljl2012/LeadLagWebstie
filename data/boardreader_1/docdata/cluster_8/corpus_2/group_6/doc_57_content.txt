           Personally, I never had any issues with BMO Mosaik, even when calling them when the card was lost. I just pay the bill with a US$ check from a US bank at a BMO kiosk without any issues. Works for me.      I'd doubt there would be any issues with opening a PO Box at a US Post Office, but I could only imagine you'd run into difficulties if you tried to do it online. Though I'll warn you, in my experiences, Canada Post's offices and outlets look like a well-oiled machine compared to the USPS'.       And a Visa Check Card is basically a credit card without credit. It works like a Visa and is accepted anywhere that a Visa is, but it immediately debits your checking account when you make a purchase.      Oh, and I'll finally add, watch out for minimum deposits while opening an account. Many branches may not even deal with "foreign" currency, give you bad exchanges or place ridiculous holds on your "foreign" cheques, bringing some US$ cash with you can smooth things a lot.
