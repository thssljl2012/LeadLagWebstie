But this attitude that something is owed to employees of an organization is a big reason why the economy is in the mess it's in.... Too much pay for too little production.  That's true in the financial industry, real estate industry, auto industry and the government.                      Exactly right, and it will only get worse for everyone, including the Colts and other NFL teams. ESPN ran an article several months ago about how some proposed tax laws will affect the NFL in several years. I'm sure this will be a big concern of the owners in the CBA negotiations. Add to the mix the number of fans that will cut out buying tickets as a way to trim their budget, and there is less $ to go around. Not that my heart bleeds for these millionaires, but I'm just saying that its only the beginning.
