We applaud conservation for our enviorment, and national resorces, maybe it's time we start to reward those who can conserve our tax money and the limited rights of the goverment.                      Rumor I've read is that AIG holds all of the insurance and pensions for Congress and gov't employees...      this would explain why Bear and Lehman were told to go fuck themselves and AIG is getting billions anytime they hold out a hand.
