Sadly GM looks like they won't last the next few weeks that is history in the making.... things don't look good AIG is loosing $1 Billion a DAY and if they fold there will be no shipping no planes flying their shares went from $100+ to 35C down from 43 yesterday and still need bailing out.   Krudds bail out won't work and any one getting into Gold should be on a winner.   Any one playing with CFD's the Dow is going down and worth a sell.   Citibank is on its death bed  here is a chance to make money.   Any one wanting to chat about CFD's give me a call???? a good way to make money sitting at home.   Gold 1000+K this week??????
