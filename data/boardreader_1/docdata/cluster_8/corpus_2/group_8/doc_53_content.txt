 Edited on Mon Mar-02-09 10:58 AM by alcibiades_mystery         These losses stem from promises to backstop various mortgage backed securities. As soon as lehman went down, the contracts started being called. AIG kept no cash reserves for this type of insurance (as they are required to keep for other insurance contracts), since credit default swaps were unregulated. They were basically selling their positive credit rating for fees, thinking that the insurance contracts themselves would never possibly be called. Ooops.
