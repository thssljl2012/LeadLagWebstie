Many economists think these efforts will fall on their faces, or worse, get traction at exactly the wrong time and make matters worse.  If you look at Bank of America, Citicorp, and AIG, the government has already invested far more in those companies than the companies are worth -- actually several times the value of the shareholders' holdings.  Yes, the bailouts are keeping the doors open for those firms, but they are also driving private capital out and private capital is the long-range solution for those companies...if there is a long-term future for them.      There's always a tendency in tough economic times to think we've hit the bottom when things get bad.  However, many economists think the economy is only   beginning   to get bad, and that the final bottom will be  much  lower and have  much  greater impact than where we are today.        If that happens, you could have DVC contracts either selling far below where they are today...or being virtually unsellable (if there is such a word).      *****   ETA:  From a macroeconomic standpoint, this may be about the worst time you could possibly buy something like DVC.  Disney's prices are at an all-time high, but the economic picture is very bleak.  That's not a good prescription.        As an example, I bought SSR in 2005 at a bargain-basement promotional price of $83.  It's selling for considerably less than that now, and I'm sure will go much lower.      The economic environment is only one consideration for the prospective buyer, but it's certainly ugly right now, and I think it's going to get uglier.
