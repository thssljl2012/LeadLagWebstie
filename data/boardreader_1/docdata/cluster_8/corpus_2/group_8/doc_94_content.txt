[quote="Metaphorical"]Wa lau kan ni nia! You all got see paper or not? Citibank make alot money jan &amp; feb! Their share price shoot high up like hot sperm!        Tamasek &amp; gic got buy their shares, now make alot money already![/quote]                don't talk cock.. GIC converted for the common shares at US$3.25.. so still 45% loss.        I last night had conference calls with US financials analysts.. the banks will make profit in 1st quarter because they make $ from their derivatives hedging of illiquid exposures..         but after that they will report losses again for the next 3 quarters again.. this time because of loan losses from consumer and business defaults.        so this rally has legs until mid April when the banks report results.. but after that short the market again!
