We can then get other people to give you money, you'll use it to buy more silver and issue more shares -- each share would be backed by silver but can never be converted to silver! What a wonderful idea!      I'll be so rich, but poor you, stuck with all the silver, I'll be the one with all the pieces of paper.                       Hey, I think you are on to something there.  Someone has to get stuck with that horrible, heavy, archaic metal....  and pass on those nice new promissory notes with pretty colors and fancy designs.  I have always been a sucker when it comes to deals like this, so I will volunteer to take in that nasty metal in whatever form it happens to be presented...  and lock it away so that it is no longer a menace to the world.  You know, I might even need to expand this to yellow metals.  It sounds like you have a good handle on this and understand the burden that this task could be.  Perhaps you could work with me to expand operations around the world?
