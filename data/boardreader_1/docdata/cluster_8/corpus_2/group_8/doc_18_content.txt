Can you please tell us why you constantly defend this company when it continues to go lower into an abyss?      Does someone have pictures on you or what?                      Stock Value does not indicate long term survivability.  I am not defending BAC, I am trying expose more of the picture.  The news is only negative and using words like insolvent, is not accurate.  They have not failed or indicated any of their payments obligations.  Yes BAC is hurting, like all financial institutions and many many other companies.  So let's see how thier first quarter is.  You say lower in the abyss, what makes you say this, do you have information no one else has?  They made thier $402MM dividend payment, they don't want more money.  No one forced them to take on Countrywide, but that may be paying off,  Merrill, I don't know, lots of sketchiness there.  I really have no idea, what will happen, if I did, well, I would need to worry would I?  They could fail easily enough, but they aren't citi right now.  So again, I think we just need to give a bit of time to the situation and let some of these companies work out of it.  2009 will be bad, no doubt, it will be bad for Charlotte.  But hopefully we can survive and come our a tighter ship and catch up.
