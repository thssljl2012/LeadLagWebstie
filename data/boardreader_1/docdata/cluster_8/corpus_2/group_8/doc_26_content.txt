The carriers I work with have very little, if any, exposure to the subprime mess.  Most of the conservative ones remain profitable and stable.  No, most carriers have not lost their reserves.  They would be unable to accept new business unless they maintained cash reserves equal to or in excess of the new business.  And let me assure you, business is booming.    AIG's (mis)Management brought on their decline.  It's AIG's re-insurance business that has cost them plenty.  I've heard, but cannot confirm, that AIG is also somehow involved in insuring the retirement accounts of members of the US Congress.  Not saying that would have any bearing on Congress' actions.    I won't say that AIG's demise won't bring down other carriers, but it's quite a stretch to say that most other carriers will fold along with them.  I work with several carriers of significant size, primarily in annuities, and have been repeatedly assured they remain solvent and are positioned to pick up the pieces if/when AIG implodes.
