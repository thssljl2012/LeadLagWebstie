                   She is actually getting a promotion in the next few months.  She will be Director of Compliance, which comes with a nice raise.  I don't know how much but I am assuming it is pretty good.  Her boss came into her office and told her she was going to be promoted.  Might be done next week, might be in July, her boss is trying to get it through HR now but the might make her wait until her year end review in July.      Her division actually turned a profit the last 4 quarters.  She does travel insurance, insurance to students, medical reimbursement programs, dismemberment benefits, accidental death.  90% of is it sold under a different name then AIG.      The problem with AIG was not the insurance, it was the credit default swaps, and mortgage defaults.  I have been reading up on them and still can't figure them out.  For all of their loses they don't really pay any money.  They had a 60 billion lose this quarter but they didn't pay anyone.  It is all on paper, money never changes hands.                                              __________________       "Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk.
