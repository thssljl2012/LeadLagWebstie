Hell, people were bitching about Oil execs bonuses when gas was $4.00/gallon.  Nobody would point out that if all the CEOs made NOTHING, it would have only affected gas prices by pennies, if that.                      I'm receptive to that idea, but I'd rather force companies to do business here by taxing them if they don't but still want to sell here.  I care more about middle class jobs than hungry millionaires.         Sandy Weil got a $200m bonus from Citibank and we are now bailing them out.  Rubin also got hundreds of millions over recent years.  I don't agree those numbers are tiny; we paid double for that - as shareholders and now as taxpayers.  Boards rarely represent stockholders (we saw Merrill's recent tricks of getting a bonus before BOA acquired them using tax money).        Oil prices are set by a market, so we wouldn't have real savings as buyers no matter what the executives were compensated.  I imagine thousands of people got sizeable bonuses, not just the top few.  Investors, however, get more when bonuses are lower.
