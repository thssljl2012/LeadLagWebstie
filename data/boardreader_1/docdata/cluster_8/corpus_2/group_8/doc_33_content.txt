          http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/business/economy/03sorkin....     The Case for Saving A.I.G., by A.I.G.  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN New York Times, March 2, 2009  Inside the corridors of power in Washington, a 21-page document has been getting a lot of attention. It is marked confidential and titled A.I.G.: Is the Risk Systemic?  The report, prepared for regulators by the American International Group, examines the economic apocalypse that would follow if A.I.G. failed....  In the United States, A.I.G. has more than 375 million policies with a face value of $19 trillion.  If policyholders lost faith in A.I.G. and rushed to cash in their policies all at once,  the entire insurance industry could falter.   A run on the bank in the life and retirement business would have sweeping impacts across the economy in the U.S., according to the A.I.G. document. In countries around the world with higher savings rates than in the U.S., the failure of insurance companies would be a catastrophe.  Even though A.I.G.s insurance business is regulated by states, there probably would not be enough money to pay out to consumers from whats known as a guarantee fund. Other regulated insurance companies, which have been weakened by credit losses, would be required to pay money into the fund to cover the shortfall, weakening them further and in some cases bankrupting them.   Some would have to sell more and more of the bonds in their portfolios to honor their obligations to the scared-off policyholders. And  that would freeze up the bond markets again , because life insurance companies to a very great extent are the bond markets. They buy more corporate debt than any other institutions....    The rest of the article analyzes the government's deal with AIG.  But this snip helps explain why the government continues to pump money into AIG's black hole. If they let AIG fail, the entire insurance industry could fail.  Wendy
