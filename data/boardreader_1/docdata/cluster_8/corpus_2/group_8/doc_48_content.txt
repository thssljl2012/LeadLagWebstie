This is about to get UGLY - CtW Investment Group Calls on Bank of America Board to Remove Lewis or Face Ouster Vote         Posiedon, I just don't get you guys.  How bad does a CEO have to lie, cheat and/or screw up before it is bad enough to call for his head?           This attitude is endemic of what is wrong with both corporate America and our legislative branch.  Most people think like you, and I will choose not to characterize that particular behavior/belief pattern at this point.         Why do your think that there is so much corruption and waste in government and so many MASSIVE losses on the back of unthinkable risk taking by Corporate America?           I'll tell you why  ... because besides having the deck stacked in their favor where they win BIG and you (the shareholder/voter) lose, they all know that once they get in, most of the sheepole will say the same kind of ridiculous crap that you are saying right now making excuses for some CLEARLY HORRIBLE DECISIONS and that they will NEVER GET THROWN OUT or PROSECUTED!!!!         So, get off the cross, we need the wood.  The only drama is the drama that KEN LEWIS created when he made all of these DISASTEROUS ACQUISITIONS!!!         Bank of America is supposed to be a boring bank with stable earnings and a stable dividend.  THIS IS NOT A DAMN HEDGE FUND.  IT IS CERTAINLY NOT KEN LEWIS"S HEDGE FUND, BUT HE SURE HAS TREATED IT THAT WAY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS ALL GOT SCREWED BY HIS POOR DECISIONS AND DISHONEST BEHAVIOR (like lying about the Merrill Bonuses and keeping the Merrill Losses from shareholders prior to the vote).         Wake up.         Harley         :)         thread start
