Someone on here suggested getting it wired to my US bank account. If IRS wants some of it it's not worth bringing over here might as well just sit in UK..Rate of exchange is bloody awful right now as well.                        Wait until the US dollar turns into Fiat currency.  Or better yet, buy British pounds now as the rate of exchange is low.  When the Amero comes to inception, which will be backed by silver (The Amero will be True Quid in that it will be Sterling in that it will be backed by silver ha ha) you can convert the Pounds back to Ameros which will be pegged around 10 dollars to the Amero.  But if you hold pounds, you will get more, as you will not fall prey to the collapse of the US dollar in such a direct way.  It is true that the world is effected by it, but no country will get hit as hard as US itself.        Or you can choose to short the Dow Jones buy buying DXD on NYSE which is a gurantee of making mega bucks.  Even if you bring back the Pound to the US at a lousy rate, your profits on shorting the dow will make you the money.
