By the time he inherits my money he'll know what to do to preserve and grow it - don't think it will be a cheque on his 18th birthday with a note saying "Party hard, son".      You don't teach someone to drive a car by pointing at one on the road and explaining how the engine works.  You get them behind the wheel and teach them how to avoid hitting things.      I agree that doling out cash on demand is bad practice.  What I'm talking about here is investing for his future, maybe for things that I may have to pay for like education and house deposit.  Maybe for a portfolio for him to practice with.      Is helping a person get into the property market at an earlier age than they may otherwise be able to a bad idea?  Specially with housing affordability going the way it is?  Is getting them into the share market a bad idea?      Anything can (and probably will) happen.  He may end up being independently wealthy in which case I'll blow it all on a big bash for my 50th birthday.      So apart from the philosophical debate, let's hear your ideas on the best way to invest for the long term - i.e. 20 to 30 years.                       Hey I agree ! What you do with your cash is your business. And besides it all depends on your own background I expect....I put myself through uni, got my own house deposit, started my own investments, even though my parents could have probably helped had I asked them. There is something about doing it yourself.      Investing for 25-30 years ? My advice would be to avoid "picking winners". "Picking Winners" can be buying a house, or specific blue chip shares. You level of confidence in a 30 year investment horizon can only be taken at a macro level.      I have all my investments in Index linked funds.       1. Because of the low fees   2. Because I do not believe that I have any chance of picking the "winners" and avoiding the "losers" and I have a Masters Degree in Commerce!   3. I have no faith that some spotty kid at HSBC is going to be able to pick the winners any more than a spotty kid a Citibank. Year by year they may, but over the course of the investment cycles managed mutual funds look  average . Which of course is what you would expect. And they charge you HUGE fees for being average.   4. So, if you believe that economic growth will drive the sharemarket higher over the next 2-3 decades, and you don't belive you or anyone else can pick the winners and avoid the losers, then avoid the fees and invest in an index fund.      Anything else borders on speculation given the timeframe you are investing for.      VM
