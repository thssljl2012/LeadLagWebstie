                           Banks can be nationalized, simply because no sane person will                         want to withdraw their entire deposits. Where will they keep it                         where it can be safe?                                                       With a democratic govt's guarantee on deposits, there                         is no fear that the govt cant pay depositors even if every wants                         back their money, simply because govt owns real resources -                         minerals and agriculture, which are necessary for humanity to                         survive and must pay for it, therefore as long as a country has                         resources,                                                       ( or a non-resource country has collateral in the resource rich                         country ), money will always grow. $1 today to $100 tomorrow when                         more resources are dug out or produced for survival.                                                       AIG or insurance companies MUST NOT be nationalized. They are                         nothing more than ponzi schemes where the bottom pays for the top                         with a pool of money, which is 'invested' (gambled) in the stock                         market (high class casino), to generate money to pay off                         depositors, as well as insurance claims.                                                       Think - buy a policy at $100 a month, but if an accident occurs                         the next month, your next of kin gets $1,000,000 in insurance                         claims. Where did the $999,900 came from?                                                       Ans: Policy holders pool of funds, new entrants who buy policy,                         and invested ( gambled) money.                                                       Banks do not payout $1,000,000 or hold any insurance claims, but                         insurance companies do. If nationalized, it may mean taxpayers will                         be paying for the claims. The AIG directors are probably laffing                         away after pocketing the policy holder's money, as well as other                         companies who benefited from AIG losses.                                                       Money do not disappear. It ALWAYS ends up in someone else's                         pocket. US taxpayers will be the suckers if AIG is                         nationalized.                                                       John Keynes did not say prop up failed companies, rather                         instead, govt spending to assist in the circulation of money to                         create further money. Giving to AIG is no keynesian theory, perhaps                         an Obama or Wall street theory.
