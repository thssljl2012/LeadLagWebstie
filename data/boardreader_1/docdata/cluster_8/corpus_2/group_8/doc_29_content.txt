 AOB Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Re: wheres is a miller99      For those of us who have lost money on AOB the only consultation is that there are so many others companies that we could have lost a lot more money in.

C's 52 week high is 27.35, so today's price means a loss of 95%. Pretty brutal either way. Of course, it looks like C is going to end up worthless. That's not likely to happen to AOB ........
