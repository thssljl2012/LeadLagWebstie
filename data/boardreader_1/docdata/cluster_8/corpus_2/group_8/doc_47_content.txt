         A I G's unwiley sense of entitlement continues .        Somebody needs to seriously remind them it's NOT business as usual .A I G  is having financial ' trouble ' - OH WELL - F U - and have a nice day .        A refresher on capitalism &amp; competion for the AIG execs/whores .In any competition,especially in capitalism there are winners and loosers .Repeat winners AND LOOSERS -like A I G        A I G lost their  'entitlement' to these bonuses/incentives when they 'almost' F A I L E D .AIG lost the right to them because in effect they are company that shouldn't even be in business let alone conducting business as usual        How is this fair to the insurance companies that managed their finances better than AIG ? Where the F does A I G get off thinking they even have a right to return to the norm ? A I G is the over blown insurance company that LOST taking BETs that THEIR  'experts' allowed .        Is if fair to the competition that they don't even have a chance to recruit some of the alleged talent AIG wants to retain with TARP funded bonuses ? The competition or competent insurance companies don't have the tax payers funding their recruitment efforts .        Don't give me this too big to fail crap-A I G LOST .If LOOSING means the LOOSER must sacrifice some of the very same expenses that got em into trouble then that's what it means .It is NOT business as usual nor does AIG really have the right to conduct business as usual .        You LOST AIG ,YOU ARE A LOOSER COMPANY-to the winner goes the spoils ie your people to the competition . F U !!!
