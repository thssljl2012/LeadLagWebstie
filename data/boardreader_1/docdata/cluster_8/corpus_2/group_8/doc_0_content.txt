AIG used to have jewel on the crown kind of credit. So when it decides to sell its credibility and promise to cover the losses, as a result, the risk of those instrument/contract, whatever you call it, were shifted away from those who sold it to AIG, because AIG had such golden credibility, those derivatives would suddenly have the same kind of AAA rating as AIG had, which made them seem like 100% safe investment, much easier to sell. In return, AIG was paid lucrative fees, as you can see, when time is good, it's highly profitable business cuz what AIG sells are credibility and promises which AIG used to have seemly unlimited supplies. But when time turned bad, loss of those instrument/contract piles up, AIG has to put up more and more money to cover those losses, and AIG also promised to set aside more money as collaterals if credit rating of a type of instrument/contract insured by AIG was downgraded, AND AIG also promised to many quite prudent investment funds that if the supposedly safest among safest bonds bought by those investment funds go bad, AIG would buy them back. Now you can see the potential domino effect: AIG's insurance, to large extent, determines the prices of the very "asset" held by those banks/various funds. If AIG goes under, so does the promises, what's gonna happen to the asset to obligation ratios of all the financial institutions? And what's gonna happen to their creditworthiness? What's gonna happen to investment confidence? To prevent that from happening, somebody must step in to basically replace AIG to keep those promises AIG made and profited from, given the size of AIG and the current economic environment, the only one that can step in is the government.                         Can't rep you twice in a row, but you certainly deserve it for your posts in this thread.
