My personal vignette about this wonderful idea of Federal largesse to save the likes of Citibank has come around to this.   I have had a Citi credit card for at least 10 years if not longer. I had my avg interest rate (on $20,000+ debt) down to around 12%, not horrible for credit card interest.  Just in the past month, Citi informed me that they had increased my credit interest rate to 29.99% on all of my former balance &amp;amp; future purchases.   I guess this was their way of saying Happy Holidays to me after they have received at least $45 BILLION of taxpayer money since late summer of 2008.  Isn't that just special, how one can be treated at the hands of these incompetent &amp;quot;money managers&amp;quot;......
