The only way you can move up is to make your quarterly sales goals, have perfect customer loyalty scores month to month as well as a few other things they require. You could have your masters but if you don't do those things you are staying where you are at.             Wow I was thinking about applying for a Branch manager position out of college until the Financial jobs are stable again. Commerce Bank says it just requires a bachelors degree and prior work experience in retail or customer service or banking.             I would tell you, going from your current work position to a branch manager position will be veeeeeeeery tough. I was a stand in branch manager for about 6 months after the fired ours and our csm left. It's not as easy as it looks. I would suggest going in as a banker/csm, learn the ways of the bank, the Operations side, RQA, all of the federal/state regulations, get your feet wet in both sides of it before you jump to a branch manager position, which is more actual experience based than schooling.             Great advice. I was thinking of looking into a banking position in lawrence to replace my current job, but I'm not sure about how flexible some banks are with college students.             as teller they are pretty flexible, banker not as much, depends if you have back up management or not. CSM/BM you have to be able to open or close any day of the week. I will look and see if us bank has anything out there in Lawrence. They are not Metro, they are community so I don't know what I'll be able to find. _________________
