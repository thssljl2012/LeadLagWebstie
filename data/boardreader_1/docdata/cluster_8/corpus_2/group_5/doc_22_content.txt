 Hi to all from a newbie. Would like to say have been a &amp;amp;quot;lurker&amp;amp;quot; for a long time and have received many blessings from Frank and many others on this site. Thank you.       Could I please ask a favor. Have been an investor for a couple years, but have a relative who would like to purchase for the first time. We live in Southern California, could someone please recommend a place for us to purchase. Are we still able to purchase from Bank of America? We do not have Chase Bank here as far as I know. Thank you so much in advance for your help.
