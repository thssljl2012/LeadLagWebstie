   Mef,        That&amp;#039;s all bs. Your argument that failing companies should not be bailed out went right out the window when CONgress bailed out the banks.  So, forget that bs.  This is no longer a reasoned argument anymore.  When the people see we are bailing out these shysters for no damn moral or legal reason, then this is what we should expect, the wrath of the people when they don&amp;#039;t get &amp;quot;their portion&amp;quot; of the $700 bailout.  It was, after all, the people&amp;#039;s money.         No one has been more opposed to bailouts than me.  They defy any notion of capitalism.  The bailouts proved once and for all we live in an oligarchy, not a capitalist democracy.  Now that people realize that, they are pissed.  I predict it will only get worse.  Good.  Tar and feather every CONgressman and banker.         P.S. - Now, no one held a gun to Bank of America&amp;#039;s head and made them take the $25 billion.
