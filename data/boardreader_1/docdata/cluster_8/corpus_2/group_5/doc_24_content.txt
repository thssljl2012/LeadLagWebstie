Yeah, right. I don&amp;#039;t think any reasonable analysis of their balance sheet would justify this logic. Unless I completely misunderstand what &amp;amp;quot;they cba to invest&amp;amp;quot; means....       GM  did  start investing in clean fuel and high MPG, quite a long time ago, but they&amp;#039;ve never invested in it in a  serious  way. That&amp;#039;s why they keep showcasing fuel-efficient cars that they&amp;#039;ll sell in five or ten years and meanwhile everyone else releases them.       That&amp;#039;s why they sell 20MPG hybrids of giant SUVs that, at this point, hardly anyone even wants anymore anyways, and make a big deal about their highly fuel efficient 30MPG sedans when their competitors normal gasoline cars made 36 or 38 or even 40MPG  without  any really special technology years ago. If GM had been serious in its investment in high fuel efficiency, don&amp;#039;t ask why they don&amp;#039;t have a Prius on the road. Ask why the Cobalt or the Saturn version of the Astra, released into the middle of this quagmire, get 25-30% worse fuel efficiency than same-segment Hondas.      If this is in part to blame for GM&amp;#039;s fiscal blows, then it&amp;#039;s just another sign of the general mismanagement at GM and nothing specific to the environmental issue. This is the same confused product strategy that builds a pretty good car and then buries it on page 78 of the product catalog after endless pages of crap, and wonders why no one notices it. This is the same confused product strategy that allowed them to not only let their traditional brands founder in brand identity but could even take in a relatively iconic (if quirky) brand like Saab and then even turn its two car lineup into a hodgepodge of oxymorons.
