They were given that money to get credit flowing again, because no one was lending anything.    They should be extending credit to companies to save as many jobs / other companies as possible right now, that&amp;#039;s the point of the bailout.    They shouldn&amp;#039;t just throw it around to anyone who might want it, but this company isn&amp;#039;t necessarily &amp;amp;quot;failing&amp;amp;quot; .. they&amp;#039;re simply closing that plant because they couldn&amp;#039;t get credit.     The point of the bailout was to save the credit/lending industry and to protect our economy.  Yes, they put stipulations on the bailout to help private and small businesses.  However, it is not the responsibility of Bank of America to bail out failing businesses.  If a company has been declined a credit line increase it means they are already very much in debt and have shown the inability to pay it back.  It was never the purpose of this bailout to force the banks into another series of poor investments.  Businesses are going to go under due to the economic crisis we are in.  We need to let some of them go under.  And regardless of that loan, the plant is still going to close.  They just needed the money to pay out severance packages and backed up holiday/vacation pay the business owner promised the employees... roughly $3500 each.  It is not the responsibility the bank to pay the severance packages for failing businesses.    When Chrysler goes under do you believe the banks who loaned the company money should be forced to pay for the employees severance packages?  Is it really their responsibility?  Businesses should not promise what they can&amp;#039;t afford, and third party lenders shouldn&amp;#039;t be responsible for those promises.
