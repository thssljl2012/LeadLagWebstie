If you can prove this you will have no problem obtaining clients -- since you are the one selling this we hardly can believe you.      For those that believe it can be done why not contact the big 5 banks directly and ask them -- if this group can do it, you can do it yourself.      We have contacted in fact contacted the big 5 banks and each and every one stated you must visit the branch in the US to open an account and you must have a tax payer identification number or SSN to do so.      Bank of America   Citibank, USA   Wells Fargo   Wachovia   Washington Mutual      The only other banking option is Accent banking which charges a 5% fee for all account loading and is not a real, full unrestricted bank account -- it is a debit card and sort of quasi bank account.

Really, But i successfully open an account even i&amp;#039;m not a US resident. The bank i mention in that is site is one of the best international bank and if you have a credit card from them i assure you, you can open a US Bank Account without being a US resident.      There is only 2 or 3 Bank in the US that allow non US resident to open an account.      Thanks   Nanflexal
