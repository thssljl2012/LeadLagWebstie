Hopefully, somewhere within this management is fired!  No, not seriously.  Now I am pandering to someone within this thread.  Never was this much effort put in to the financial melt down and our politicians tossed over a hundred billion at AIG.  What for?  Because they are global.  Yeah right!  The insurance arm of AIG was profitable and funded.  They did some swaps for easy money and they got burned.  The company committed a crime and every person in this country paid them for it.  This country, our elected officials are embarrassing us with this circus called &amp;amp;quot;bail-out&amp;amp;quot;.  Man if I smoked I light one up for sure....:-)
