Minime;   Relations be reassessed? I&amp;#039;ll say. US passports with micro chips were farmed out to China? I guess we don&amp;#039;t have anybody here to do this contract.      BTW, Bank of America is trying to buy a Chinese bank with bailout money.      Can we all ask what they are smoking?      Chinese banks intervened in Forex, 7 times in the last 2 sessions, a long with   the Won and Indian Rupee,and of course Yen.
