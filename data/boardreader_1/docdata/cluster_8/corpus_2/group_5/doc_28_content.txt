I would do 2 things now.  Firstly make an application to the Court on n244 for an order to prevent Citi from applying the default,based on the facts that it is a disputed account,and also in breach of guidelines laid down by the OFT.If you leave the default notice to run,then you may have problems trying to defend it later.Citi are in breach of civil procedure rules too-they have failed to follow proper pre action protocols.  You should write to Eversheds and state that you will be filing a complaint to the FOS.  Tell them you will be asking the Court to suspend the default with an application for costs too.
