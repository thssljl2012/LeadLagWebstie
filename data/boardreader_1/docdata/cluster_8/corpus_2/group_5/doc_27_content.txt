Hi,   I don't have a CC to verify my paypal account. So my bro took a add-on card for me. I got the card but before I go ahead with the verification I wanted to know a few things. its a HDFC bank credit card, and where I am having little confusion is that the primary card and the add-on card has the same card number and the same CVV number. Only difference is the name of the card holder printed on the card. (I remember my friend's add-on card which was Citibank and had different number than the primary card). So, when I enter the card details and my name in paypal for verification purpose, which name the card is gonna show up? mine? or the primary card holder? So, will the verification process work with this card. I called up the customer care but that didn't help. So, if someone knows about this pls help
