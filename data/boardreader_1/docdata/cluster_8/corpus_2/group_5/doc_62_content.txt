Fact of the matter is that this financial mes was created by the banks and the governments that allowed them to do what they wished without oversight. GM has been cutting costs and closing plants to bring capacity in line with projected demand. They have trimmed the labour force by around 48&amp;#37;. The UAW (and CAW) has made huge concessions over the last 8 years, and helped GM save billions of dollars. While GM sold more vehicles than anyone last year, they are 5th in total number of employees. More employees will be reduced as the plants slated for closing are in fact closed. The wheels have been in motion for a number of years now.   Allowing them to go bankrupt, will destroy the brands and make them unsellable, which in turn would make a restructure unlikely if not impossible. It was for this reason that the Bank of America, which banks every other family in the US, &amp;quot;saved&amp;quot; Merrill Lynch, before they went bankrupt, by paying a huge, seemingly out of line price for them. They could have bought them far more cheaply if they were allowed to go bankrupt, but the firm would have been valueless, because the brand would have been destroyed.    Perhaps some would like to see, complete failure and a starting over of the labour market, so that everyone would have their wages reduced, but, quite frankly, I'm not one of them. There are lot of holier than thou people who would be in for a huge shock when they find out they aren't worth what they think they are.    So far, no one has mentioned shareholders here or the governments resposibility to them. This meltdown is unlike anything I have seen in my lifetime, and is not likely to change in the near term. We have a rough few years ahead of us, and may never get back to where we were.
