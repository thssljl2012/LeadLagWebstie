Thursday night also saw JP Morgan preannounce a "terrible fourth quarter" and dropping sharply, Bank of America announcing huge layoffs, and the auto-bailout deal falling through.&amp;nbsp;   And somewhat improbably, all the major indices ended up (and I, a confessed and lonely bull, had mentally prepared myself for a 5% drop in my portfolio).&amp;nbsp;        thread start
