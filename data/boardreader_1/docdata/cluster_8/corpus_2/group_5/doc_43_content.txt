                                                              TS,    I&amp;#039;d like to ask you soemthing. You did the application yourself?     Didn&amp;#039;t a bank staff called your up to help you out?    I&amp;#039;ve been through same situation as you before and i needed the card for the purpose of paying upfront for official travelling expenses (Hotel stays, transportation on official businesses).    So I applied for cards from Citibank and UOB first, then followed by OCBC and DBS.    same situation as you, i had my pay adjustment earlier this year.    Eventually, my application for OCBC and DBS cards were rejected.    But after some help from the Citibank staff who followed up with my 2nd Citibank application, i got the card from Citibank. Shortly after that, UOB also sent me a card but with a lower limit compared to Citibank.    I still thinks Citibank has the best customer service. They don&amp;#039;t make you recite your card number over the phone and takes security seriously.                                                                  __________________       [SIZE=1]born to lose  live to win[/SIZE]
