            But isn&amp;#039;t that what the bailout is supposed to be for?  No...they bailout was for the banks to remain solvent because so many people like you stopped paying the mortgage. That way they could continue lending...of course the catch 22 is they have stiffenend their lending practices to be more practical and you sir and you&amp;#039;re ilk are a bad risk. Why would they lend to deadbeats?
