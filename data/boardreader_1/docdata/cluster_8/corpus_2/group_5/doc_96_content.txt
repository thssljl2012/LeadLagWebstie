Did you even read the article or do you work for Bank of America?  Seriously guy, there are laws that protect these exact things from happening to soldiers that are overseas in service of this nation. It is kind of difficult to take care of your financial affairs when you are 7000 miles away, in a warzone. A similar thing happened to me, and the letter from the bank telling me there was a problem with my account took over a month to be forwarded to my APO. Sorry, I was busy trying not to get killed. A problem with a routing number was the least of my concerns.  On a side note, the reason the banks are in this situation are in large part from selling toxic loans to uninformed homeowners. They dug their own grave so don't give me any of that financial stability *****.
