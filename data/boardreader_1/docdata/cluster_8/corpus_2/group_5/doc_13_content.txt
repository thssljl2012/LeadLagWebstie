If you can do this then you might squeak thru but from memory max with cba on low doc is $1M under their underwriting authority.  Over 1.5M can go to genworth to assess.      Raymond - I'll take the hit and say sorry for the confusion on my part... the reason I was asking is that your threads from PI.com and your raymondBDM name threw me (in broker speak a BDM is a business development manager).    IMO - it will be good to have an expert on new Rams on the forum (we've stayed away from them traditionally/pre-meltdown) so we'll probably all start to learn a bit more about them with you adding in.
