         Throw Wells Fargo in there as well. They&amp;#039;ve been hittin&amp;#039; me with &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; charges. The kook on the phone was the most unprofessional, rudest prick I&amp;#039;ve ever talked to. Raised his voice at me and that was all it took.  Told him to go fvck himself and hung up on him. Closing my account today. STAY AWAY FROM WELLS FARGO!!!   Time to start stuffing a matress.         --------------------  www.lokboxfins.com
