Hi      Am booking some accomodation in New Zealand. As it is a privately owned property the owners are requesting that I pay direct into their bank account.      I am in Australia and was wondering what the most cost effective way of transferring the cash. I am transferring about NZD 750 so do not want to get slugged with disproportinate bank fees.      I bank with Bankwest, but friends have access to ANZ if that is any easier..
