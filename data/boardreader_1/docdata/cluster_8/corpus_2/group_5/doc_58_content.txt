 My DH handles that because I'm bad at money. I can make it and spend it, but I'm bad at managing it. I know DH has a spreadsheet and lists our incomes and the bills we pay, whether they're auto pay, and if so which day the payments go out. And I learned today how to set up bill pay in our joint checking account. I'd go that route if I were you; it's so easy I can even do it! Ifyou're with Wells Fargo, I think they may charge you for auto pay, but I don't believe US Bank does, and I know the bank we're at now does not.
