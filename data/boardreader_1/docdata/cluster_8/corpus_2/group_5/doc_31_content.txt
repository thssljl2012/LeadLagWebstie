On that score, even the most diligent -- nay, desperate -- search of the economy, the markets, politics and the world at large, we can ruefully attest, yields precious little in the way of glad tidings.  Instead, the temptation is to throw one's hands up in despair and sit upon the ground and tell sad tales of the death of hedge funds and equally mournful calamities. The burn rate in jobs is intensifying, and as Bank of America's cheerless announcement that it plans to send out 35,000 pink slips over the next three years illustrates, it's not likely to simmer down anytime soon.  The jobs picture, which increasingly resembles in ugliness the subject of a Lucian Freud portrait, didn't get any prettier in the latest weekly report. New unemployment claims weighed in at a hefty 573,000, or some 40,000 more than the cockeyed seers in Wall Street anticipated and a quarter of a million more than in the same week last year. Relief is nowhere in sight.  Our friends at the Liscio Report, whose only vice is their measured restraint, quote a study by Michael Dueker, a former staffer of the St. Louis Fed (not many wild-eyed types there), that intimates another four to five million jobs could go up in smoke before hiring replaces firing in early 2010 (hopefully).  Along with jobs, household net worth, we learn, is doing an incredible vanishing act. Hammered by the one-two punch of collapsing house and stock prices, it shrank a formidable 4.7% in the third quarter to $56.5 trillion, from the all-time peak of $63.6 trillion in the like three months of '07, just before the roof fell in. That represented the steepest quarterly drop since Uncle Sam started keeping tabs way back in 1952.  In the circumstances, it isn't surprising, we suppose, that Jane and John Q. borrowed less than they did in the same quarter last year for the first time ever or that retail sales last month did a beautiful swan dive or that Michael Darda at Connecticut-based MKM Partners forecasts &amp;quot;at least three more quarters of negative consumer spending before the economy begins to climb out of the current ditch.&amp;quot;  We must confess that the unnerving sight of an economy being in full plunge, much worse than anything we've ever had the displeasure to see in all these years of our role as professional spectator, gives us enormous pause when all around us even normally skeptical types are making bullish noises about the stock market.  The market, the technicians keep telling us, is ready to rally, and maybe it is. But until the economy stops hemorrhaging, we suspect that contrary to the conventional wisdom, even the rallies won't be all that great. As for a real bottom, that won't happen until everyone and his sister stops looking for it.  ONCE AGAIN, AS SO OFTEN in recent months, we have to ask your forgiveness for failing to provide a full accounting of this proud nation's metastasizing economic and financial ailments, for fear of inducing anxiety overload among our revered readers. In any case, we're eager to share with you the fruits, meager as they may be, of our earnest hunt for something other than further evidence of decline and fall.  That something, it turns out, is a bumper crop, not of corn or wheat or lentils, but of another increasingly abundant commodity -- instant celebrity rogues. Rarely, if ever, have we been privileged to witness such a splendid array of purported errancy crowded into so short a time.  We're thinking, of course, of Marc Dreier, Bernard Madoff and Rod Blagojevich, all of whom allegedly were separately engaged in almost unimaginably brazen and grandiose schemes in pursuit of lucre. Dreier, the head of a New York-based law firm bearing his name (and not bearing up very well), is accused of being &amp;quot;a Houdini of impersonation and false documents,&amp;quot; who through chutzpah and devilry stole a cool $380 million.  Madoff is a veteran Wall Street trader and asset manager who purportedly relieved his investors of billions of dollars via a $50 billion Ponzi scheme (by comparison, poor old Ponzi was a piker). What his investors lacked in numbers, they more than made up in wealth. Which proves that cupidity and stupidity are as rife among the rich as among us peons.  Rod Blagojevich is the Democratic governor of Illinois, of whom, except for the fact that he had a surname we had trouble correctly pronouncing and wore his hair in the fashion of Mamie Eisenhower or Laurence Olivier playing Henry V, we had only the most fugitive impression. Until, that is, last week, when he suddenly was the man of the hour, whose youthful and furtive features were splashed all over the front pages of newspapers, big and small, and became the staple of television news and the biggest source of cyberspace buzz.  What suddenly thrust Mr. Blagojevich into the merciless media maw was the allegation that he sought to peddle to the highest bidder the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama, who has found another job. If it emerges that Mr. Blagojevich did proffer the seat to anyone with an itch to be a senator and the scratch to purchase it, he was merely following in the footsteps of his immediate predecessor, a Republican named George Ryan. In which case, the chances look favorable for him to join Mr. Ryan, currently sampling the government's hospitality at a Club Fed for an unrelated piece of mischief.  Leafing through the criminal complaint filed against Mr. Blagojevich, one discovers that what prompted him to conduct his own private auction of the Senate appointment was not abominable greed, but a touching concern for his family.  You see, the Blagojevichs' family income averaged well over $300,000 annually over the past five years, which might seem like a lot of money, because it is. But the little expenses add up and eat you alive when you're governor -- a shoeshine every single day, for example -- and, like any good family man, at some point you begin to worry about the future.  OK, let's assume Blagojevich wasn't a straight rod. It seems to us that swapping a Senate seat or similar valuable asset for a wad of cash or a cushy job is standard operating procedure for presidents, governors and other political bigwigs when they have to go. Mr. Blagojevich's trouble is not so much what he did, but how he did it. Pure and simple, the guy lacks couth.  Actually, auctioning a vacant seat in Congress might be just the ticket in these trying times for state governments in dire need of moola. Even if it became a widespread practice, it's not likely to diminish the quality of the Congress. Off hand, we can't think of anything that could.  The sudden exposure of so much improbable but whopping fraud and wrongdoing no doubt can be credited in some significant part to the collapse of the markets and the economy. And we submit it as a ray of sunshine in the otherwise pervasive gloom. Or, to change the meteorological metaphor, it's an ill wind and all that.  IF IT'LL ASSUAGE THE PAIN ANY, you're not alone in taking a big hit in the stock market. Mr. Paulson's outfit, the Treasury Department, has been getting its lumps from this mean old bear, as well. As part of the bank bailout, the Treasury wound up with options to buy up to 1.2 million shares of common stock of sundry beleaguered institutions with an aggregate value of $27 billion. A little over a month later, according to an AP analysis, the options are worth about $19 billion.  When queried, a Treasury official was undaunted, informing the news service a tad huffily, &amp;quot;We're not day traders.&amp;quot; To which we say, too bad.  IN A POWWOW WITH REPUBLICAN senatorial muckamucks on whether or not to bail out the Big Three, Dick Cheney reportedly warned his fellow GOPers that they were in danger of invoking the ghost of Herbert Hoover if they told Detroit to drop dead. Implicit, obviously, in the veep's caution was the notion that just as the Democrats successfully ran against Hoover for decades, the Republicans might pay the price for years to come of causing a fresh surge of mayhem by allowing the auto makers to go under.  And we've been thinking pretty much along the same lines. Whatever the theoretical merits of bankruptcy (and in this instance, they strike us as extremely problematic), the reality is that chaos would likely ensue. As indicated above, things are bad enough without contriving to make them worse.  The opposition to bailing out Detroit might be credited with adhering to principle were it not, as we've noted before, that it comes so heavily from representatives of states that just happen to be laden with facilities of foreign car makers, logical beneficiaries if the Big Three weren't around.  One of the recurring criticisms of GM, Ford and Chrysler is that they're not making the kind of cars that have served Toyota and Honda so well. That's true enough, but it's also, considering the way things are, somewhat pass.  What's killing the domestic auto companies currently is also inflicting serious damage on their foreign rivals. As the clich has it, It's the economy, stupid!  In November, while sales of GM tumbled 41%, Chrysler 47% and Ford 31%, Toyota's were down 34%, Honda's 32% and Hyundai's 40%, mostly better, perhaps, but nothing to write home about. We rest our case.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
