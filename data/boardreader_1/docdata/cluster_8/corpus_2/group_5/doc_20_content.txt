In my experience, US bank branch employees will react to foreign currency as if it's covered with anthrax.  Big cities with a lot of international visitors will have currency exchange shops in the touristy areas, but ordinary banks will probably be clueless.  You might have to head to the big city, but call a few banks near you first just in case it's your lucky day.
