That&amp;#039;s it (besides the legal benefits of incorporationg).    And I can sue if I spill McDonald&amp;#039;s hot coffee in my lap.  That doesn&amp;#039;t prove that the lawsuit is just or with merit.  In fact, it&amp;#039;s obviously not just or right.  So I am frankly not sure why you are telling my opinion is &amp;quot;wrong.&amp;quot;  Just because something is done a certain way doesn&amp;#039;t make it &amp;quot;right.&amp;quot;  Further, the majority of businesses in the US are small businesses.  They don&amp;#039;t have public shares/stockholders.  While I am picking nits here, it&amp;#039;s fun proving that broad sweeping generalizations are easily shot down.       quote:  Now, usually having good customers service is in the corporations best interest, since happy customers are returning customers.    Are you daft?  We&amp;#039;re not talking about a small mom-and-pop restuarant or convenience store.  We&amp;#039;re talking about huge corporations losing millions of their customers - millions of potential revenue streams.  Trite little expressions don&amp;#039;t mean squat here.  THE customer makes or breaks every business.  Every single one.  Even the privately held small businesses that don&amp;#039;t have a board, or shareholders.    quote:  Anyway, as for the Citi changing it&amp;#039;s rates thing, who gives a crap? Close the card and get another one. It&amp;#039;s not like there is a derth of CC&amp;#039;s out there.    I realize that Ars is a bastion of liberality.  And with that, values and principles are thrown out with the bath water.  But news flash, some of us do have unwavering principles and hold others to them as well.  I expect better treatment than I am getting so I will pursue that.  The reason companies get away with crap like that is because the majority of people have become spineless and simply accept such treatment or run from it.  You must stand for something or fall for anything I sez.  To me, that is far better use of my time than going through the hassles of filtering through all the card offers, finding one I like, then getting the card.   Not to mention the credit rating hit for closing my oldest established card!
