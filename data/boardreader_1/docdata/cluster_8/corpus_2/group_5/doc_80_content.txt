The BANKS must receive AT LEAST the same scrutiny as the auto companies. Notice how Ford said, &amp;amp;quot;no, thanks&amp;amp;quot;. You don&amp;#039;t get accountability if you don&amp;#039;t DEMAND it.     This is why Bank Of America is wrong to open accounts for illegal residents and approving home loans without verified resident status.
