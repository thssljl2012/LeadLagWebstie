I was against the financial services bailout (and the airline bailouts).  If one was to argue the different bailouts based on relative merit I think the financial services bailout has the most merit because the credit markets impact everyone rather than a relatively small percentage of the population, but even that is a stretch in my opinion.  The financial services bailout was also a reactionary, poorly designed package that has done very little to help anybody.  I fear that the auto bailout will be more of the same.
