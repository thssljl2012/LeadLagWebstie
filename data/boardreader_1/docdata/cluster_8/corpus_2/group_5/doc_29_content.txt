While all of America has to tighten their belts the Dems want the UAW in there with all their benefits untouched and REALLY out of synch with other automakers. This is one battle the Dems have to lose. Even with bankrupcy and restructure, the UAW needs to be not allowed back in. We don't need them any longer.     The big three automakers already have two tiered wage structures where the newer employees make less and have fewer benefits than the older employees who are on the verge of retirement. The issue is primarily benefits to retirees. The big three pension benefits are very similar to the ones we are all paying for public employees. Most of the anti-union posters probably do not realize that only 12.1% of the work force is unionized and the majority of them are public not private workers, i.e. police, teachers, municipal workers. The mantra of unions are obsolete and business needs to be deregulated confuses dreams with reality.  While both business and unions have gone to the dark side of greed both are still necessary. Anti-union posters should be aware that without unions the nominal 5 day 40 hour week, pensions, healthcare, paid vacation, and most employee benefits would not exist without unions. Why is there such antipathy to helping the big three while the 700 billion tarp and taking on billions more in Citibank and AIG liabilities is considered necessary? One must remember that despite the carmakers legacy costs and mismanagement they were doing ok until the banking credit crisis caused by the over leveraged financial wizards.
