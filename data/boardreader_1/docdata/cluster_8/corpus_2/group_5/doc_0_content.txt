No mention at all of any of the things you mentioned, My cousin called a Chase in Indianapolis and got the same info I did. Again, no mention of a reprint or having to go to Iraq to exchange!!!                      Thanks for your response,I called Chase Bank in Lexington,The manager told me that the vendor (BOA) stop selling Dinar to them and that there was a new currency.I said what do you mean? She said that on my screen it says &amp;amp;quot;new currency&amp;amp;quot; also that you have till 12-15-08 to come in and exchange the old currency for the new currency.I then asked would there be a fee? She said no. I then asked if I had a $25,000 Dinar note could I exchange it for the new currency and get $25,000 Dinar? She said as far as I know. I am not trying to start a rumor,This is just the information givin to me. I tried to do research on why Chase stopped selling Dinar and came across this. I just wanted to see if anyone else heard this if you would call Chase banks and ask and see what you find out.     KTF
