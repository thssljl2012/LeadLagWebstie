 I have proof that the Bank and CEO&amp;#039;s had been meeting for months before the workers were laid off. The workers got 3 days notice when they were suppose to get 60 days notice or 60 days pay . Here is a proof that they were meeting all along what were they talking about where lets see the minutes of these meetings.       &amp;amp;quot; Bank of America isnt empowered to tell a company how to manage its business, spokeswoman Julie Westermann said yesterday. Republic is unable to operate profitably in the current economy, she said. &amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;Bank of America has worked with the company and shared our concerns about the companys situation and its operations for the &amp;amp;quot; past several months, she said. It is unfortunate that the company has been unable to reverse its declining circumstances.             The CEO&amp;#039;s got more then 60 days notice, the bank knew the what the outcome was going to be. To loan the company money in the first place they knew what the outstanding company obligations were this includes union contracts . Make the contract between the company and bank public and lets see what when on. Most contracts would have some collteral protection for the bank and these obligations must be paid was the obligation to the union a part of this protection?      If the banks don&amp;#039;t want to shoulder any of the obigations then I say the State should withdraw the people&amp;#039;s money and put it elsewhere.
