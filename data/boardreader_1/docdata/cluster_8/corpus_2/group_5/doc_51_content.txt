  quote:   couldn&amp;#039;t care less about the devaluation of assets. (I&amp;#039;m assuming you mean their stock.)     Nope. I&amp;#039;m talking principally about the derivatives that have become so illiquid that mark-to-market renders them virtually worthless.    quote:  The problem as I see it is that companies like Citi only care about the share holders.     I don&amp;#039;t know what the fuck you&amp;#039;re blathering about.  I don&amp;#039;t think you really have much of an idea about the situation.  The people who lose if Citi goes under are people with money deposited at Citi, the FDIC when they have to pay out, the government when it has to pay out, and every other bank that&amp;#039;s going to now face a run on its reserves because what was the second largest bank in the US has gone out of business, and if it can fail, they all can.  Government bailouts have nothing to do with Citi&amp;#039;s credit card business.    quote:  That is your opinion. Stating it as fact doesn&amp;#039;t make it thus. You even used the word &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; which directly conveys opinion.    It conveys moral imperative.    quote:  Under the generally held understanding of several Citibank credit card holders who have posted in this thread, the sudden, unexpected rate increase was completely arbitrary. Whether or not it was warranted from the POV that unsecured debt should be expensive is immaterial. It happened to people to whom it has not happened in the past. It was not announced, it was not anticipated, it was not expected.    It is not &amp;quot;completely arbitrary&amp;quot;.  The cost of lending has shot up (base rate be damned, it&amp;#039;s irrelevant).    quote:  It was not announced, it was not anticipated, it was not expected.    Um, it was announced, and it is that announcement that SkySlash is bitching about!    quote:  It was not expected because people with a good credit history generally get treated favorably. (And let&amp;#039;s be honest here, a rate increase is not favorable treatment.)     A rate increase for people with a good history does fuck all, because people with a good history don&amp;#039;t pay the rate at all.    quote:  Sorry, I said spurious (deceitful) when I meant aribitrary (random). Although I admit deceitful is a good word too because who can possibly read and understand all of the card holder agreement? It&amp;#039;s meant to be confusing so that it is easier to take advantage of the customer. And yet they call it &amp;quot;service.&amp;quot;    It was not deceitful--they are being open and honest about what they are doing, and giving people plenty of warning (as they are required to do)--and it was not arbitrary--they are putting rates up because their cost of borrowing has gone up, their default rate has gone up, and so they need to (a) encourage people to pay off their balances (b) make more money from those people who carry a balance in order to offset the risk of future defaults.
