But now American taxpayer dollars are being used to promote products based on Sharia?       In fairness to AIG, there are many who do not understand the political Islamic supremacist nature of Sharia.       Stop Sharia Now (FAQ item 17) provides a quote regarding an &amp;amp;quot;Islamic Finance conference&amp;amp;quot; in New York City where an attendee asked the meaning of Sharia. One of AIG&amp;#039;s Sharia advisors, Sheik Nizam Yaquby, ambiguously responded by stating that &amp;amp;quot;Shariah is the path on which we walk, the water which we drink.&amp;amp;quot; Those of us who are aware that Sharia is a legal codification for all aspects of Islamic supremacist life grasp what Yaquby was trying to communicate; certainly none of the supremacist aspects of Sharia was communicated by Yaquby. It is then reported that &amp;amp;quot;Not one person in the room followed up with a question. The group went back to looking at flowcharts and graphs.&amp;amp;quot; So it should be little surprise that few people involved with Sharia finance products actually understand the ramifications of promoting Islamic supremacist Sharia.       To give AIG an opportunity to respond to this, I called the individual listed on AIG&amp;#039;s press release for its Sharia Takaful Homeowners Policy, Jim Crain, and talked to him about the AIG product. My impression is that AIG&amp;#039;s Jim Crain is a businessman, and I got the distinct feeling that he was uncomfortable with being named as the AIG point of contact on a product with political connotations. I told AIG&amp;#039;s Jim Crain about the online petition signed by over 100 individuals calling for the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of Treasury to call for AIG to divest itself of its Sharia businesses. I also told AIG&amp;#039;s Jim Crain about how the Islamic supremacist Taliban and other groups are seeking to promote Sharia.       AIG&amp;#039;s Jim Crain told me that he had no comment on AIG&amp;#039;s Sharia product linkage to the Islamic supremacist Sharia ideology, but stated that with &amp;amp;quot;this business venture&amp;amp;quot; it was not AIG&amp;#039;s intent &amp;amp;quot;to enter into the political arena at all.&amp;amp;quot; Jim Crain stated that he did understand that Sharia is viewed as a political ideology, and commented &amp;amp;quot;that is becoming more apparent as the days go on.&amp;amp;quot; (I would conclude from this that I was not the first person who has called Jim Crain about this.) He stated that &amp;amp;quot;it is entirely possible&amp;amp;quot; that the public is going to think that AIG is taking a political position that is pro-Sharia. Jim Crain concluded our discussion by stating &amp;amp;quot;I am going to pass your concerns on to our senior management and legal.&amp;amp;quot;       Now it is your turn. American taxpayers own $40 billion worth of AIG stock. This is your company and your responsibility to contact AIG about both its Sharia finance businesses and its efforts now to promote Sharia-based insurance in the United States.       Let AIG&amp;#039;s Jim Crain know that the calls he has gotten thus far complaining about AIG&amp;#039;s Sharia based business is the tip of the iceberg. Jim Crain&amp;#039;s phone number and email address are provided on the AIG press release to discuss AIG&amp;#039;s Sharia-based Takaful Homeowners Policy. Let him know precisely what you think of it as a shareholder in AIG, and ask Jim Crain to make certain that his senior management also is aware of your concerns as well.       Sign our online petition demanding that the Federal Reserve, Securities Exchange Commission, and Department of Treasury carry out their fiduciary responsibilities under H.R. 1424 to act as the Financial Stability Oversight Board in America&amp;#039;s interest - and demand that AIG divest itself now of its Sharia businesses. This is an opportunity to make American commitment to human rights a part of how companies do business in America. It is our responsibility to let AIG know our concerns.       Let&amp;#039;s make our voices heard on this outrage, just as we would if AIG was offering a white supremacist financial products, black supremacist financial products, or any other products or services linked to a supremacist ideology. We need to make our voices heard because supremacism is fundamentally against the inalienable human rights of equality and liberty, as defined in America&amp;#039;s Declaration of Independence... and declaration of our identity as well. By the very definition of America, we are responsible for equality and liberty, and we are responsible for confronting Islamic supremacism.             -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       ACT for America    P.O.
