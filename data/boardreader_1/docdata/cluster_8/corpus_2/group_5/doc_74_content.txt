 I&amp;#039;d like to see a Citibank or AIG AVERAGE worker make the $73/hour with benefits that the &amp;#039;Big 3&amp;#039; assembly line workers make.....I&amp;#039;m anti-union mainly for the reason that if you get a job at a workplace that has a union you are required to be a part of it and they take you&amp;#039;re money without getting a choice.....As far as I&amp;#039;m concerned, unions are basically just people who get to throw fits if they don&amp;#039;t get the money they want.....&amp;#039;I want a $1/hr raise each year or we&amp;#039;ll strike!&amp;amp;quot;.......Why would most employers want to have unions in their businesses if this is what will happen.....
