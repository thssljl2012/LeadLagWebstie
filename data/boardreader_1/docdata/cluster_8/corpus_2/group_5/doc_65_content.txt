This is why I think that these companies need to go through Chapter 11 in order to thoroughly clean out the rot that exists in these neanderthal companies. Taxpayer bailouts will only postpone the inevitable because the companies won't be motivated to change. It's like giving someone an additional credit card because they can't live within their means and want to maintain their current lifestyle. It simply doesn't work.                      So, I guess the the US government made a mistake by bailing out the cause of the problem, the banks and AIG ? At this point in time, no amount of &amp;quot;restructuring&amp;quot; will help when the market for goods has stalled. What we are talking about here is bridge financing. The US government gave $25 biilion to the Bank of America, which neither needed or wanted it. They will make a tidy profit from it and return it in a few years. The option to refuse the &amp;quot;loan&amp;quot; was not there; it was forced upon them because of their size. The fact of the matter is that the Detroit 3 have been addressing the changing market for vehicles for a number of years. GM plants are among the most efficient assembly plants in NA and South America according to the Harbor Report. If you take into account that they are still doing far more of the actual assembly than the import assembly plants, it demonstrates a higher level of efficiency.
