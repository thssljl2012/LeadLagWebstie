I haven't used traveller cheques since my last trip to Europe in the early 90's.  I use my Bank of America debit card to withdraw cash from a Bank of America ATM.  Since it's a BofA ATM, there's no fee.  I usually withdraw $100 as I need it.  There's an ATM near the Downtown Disney hotels on Apopka-Vineland Road (Crossroads Shopping Center).  We use this one when we are at WDW.  When we are at Universal Studios, we use the BofA ATM on Sand Lake Road, just west of the I-Drive intersection.  When I run out of cash, I'll use my Disney VISA credit card.  And I never use my debit card for purchases when travelling.  I only use it in a BofA ATM.
