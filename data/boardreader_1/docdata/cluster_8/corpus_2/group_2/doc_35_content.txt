I was interested at the option of an eCheque from my Barclays current account. Would that carry such a large currency conversion charge from my bank?     I can also choose to have my own credit card company make the currency exchange instead of paypal, but what kind of percentage would they charge? I have a handful of cards barclaycard (visa), sky card (mastercard), tesco card (mastercard)  Would I get a better deal choosing that option? If so, would I be better off with one card over another?        Also I wanted to just use this smiley because I&amp;#039;m new here and it&amp;#039;s awesome.                        Your other cards will charge you 2.75%.
