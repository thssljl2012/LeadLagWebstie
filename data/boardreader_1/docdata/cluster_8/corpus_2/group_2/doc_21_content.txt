ROBERT SCHEER: I would point out, you have asked the question about covering foreign banks. One of those foreign banks, UBS, Swiss bank, is where Phil Gramm works. He was rewarded after being head of the Banking Committee, pushing through this deregulation. His wife Wendy Gramm went to work for Enron, was on their audit committee. She runs a big institute for deregulation that the big corporations put a lot of money into. Phil Gramm went to work for UBS, a foreign-based banking conglomerate. And now they want to extend this coverage to those banks. These people have no shame.          I think its time, as I said before, to really talk about criminal investigation. They have defrauded the American people, and they changed the laws. You know the old folk song, Woody Guthrie, I guess, you know, some will rob you with a gun, and others with a fountain pen. I mean, imagine, these people came in, rewrote federal regulation to exempt the kind of credit swapsI notice people find this a bit confusing, but Im saying theyve got to read up on it. The hybrid instruments that they talk about, thats what allowed all of this. Thats why AIG got in trouble. Theyre supposed to be selling insurance; theyre not supposed to be backing security packages. And all of this stuff was hidden, it was murky. The bankers themselves admit they dont know what was going on.          And all of that was made legal; it was illegal up until, you know, less than ten years ago. It was made legal by acts of Congress, led by the Republicans, and unfortunately a majority of Democrats backed it, and Bill Clinton signed off on that first major legislation. So we have to be very wary            JUAN GONZALEZ: Bob Scheer, the amazing irony now is, as we read in some of the papers today, that the very firms that were involved in creating this crisis are now lining up in Washington to be able to become managers, in case the federal government buys up this debt, and then it needs to manage how it will get rid of the debt, so that the very firms are now lining up to become the money managers of the distressed debt that the government buys.            ROBERT SCHEER: Right. What youve got here is really the end of the Reagan Revolution. And I hate to bring up the bad F word, but, you know, there is a model for this, and Mussolini had it in Italy, and its called fascism. Its where your big corporate interests throw in with government, destroy the freedom of the rest of the people, and preserve their power. Everybody forgets, private corporations and banks did quite well, made out quite well in Italy and Germany in those days, you know? And I am really worried about this assault on our democracy.             The ideawe didnt cover insurance, as Sanders pointed out, insurance for four million kids, because Bush vetoed it and said $7 billion was too much to spend to cover insurance, health insurance, for four million kids, but now they can throw $700 billion at these banks, and they say we cant even have hearings about it. It is absolutely outrageous!           And I dont want to lose that point I made earlier. The best way to deal with this crisis now is to put a freeze on foreclosures. Thats what the Democrats should beits what Hillary mentioned during the primaries. I dont know if she did it just as a one-liner. But the fact is, its a very reasonable thing to do, say American homeowners should not suffer now, you know, if people were given these mortgages. And, by the way, its not just the subprime mortgage holders that hurt; if the housing market collapses, as it has, it hurts everyone. Why not a freeze on foreclosures? And why are the Democrats not pushing that idea?          Lets help out the people who are suffering, you know, and the working people, middle-class people, poor people, who have these homeits their whole assetinstead of worrying about saving Goldman Sachs and saving Citigroup. And its amazing to me that a guy like Paulson could have been head of Goldman Sachshe knew this was all going onRobert Rubin was head of Goldman Sachs; they go into the government, and now theyre going to bail out their former companies, and we have to pay for it? I mean, its outrageous!
