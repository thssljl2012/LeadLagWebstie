  i was thinking about it and i think the fairest thing is for the US Government in some form to buy the houses in foreclosure and rent them out and sell them over time like they did with RTC. Don&amp;#039;t even need a new RTC since we already own Fannie, freddie, AIG and the government&amp;#039;s own mortgage insurance agencies      or just forget the bailout and authorize the SS fund to temporarily invest in short term corporate bonds so people won&amp;#039;t be laid off and companies that had nothing to do with the housing bubble aren&amp;#039;t going crazy trying to find financing
