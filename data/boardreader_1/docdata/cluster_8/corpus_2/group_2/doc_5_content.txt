They buy these insurance packages from little guys like Allstate, Geico, etc. As the little guys sell these already written insurances packages to AIG, they&amp;#039;d get money to live and provide more insurances. If there&amp;#039;s no auto insurances, you can&amp;#039;t drive and when you get hurt, no one pays hospital. If there&amp;#039;s no home insurance, your mortage would go up VERY high, like many hundreds of dollars, or you need very big down payments. In any case, you and I lose. It&amp;#039;s not about AIG. It&amp;#039;s about us.     You&amp;#039;re an idiot and a fascist. AIG could easily sell their insurance business since it&amp;#039;s a cash cow.   Just admit it. You and everyone on here (like &amp;#039;conservative republican&amp;#039;) who is so sure that this is Clinton and Carter&amp;#039;s fault, and hates welfare normally but just this once, since it&amp;#039;s going to bail out corporations and give huge new powers to the Bush administration, you will support it....You are fascists in the same vein as Benito. You are advocating more than just &amp;#039;corporate welfare&amp;#039;, you want to merge the power of the government and corporations. You, just like a welfare queen wants her food stamps, want the government to take care of you and major corporations that made bad decisions.  Look at you, you&amp;#039;ve posted 10 times already supporting this but saying it&amp;#039;s Clinton&amp;#039;s fault. Sick. Where has Bush been? Where has Bernake and Paulson been? They were telling us everything was fine just a month ago!   It&amp;#039;s funny to see how quickly the closet fascist in some of you comes out. You may call yourself republicans but you are not conservative.
