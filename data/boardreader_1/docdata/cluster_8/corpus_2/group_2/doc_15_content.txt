They will have much more clout than what you can muster from a heated phone call, especially since their more than happy to set their legal team on just about anyone if there not willing to refund for an item you&amp;#039;ve sent back. (usually need proof that you&amp;#039;ve sent the item back)      As for the additional charges they have charged you to not fix something, again do the same and tell your credit card company it is an unauthorised transaction. You&amp;#039;ll be credited your money back while they battle with the company to sort things out.      Not sure how well this works with a standard debit / bank card. But i&amp;#039;ve had really good responces in three instances where companies refused to refund, or charged me for services I was not happy with. (card is with Barclays)         I&amp;#039;m about to try the whole &amp;amp;quot;charge dispute&amp;amp;quot; thing with my credit card for an entirely unrelated charge that was put on my CC while I was on vacation. It&amp;#039;s only 15, but I&amp;#039;m using it as a test case to see how easy it is. Unfortunately, it was probably about 7-8 years ago when I had this run-in with OCUK... I was too young to have a credit card and I doubt there&amp;#039;s much protection for debit card owners. It was also stated in their T&amp;amp;amp;Cs that they could charge for an RMA which they felt was unwarranted. Live and learn.
