           ^^^^ quick replies thanks    Russ...so say other credit companies or for example mobile companies, when they do a search on me when applying for credit, will they see my existing bank account in my old name when i first opened the account...or my bank account in my new name.    if they see my old name with my bank account...can i ask Barclays to close the account under my old name when i first opened it...then allow me to open up a new account fresh with my new name just to put my mind at rest?    Ive just registered on the annual canvass thingy should be up and running by December...also after it has been updated how long will it then take agency&amp;#039;s to see that i am on the register?
