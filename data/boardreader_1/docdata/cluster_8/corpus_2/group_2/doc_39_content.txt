Regardless, they have certainly sold more units than the Spire.  Waterview has been a very poorly managed project from the get go, and the Spire, by most indications, has been much better about not spending money they don&amp;#039;t have, but they have had their own problems as well.  I agree that it may take awhile longer, but it will be completed.                      Ok thanks. I do agree the Spire will be completed. The Waterview is looking bleak. They were looking for credit insurance from AIG. I am pretty sure that is not going to happen now!      It might just end up being the hotel that was planned without many, if not all of the condos.
