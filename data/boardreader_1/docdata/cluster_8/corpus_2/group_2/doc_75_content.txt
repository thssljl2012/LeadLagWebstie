They won&amp;#039;t currently up my limit and am thinking of getting another card.     I have been living in the Uk for a little over 2 years at the same address.   I have not had problems with my current card and pay the amount off in full every month.  I&amp;#039;m in full time employment.  I don&amp;#039;t have any debts.     When I look at the online applications however they always want to know what your address was prior if you have not been living there for 3 years. Obviously I was living in another country and they don&amp;#039;t really provide the appropriate space to explain this.      Does anyone know a way around this that I would be able to apply for a second card? Or are there institutions who will have an easier process for application?     Any advice would be great!                      HI,  When I was applying for a card and I didn&amp;#039;t live at the address for the needed period of time, I went to my bank and filled up a form they provided there - there was enough space to put my foreign address in. Failing that (if your bank IS Barclays who you already have card with), I think I recently say paper application for HSBC and there was also enough space for foreign address.  Are you on electroral roll?  have you seen your credit report? Go on Experian and check whether they hold your previous foreign address. That might help to avoid getting declined for incomplete previous address, as as long as you put the basics of the address like the town, country and post code, they will compare it with your file and see you are not making it up.
