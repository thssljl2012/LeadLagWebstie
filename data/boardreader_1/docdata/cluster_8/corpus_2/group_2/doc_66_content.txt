 Guys as promised here is a list of my creditors...     1. Cooperative Bank 12,811  2. Barclays Bank 12,700  3. Cahoot 7,057  4. Link Financial 4,522  5. Hfc Bank 1,934  6. CL Finance 540  7. Collect Direct 529  8. Capital One 500  9. Mbna Europe 464  10. Argos Card 376  11. Barclaycard 277  12. Royscot Financial 174     Total debt is 41,894        How much would I be looking at offering these guys in settlements via F+F payments?     Would really appreciate an idea of how much to save and how much to distribute between each creditor, if someone could be so kind as to help.     At the moment I have saved 2500, so heading in the right direction I think.     Anyone...?
