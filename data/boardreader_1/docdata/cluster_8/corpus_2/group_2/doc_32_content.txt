 Yeah, if the policy was only a month old, then that is stupid ... and I&amp;#039;m not sure that cancelling it is even allowed.       If they bound the coverage, and accepted your premium, then there are only a few specific cases where the insurer can cancel the policy before the end of the policy term, and nearly all of those would have to involve misrepresentation/fraud/nonpayment of premium on your part. You may want to check with your state DOI.       Unless there&amp;#039;s something in your policy that allows the insurer to cancel in the first 30 days for any reason......
