I planned to sign up to the virgin card to get the 10% discount in stores to replace the Egg.     I don&amp;#039;t think I would be able to have the four credit cards on the go, and I really don&amp;#039;t think my credit would support this too, I&amp;#039;d be surprised if I can get the Virgin.     Specifically as I had a MBNA card as a balance transfer card two years ago and was warned on cancellation my credit will be messed up for 10 years if I do (normally credit cards cancellations departments offer you deals to keep you on, this guy tried the threatening scare tactics approach so cancelled it immediately after this  ).     It would be better if I could get Halfix or Barclays to match it as I feel I have been a very good customer to them.                      obviously your decision but egg money is a good card... 1% cashback on everything and a useful &amp;#039;mule&amp;#039; card for BT&amp;#039;s if needed
