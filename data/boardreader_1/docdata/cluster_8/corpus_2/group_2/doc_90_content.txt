 The government is desperately trying to stave off a complete economic crash before the election is safely secured/stolen and they&amp;#039;ve installed their latest glove puppets &amp;#039;The penguin&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;The pitbull&amp;#039; into the Oval office. If the economy went completely down the shitter it would be incredibly hard to persuade the masses once again that it&amp;#039;s gone down to the wire on a 51/49 % vote. Esp if the exit polls are 80/20% in Obamas favour. Ultimately it&amp;#039;s not their money and they have no intention of paying any of it back, so what do they honestly care? As long as it allows them to get their heads in the trough of political power for another 4 years it&amp;#039;s all gravy in their eyes.
