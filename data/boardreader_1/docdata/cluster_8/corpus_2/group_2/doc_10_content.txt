 Couple of thoughts; AIG through it&amp;#039;s ILFC subsidiary provides aircraft and insurance to a shit load of airlines.  If it goes under, people aren&amp;#039;t flying anywhere for a while.    Also was reading this interesting blurb:     Commentary: Five things that will be different after the &amp;#039;bailout&amp;#039;     I think we need to pay more attention to the 1st point.  The reason governments don&amp;#039;t generally print more money willy nilly is because it leads to inflation; if we&amp;#039;re gonna pull 700 billion bucks out of thin air, that&amp;#039;s going to come home to roost in the not so distant future.
