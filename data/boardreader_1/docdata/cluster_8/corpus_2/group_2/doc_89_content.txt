 i agree with the concept of nationalization of the means of production in our company.  so much of our economy is tied to the broad financial companies that to have more and more of them controlled by our most inefficient government just scares the crap outta me.      puck, while price has already answered the mechanism of the &amp;amp;quot;bail-out&amp;amp;quot; the deeper question was why do they need it anyway.  well, as the WORLD&amp;#039;s largest insurer it has claims paying responsibilities.  a hurricane (or two or three) just swept through the country and tonnes of folks expect their claims to be paid FROM AIG.  people died today that had life insurance policies FROM AIG.  people have annuities they are using for income in retirement that are FROM AIG.        while it would be nice to have the money you need to pay these claims, if you have a short term money crunch (like three hurricanes), it is nice to be able to take on a short term loan to cover your client needs.  AIG had so over leveraged itself that not only was there insufficient cash reserves, but they couldnt go borrow any money cause no CORPORATE lender wants to lend money it might not get back.      AIG should have died.  it woulda cleaned out the pipes.  we coulda started some type of recovery.  they poorly (hmmmm, they criminally) mismanaged their business.  that sucks, but the wages of sin is death.  i just hope if i do something monumentally stupid and my company fails, Uncle Sam is willing to throw me a few million to keep me in business.      what a shame!
