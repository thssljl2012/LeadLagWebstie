Despite that though, you&amp;#039;d be amazed how much money there is to be made out there. A lot of people out there saw the signs coming. I mean AIG is leveraged damn near 11:1. How in the hell can an insurance company justify that? They simply got too greedy in their expansion although the smartest move they made in that was picking up ILFC. Hazy is a beast and that company will always be solid with him around. But even in banking, those who weren&amp;#039;t foolhardy in their lending with subprimes and interest only (I say foolheardy btu unfortunately predatory also applies in many instances) are reaping rewards. My father&amp;#039;s bank hasn&amp;#039;t had any additional writeoffs because he wouldn&amp;#039;t mess with any of that and now he is in a position to buy out another bank and possibly even a second to gain new regional marketshare. And the amount he has made in the market just this week is pretty staggering. If you know what you&amp;#039;re doing, this is a great time to be making money.
