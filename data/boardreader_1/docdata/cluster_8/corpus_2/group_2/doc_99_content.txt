   No don&amp;#039;t do it ! I know a two AA97 agents that did (went to AFC) and came back and did get a bigger book but had to take the current contract and they both really regret it. You got the best deal these days stick with it. We 2004 and 2005 agents would jump for joy if we were put on your contract. You see the older agents never thought the 97 was a good deal and maybe it wasn&amp;#039;t compared to their 34 deal but the 97 is looking like a sweeet deal compared to the current contract.        Word in my region is also AFC coming back to &amp;amp;quot;personal production&amp;amp;quot; are not getting the 3000-4000 car books they are getting more like 2300 and hoping the block that was assigned out will return to their agencies.         I know an agent that just started had 1700 cars &amp;amp;amp; 900 fire from a split book and AFC just took the other part. The new agent a few months after starting has 900 cars and 500 fire as the AFC kept all the previous staff and building and a smart move on their part but they new agent has about 1/2 what he started with and the company does nothing. Please talk to 10 agents that were hired in 2004 and 2005 before considering a position with this company. They do have a better deal for new agents then we had but in the end you will still have the current contract which pays you 30% of the illustrations we were shown.

If you don&amp;#039;t follow the party line there, you really aren&amp;#039;t going anywhere. The only way it is worth it is if you think you can hack it for a few years and then go back into production with a really large assignment. That doesn&amp;#039;t always work out.     I&amp;#039;ve been approached several times and can&amp;#039;t find any reason why it would be worth doing it.
