 I have AMEX  and was considering Barclays with 4&amp;amp;#37; CBack - but that offer is finishing and reverts to 0.5% - so no good   Therefore which is  next best from,  Shell MasterCard from Citi ,ASDA and Halifax which is 2%CB  I reckon with  3%CB on fuel and 1% other purchases  Shell MasterCard from Citi  is best bet- or are there there others- MBNA Platunum Rewards?
