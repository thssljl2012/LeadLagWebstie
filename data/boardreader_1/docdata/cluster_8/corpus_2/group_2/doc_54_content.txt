   I don&amp;#039;t know the details of the impact of the CRA, but assume that it had a measurable influence&amp;amp;nbsp; on the market. The most pernicious thing, imo, is the separation of risk from the chance of profit. The insurance of these mortgages made prudent judgment passe, as there was no consequence to the lender if the loans defaulted.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  AIG, FNMA and FMAC were derelict in approving insurance in a helluva lot of cases where a cursory examination would have shown that the borrower had not a chance in hell of repaying the loan.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Jim B
