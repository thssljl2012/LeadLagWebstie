 New Orleans wasn&amp;#039;t founded on land below sea-level. The areas affected by Katrina were more recent settlements, built in the last 100 years on drained swamps. The older parts, where I live, were fine during Katrina. No flooding at all. The French Quarter had no flooding at all. When they first founded New Orleans, there were no such thing as man-made levees. There were no mechanized water pumps. They built the city in the best damn place possible.      As the city grew they started building houses in more and more precarious spots. Not even raised off of the ground. The smart people who rebuilt after Katrina rebuilt their houses on stilts with a garage underneath.       There is a huge controversy in our town about rising insurance rates(and I&amp;#039;m sure this has affected people nationwide as well). People who live in the areas that don&amp;#039;t flood don&amp;#039;t want people to be able to get homeowners insurance, unless they build there house on raised ground or stilts to get ABOVE SEA LEVEL.      It seems elementary but there are a lot of dumbasses. I&amp;#039;ve seen so many new houses built after Katrina that are just asking for another flood to fuck them up.      Not everyone in New Orleans is an idiot, and it&amp;#039;s a great place for a city.
