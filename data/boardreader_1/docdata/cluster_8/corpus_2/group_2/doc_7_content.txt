  I hope your friends get sorted out soon - it&amp;#039;s not a pleasant situation to be in.     I got caught in the CottonTraders hacking incident, and my Barclays debit card was used to purchase a bed from a firm in Telford to be delivered to a South London address.  Luckily the site owner had had a string of suspicious puchases and didn&amp;#039;t process the order, but managed to contact me to warn me.  As I had just moved, the transaction wouldn&amp;#039;t have gone through, but it was still scarey.      Good luck to your friends.
