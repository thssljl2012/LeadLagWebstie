 Set the groups up with an ACL that denies Marimba the ability to delete   them. Maybe their error checking is as bad as the rest of their AD coding   and it will just reuse the existing group then...       --   O&amp;#039;Reilly Active Directory Third Edition -   http://www.joeware.net/win/ad3e.htm      -----Original Message-----   From: ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org   &amp;amp;#91mailto:ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org&amp;amp;#93 On Behalf Of Sabharanjak, Ravi   BGI SF   Sent: Tuesday, August 26, 2008 8:56 PM   To: ActiveDir@mail.activedir.org   Subject: &amp;amp;#91ActiveDir&amp;amp;#93 Posible OT: Active Directory and BMC-Marimba   collections    Hello all,    We have an application called Marimba castanet, bought over by BMC that we   use for deploying software. Marimba has a feature called collections, by   which it builds and populates AD groups with computer accounts using certain   criterion about the computers that it evaluates against an inventory   database. The collections are then used to target the computers in the   groups for software installation.     An issue we are running into is that every time the collections update, the   application deletes the previously created groups and creates fresh ones.   This is resulting into a lot of deleted items in our directory, as we need   to run these collections fairly frequently. This also causes a lot of   replication traffic and even breaks replication once a while (although SP2   on the DC&amp;#039;s has reduced this a lot).    Has anyone run into a similar issue if they are running Marimba integrated   with their AD?
