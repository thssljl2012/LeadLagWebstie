 Basicaly you have a debt(mortgage) and &amp;amp;quot;offset&amp;amp;quot; savings against them.     The one account and other CAM syle offsets keep it in one pot like a big overdraft     Traditional offsets use a mortgage account and savings pots, some also offset cuurent accounts, some also ISA&amp;#039;s.     With them all you just pay interest on the net borrowings.     For most the savings would earn less than the interest on a mortgage so it is worth doing as an option if you have spare cash and do not want to invset elsewhere say equities,gold,     Others that can find an offset usefull are those with cash flow issues the offset is a great place to keep buffer funds.     One great thing about an offset arrangment over just paying more on the mortgage is that it is easy to get the money back so great way to save up for things, but you have to be disiplined not to just spend, also you are not commiting to the extra payments have a bad month want to go out more just save less.     Good budget/planning and tracking is recommended as part of an offset plan.     As a teacher you have good pension cover allready so your alternative savings are regular savings, ISA&amp;#039;s, definately consider using your cash ISA allowances in full as part of this MFW plan.     I think currently the First direct offering is about the best, but the Barclays allow ISA&amp;#039;s to be offset so you can build up these at the same time, allthough just saving in the best available ISA is OK since the rates are about the same as a mortgage anyway     Beware of any of the calculators or offerings that make out they are doing something magic, you are doing all the work by overpaying and that is what is making the morgage get paid off earlier.
