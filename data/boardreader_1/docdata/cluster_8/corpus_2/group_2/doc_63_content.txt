Back then every grad was offered a six figure salary and the opportunity to make huge money.  Well, he graduated with honors and can&amp;#039;t find a job.                        6 figures on Wall St is chump change. There are more in serious trouble. They are laying off thousands and thousands on Wall St. Another firm is cutting 9-22 a ton of jobs.
