What makes you think that capitalism doesn't apply to the banking industry the same way it does to the auto industry?  There is no such thing as too big to fail.  Thank my lucky stars indeed!  The only people that got bailed out by the bank bailouts were the shareholders.  58% of the 180 BILLION AIG bailout went to pay off insurance contracts to banks overseas, and we're busy worrying about 170 million in bonuses!!!  Why were they a systemic risk again???     I'll tell you what's a systemic risk.  A governtment that has to pay 1.4 billion dollars a day in interest on the national debt!!!  A govt. that thinks the rest of the world will continue to loan them money in perpetuity, while they set about destroying the value of the dollar.  In case you missed it recently when they essentially announced they were going to print a trillion dollars to pay for supposedly "saving me from financial collapse".  If their is a financial collapse it will be because of the bailouts not the other way around.  If the Government inflates the dollar by printing money demand for our debt will dry up, because nobody wants to loan money that will be worth less when they pay it back.  Then the goverment's only option will be to pay for more bailouts by printing money, further destroying the value of the dollar.     The government wants us to think deflation is what we should be worried about???  Deflation is the natural result of gains in productivity.  Oh how our computer industry has suffered at the hands of falling pc prices.       I have to end this rant before I go off the deep end.  I suggest you all go out and buy a copy of Meltdown by Thomas Woods, stop falling for the governemnt's BS, and get angry at the real culprits for this mess, so you can all join me in voting them out of office.
