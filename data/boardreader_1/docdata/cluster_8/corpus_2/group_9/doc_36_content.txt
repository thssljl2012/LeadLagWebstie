         Look I'm not going to take the time to list all 100 mistakes. He has made more then 100 in his quest to run America into the ground and make them equal partners to Third World dung heeps.  I will throw up a few and then link the others. I suggest all Obama cultists who drank the kook aid read each accusation carefully and then join me in fighting this anti-America, pro-Amerika Socialist, old Chicago political hack.            Quote:      1. "Obama criticized pork barrel spending in the form of 'earmarks,' urging changes in the way that Congress adopts the spending proposals. Then he signed a spending bill that contains nearly 9,000 of them, some that members of his own staff shoved in last year when they were still members of Congress. 'Let there be no doubt, this piece of legislation must mark an end to the old way of doing business, and the beginning of a new era of responsibility and accountability,' Obama said." -- McClatchy, 3/11  2. "There is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments." -- Obama during the campaign.  3. This year's budget deficit: $1.5 trillion.  4. Asks his Cabinet to cut costs in their departments by $100 million -- a whopping .0027%!  5. "The White House says the president is unaware of the tea parties." -- ABC News, 4/15  6. "Mr. Obama is an accomplished orator but is becoming known in America as the 'teleprompt president' over his reliance on the machine when he gives a speech." -- Sky News, 3/18  7. In early February, the 2010 census was moved out of the Department of Commerce and into the White House, politicizing how federal aid is distributed and electoral districts are drawn.  8. Obama taps Nancy Killefer for a new administration job, First Chief Performance Officer -- to police government spending. But it surfaces that Killefer had performance issues of her own -- a tax lien was slapped on her DC home in 2005 for failure to pay unemployment compensation tax on household help. She withdrew.  9. Turkey tried to block the appointment of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as new NATO secretary general because he didn't properly punish the Danish cartoonist who caricatured Mohammed. France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany's Angela Merkel were outraged; Obama said he supported Turkey's induction into the European Union.  10. . . . and he never mentioned the Armenian genocide.  11. The picture of Obama and Hugo Chavez shaking hands.  12. Hugo Chavez gave him the anti-American screed "The Open Veins of Latin America." Obama didn't remark upon it. At least it wasn't DVDs.    13. Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega went on a 50-minute anti-American rant, calling Obama "president of an empire." Obama didn't leave the room. "I thought it was 50 minutes long. That's what I thought," he said.  14. Executives at AIG get $165 million in bonuses, despite receiving an $173 billion taxpayer bailout.  15. "For months, the Obama administration and members of Congress have known that insurance giant AIG was getting ready to pay huge bonuses while living off government bailouts. It wasn't until the money was flowing and news was trickling out to the public that official Washington rose up in anger and vowed to yank the money back." -- Associated Press, 3/18  16. "After pushing Congress for weeks to hurry up and pass the massive $787 billion stimulus bill, President Obama promptly took off for a three-day holiday getaway." -- New York Post, 2/15  17. MEGHAN CLYNE ON: "I WON" AND THE DEATH OF BIPARTISANSHIP  "Obama soared to victory on the hopeful promise of a new era of bipartisanship. During his inaugural address he even promised an 'end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.'  "Too bad it took all of three days for the promise to ring hollow.  "Start with Obama's big meeting with top congressional leaders on his signature legislation -- the stimulus -- on the Friday after his inauguration. Listening to Republican concerns about overspending was a nice gesture -- until he shut down any hopes of real dialogue by crassly telling Republican leaders: 'I won.' Even the White House's leaking of the comment was a slap at the Republican leadership, who'd expected Obama to adhere to the custom of keeping private meetings with congressional leadership, well, private.  "It's only gone downhill from there. The stimulus included zero Republican recommendations, and failed to get a single House Republican vote.             Messiah has 100 mistakes in 100 days.
