"the markets are totally corrupt"    Not totally, but highly. Accounting is pathetic and the SEC spineless. Zerohedge has a good series going now about the banks underwriting new issues for REITs with the sole purpose of paying back the banks on their LOCs. Of course these deals have been met with upgrades by said bank analysts.      "investors didn't take the money out of the market, it was stolen"    Stolen is a bit tough, but surely snookered out of their money.     "the Treasury and the Fed are printing money to pay for the phoney [sic] insurance"    Inflation targeting is certainly theft from savers and AIG has clearly been a cost to taxpayers.     "The taxpayer now owns 80% of a criminal enterprise"    Although no charges, i'm fine with this claim as well. They've at least been guilty of financial engineering to make reserves look healthier in the past. And their stated book value seems to have been borderline criminal given how much money they need.     "the relief given is being stolen from our children"    Agree... although I just sent in a healthy tax check myself. :(     "Mainstream media is ignoring the corruption"    Mostly agree. One can find much better coverage via blogs.      "The gutless and worthless Congressmen are  sitting on their hands while all this plays out because they are beholding [sic] to Dick and Hank"    Congress is def gutless, stupid and or captured by wall street.   msg 34753
