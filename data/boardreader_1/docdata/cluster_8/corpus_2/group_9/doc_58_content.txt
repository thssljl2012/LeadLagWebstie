In an unprecedented move, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson had threatened to fire CEO of Bank of America Ken Lewis, if he not only  move ahead with a merger with Merrill Lynch despite reservations, but also stay quiet about the mounting losses at the crumbling investment bank.   Yeah, that&#039;s right, Federal officials under Bush&#039;s administration threatened to fire the head of a private bank if he didn&#039;t move ahead with the merger AND stay quiet about Merrill&#039;s finances.   Talk about the epitome of socialism! You&#039;d think this type of stuff only happens in central China. For crying out loud!    The Bush cronies never cease to amaze me.   Why aren&#039;t the right wingers complaining about this?   Had Obama done this, they would&#039;ve been up in arms!...hypocrites!       http://www.usnews.com/blogs/the-ticker/2...
