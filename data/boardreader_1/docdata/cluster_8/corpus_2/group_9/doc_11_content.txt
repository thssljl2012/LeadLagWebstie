You want to read this one close. Shareholders are going to have a heyday with this.                      "Notably, during Bank of Americas important communications with federal banking officials in late December 2008, the lone federal agency charged with protecting investor interests, the Securities and Exchange Commission, appears to have been kept in the dark. Indeed, Secretary Paulson informed this Office that he did not keep the SEC Chairman in the loop during the discussions and negotiations with Bank of America in December 2008."      Surely there's a law against this.  Surely Paulson can be jailed for this behavior.
