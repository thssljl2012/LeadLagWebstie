                                                                                                                 Damned cursed despot with a zombie                         wife....                                                          Citibank                                                           2.94                             -0.71                           -19.45%                                                          Letting his addicted daughter                         in law and cronies gamble away the people's hard earned money and                         in so doing, destroying the Singapore economy.                                                           Citibank, after all that sharp                         rise in the stock markets, is still below the price they converted                         into common stock. Citibank is the counter that they last bought                         (the lowest of all their investments the last two years) and they                         are suffering such massive looses on it.                                                              Imagine what the losses are like for the rest of                         their gambles!!!! Singaporeans earn money to let them                         gamble!!!                                                                                                                                               Damned cursed despot with a zombie                         wife....
