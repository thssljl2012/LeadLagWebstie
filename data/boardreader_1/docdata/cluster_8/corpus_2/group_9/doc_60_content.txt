B-Rock: "Mission Accomplished"          Amazing isn't it? That Obama could be responsible for a merger that took place on September 14, 2008, just shy of two months before the election? It was approved on Dec 5, 2008 and became effective on January 1st, 2009, three weeks before he took office.      Yeah and the Obama transition team was for it. All you have to do is look at Obama selecting Geithner.    Geither, Paulson, and Bernarke have no business being in government or in economics/business at this point.
