        QUOTE (Duty Honor Country &#064; Apr 26 2009, 04:18 AM)       People with an attention span longer than yours    --And that's fine if they don't already know those items.  #80 is incorrect, however. It says (in part) "Secretly forced Bank of America to buy Merrill Lynch, then allowed the bank to be criticized for overpaying." (IMG: http://www.rightnation.us/forums/style_emoticons/default/headscratch.gif )  That merger happened in September, didn't it? Obama wasn't the Resident yet, so how could he have played any part in that merger?  I thought it was a good move, so Obimi couldn't have been a part of that.

He's a radical bore.  And you already know I'm not "a liberal". In fact I'm just as conservative, or more conservative where it counts than you are. We are predominently a Christian Nation. I'll stick to watching Sean Hannity (who's been doing an excellent job), and whose show is watchable again since Colmes left. To each his own, k?
