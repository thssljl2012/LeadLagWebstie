 Both Communism and Fascism are social systems.  The difference is that, whereas the Government nationalizes industry, a la Hugo Chaves and Maxine Waters.....Fascism lets industry remain priovate WITH Government control!       Right now the government said it wants stock in banks....I think it now owns about 40% of Citibank stock....it's told GM's CEO to resign and how much money they can make.  They're dictating what Chrysler has to do.  Maybe Obama thinks what he's doing...if so, he has no idea the path he's set this country on!       We also have a Treasury Secretary who's a tax cheat.....the Asst. Sec. of Defense (and many others) are lobbiest's (so much for that promise) and no transparency!  Well, except that Obama appears to have shown his promises were transparent.       Obama in the first 100 days has increased the national deficit 4X more than Bush and Clinton in 4 16 years combined!!!!!!!!!!
