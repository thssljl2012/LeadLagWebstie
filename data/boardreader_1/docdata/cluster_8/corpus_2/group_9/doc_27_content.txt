        QUOTE (FS3 &#064; Apr 26 2009, 09:12 AM)       --And that's fine if they don't already know those items.  #80 is incorrect, however. It says (in part) "Secretly forced Bank of America to buy Merrill Lynch, then allowed the bank to be criticized for overpaying."  (IMG: http://www.rightnation.us/forums/style_emoticons/default/headscratch.gif )  That merger happened in September, didn't it? Obama wasn't the Resident yet, so how could he have played any part in that merger?  I thought it was a good move, so Obimi couldn't have been a part of that.     ---I watched him one time (for about 8 seconds). He's a radical bore.  And you already know I'm not "a liberal". In fact I'm just as conservative, or more conservative where it counts than you are. We are predominently a Christian Nation. I'll stick to watching Sean Hannity (who's been doing an excellent job), and whose show is watchable again since Colmes left. To each his own, k?   Sorry 3 but your past words say different, a Guiliani/McCain Liberal...just because they are Republican does not mean they are Conservative. Until you figure it out, you'll fall right in the Liberal Parade.
