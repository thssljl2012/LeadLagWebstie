btw, this was mentioned in yesterdays Bank of America conference call.    CRA = Community Reinvestment Act.  i.e. the Govt. forcing banks to loan to dead beats via Fannie/Freddie, which is Social Engineering.        Quote:    [In the course of Bank of America's] conference call, CFO Joe Price said the  CRA book accounts for 7% of the total in residential mortgages, but 24% of the losses .       Its not the only reason for this financial mess, but it is the Genesis and a huge source of why its spiraled so badly.
