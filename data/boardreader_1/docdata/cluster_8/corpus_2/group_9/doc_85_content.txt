I used to give the gov't and corporate America the benefit of the doubt. I don't any longer. If you tell me there are no conflicts of interest ALL OVER the place, I don't believe it. AIG's CEO has 3 million in Goldman Shares.    Paulson was CEO of Goldman, and Blankfein the current CEO was in the meeting at AIG with Geitner, Bernanke, and Paulson (WTF was a company CEO doing in that meeting) when AIG was given money to pay off its credit default swaps, that GS got 12 billion dollars of.    Corporate America via our Government is looting the taxpayer on a truly unprecedented level. It is absolutely disgusting.                               -------------------------            GTKeeper
