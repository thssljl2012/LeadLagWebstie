I cant wait until 30 years down the road when im watching about this on the history channel and all of the bullshit thats going on has come to light. Im sure there was much more of this shit that has happened.      I agree.  In the last year BoA bought two huge distressed companies-Countrywide Mortgage and Merrill Lynch.  Both deals were at the behest of the feds and both deals, in BoA's words at the time, supposedly tremendous bargains.  Purportedly BoA was solvent before it made those acquisitions-it certainly doesn't appear so now.    "Forced" acquisitions are certainly nothing new in the financial field-the FDIC does it just about every time a bank fails.  But in any type of acquisition the buyer has a period of "due diligence" to study the books of the target before the deal closes.  Here, and especially in ML's case, ML was wasting away its assets before the closing-with massive, early bonuses among other things.  BoA had to have known about that stuff.  In ordinary circumstances, the buyer would have walked.    Sometthing else went on, promises made, etc. that we don't know about yet, of that I am sure.    Incidentally, as I understand it these lawsuits don't claim these deals were illegal, just that BoA had a fiduciary duty to disclose all the adverse facts to its shareholders.  From the news stories I seen apparently BoA's President has testified in deposition that Bernanke and Paulson threatened to have him and the Board of Directors fired if they didn't close the deals.  Sounds to me like these company officials put their own personal interests over the interests of the company if that is the case.                               -------------------------            03/15/09 Former VP Cheney on America's economic collapse:  "Things happen."
