Funny Paper Simple.    China is doing everything it can to get rid of American Foreign Exchange for raw materials.     They are looking everywhere for folks with hard assets that will exchange them for dollars.The Stns are one locus, Russia, Iran, Brazil, Canada and Venezuela. They have it seems bypassed the Mexicans deliberately and I don't blame them.    They declared the U.S. dollar dying and in effect defunct at Davos although the US Press barely touched the subject.     It is sad but real our currency( faith and credit) is low. See "Tall Paul" Volker's recent statement about inflation and the irresponsibler behavior of the Federal Reserve. He, along with the St. Louis Fed, are honest in their assessment of the inflation picture and opposed to the current give away posture of the Bernanke/ Geithner mob. The integrity of our currency and behavior went out the window in the field of finance, like our Constitution after the stress of 9/11.    I am near to fully invested in hard asset equities as I do not trust our money. The fiscal flim flam is pervasive. Look at the Lewis/Bernanke/Paulson stories coming out of the basement regarding Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. Threats fraud and deceit.   msg 9001
