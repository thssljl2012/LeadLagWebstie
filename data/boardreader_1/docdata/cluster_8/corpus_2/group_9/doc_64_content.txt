   More of the Messiah Obama's own "moral bearings"....  The Messiah Obama was AIG Insurance Corporation's favorite candidate in the 2008 election.  This happened while the federal government had to bailout AIG from it's own mismanagement.  Did the Messiah Obama return the MILLIONS in contributions he received from AIG?  No way!!  Some "moral bearing", Messiah Obama!  LMAO!
