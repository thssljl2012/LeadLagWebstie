Common problem that is reguarly occuring now, all thanks to o2 and their superfast/supercheap deals.    I&amp;#039;ve changed to OpenDNS to combat the issues of bottle necking each evening which did improve my latency and slow downloads, yet tonight seems particulary bad...    I have heard that the exchanges will be upgraded by the 17/11 solving all problems but due to the crap speeds tonight (even on OpenDNS for some reason) I was checking the o2/Be forums and came across this;         Quote:                         Dear Member      Unfortunately you may have recently been subject to some service issues    which could have stopped you viewing certain websites.  This was a    result of DNS issues that we faced, specifically on the 4th and 6th of    this month.       Please accept our sincere apologies regarding this.  Previous to these    issues we had intended to transfer all our dynamic IP members,    (which includes yourself) over to our new DNS servers by the end of    November.         Due to the issues faced last night we immediately transferred a bulk of    our members over to our new servers, and will transfer the rest by mid    next week.       This won&amp;#039;t adversely affect your service in any way, and you do not    need to do anything. We are sure this will have a positive effect on    your service and for your reference the new DNS server numbers    are: 94.192.119.254 and 94.192.119.253.       Once again, please accept our sincere apologies and we thank you for    your patience.      Kind regards      The Be Team                     I tried changing my DNS on my box tonight but for some reason I kept getting errors, cba to keep trying right now so I&amp;#039;m leaving it for tonight. Not sure if this of any help to you K but for me the issue has been ongoing for the past 3-4 weeks.
