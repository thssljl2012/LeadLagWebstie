The commonwealth bank had a problem a few weeks back with not depositing peoples wages and pensions. At the end of the day,these things happen.We all know what computers are like. The thing is most are pretty peeved off with this,but its been since the 23rd october. I rang paypal on friday and was on the phone for 1 hour an 40 minutes,ended up talking to a supervisor,cos the guy who answered the call,couldnt answer me why i have to pay for a fee for deposits(yeh i know why just thought id ask) He said it was for the service. I stated what service if we havent got our money Any supervisor put me on hold oh for about 20 minutes,my phone went flat,and now i will call again monday morning phone fully charges. I am gonna demand i dont pay no fee,as i have enough trouble posting the items with no money
