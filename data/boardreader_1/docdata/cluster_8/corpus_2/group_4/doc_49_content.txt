Im not sure if this is the right section or not, but I&amp;#039;ll post it anyway.    When I try to register on the Barclays website so I can bank online, it asks me for my &amp;#039;3 digit security code&amp;#039;. I don&amp;#039;t even know what that is because at first I thought they meant my PIN but thats 4 digits. I clicked on help and it says;         Quote:                         Help with security code                     Enter the last three digits printed on the signature strip on the back of your Connect/Electron card. This is also known as the CVV or CVC.                                                                                                                                                             But there is no last 3 digits on the signature strip at all? Unless they mean my card number which ends in 005. I tried putting 005 in but it says it&amp;#039;s wrong. Any ideas? ;(
