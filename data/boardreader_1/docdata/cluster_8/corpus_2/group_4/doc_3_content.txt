@ FriendoftheDork: Running ANY useful specialists and fiddling around with the sliders until total science is equal would work (expressed non-hammer gains in gold because we have that variable anyway because of profits, upkeep etc).      If we aren&amp;#039;t running Representation we have no further use for non-resource farms... especially on food-poor maps we gain a LOT of potential commerce if we cottage them over.      It&amp;#039;s quite rare that the influx of food isn&amp;#039;t a huge benefit, although it might require a little readjustment of our economy and a lot of tile swapping.   If we cba or we have a map where more food doesn&amp;#039;t help too much, we could just skip Sushi and get Standard Ethanol instead which improves the commerce balance considerably without requiring many changes.      This assumes we really want to be ahead in economy and production... if we just want hammers we could also consider whip/draft cycles (with the Kremlin, Slavery is quite effective again) and still get a ridiculous boost to hammers for the gold we lose compared to State Property.
