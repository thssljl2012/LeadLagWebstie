I&amp;#039;d be pretty surprised to learn that the skills required to work in Bank of England were radically different than the skills required to be a senior exec at Barclays / Lloyds / Halifax etc. etc.       The idea that the people in charge of &amp;amp;quot;banks&amp;amp;quot; are stupid enough to get us into this mess - but the people in BoE are a whole different bunch and know what they&amp;#039;re doing - is a little hard for me to believe.      But maybe I&amp;#039;m just bitter. I have no debt, and apparently the benefit of that would be that my savings would now get more interest under my mattress.........
