 Not really that worried. We&amp;#039;ve just heard the banks are reducing the home loan interest by .08%, that&amp;#039;s after the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced the current official cash rate to 6%. That means our home repayments will reduce, but because we&amp;#039;re doing ok personally we can leave the repayment amount where it is and pay off more of the mortgage. You see, we foolproofed our mortgage by making sure we could cope with up to 12%.      On my shopping list are some crash bars, driving lights and a sump guard, as well as a new diff for the Jeep and perhaps a remote garage door opener! Not to mention re-cladding the fireplace in the house and doing some other interior renovations.      So, no, we&amp;#039;re not letting up, we&amp;#039;ll continue to spend what we need to improve our circumstances.      Mick
