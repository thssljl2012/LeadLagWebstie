   Judged:     1       AIG has always been unethical, it&amp;#039;s their culture. Arrogant Insurance Goons, They don&amp;#039;t care about their customers, they won&amp;#039;t pay out what they owe until they&amp;#039;ve collected years of interest on it - to the detriment of their clients. Ask any competitor, vendor, or client - and you will hear that it has always been that way....BTW, thought these giant salaries were going to go away?
