      I don&amp;#039;t agree @ all with the rationale of saying AIG failed outside of Insurance.  It&amp;#039;s like saying WAMU failed because people took out the deposits.  That&amp;#039;s like saying the reason why all these banks failed was due to their exposure in 1 particular investments. WTH for real.  Call it derivatives, investment modesl, gambling, big guys know it&amp;#039;s the same.  Literally man..        The world has not seen China/India flex its muscle, but guess what?  That 52 week high can be broken,  history can be made and written.  See why they are now growing, but the USA has stalled?  See why investors are outsourcing, adapting?  There are no guarantees, you don&amp;#039;t make the call no more.  You see the sentiment and ride the wave accordingly.        Our mortgage  busted too because of this, people are defaulting because of this. IMHO, it&amp;#039;s safe to say we are treading in water now because of past decisions.  Apparently, the creation of these instruments has lead us to FAIL !!  As we now see it.        The only way to find out if these injection would help, time will tell.  I believe it works only because the white collar crime.  But not in another decade, can we pull ourselves out.  It&amp;#039;s pathetic.  Trash green back.        Do you not see the ramifications though?  I&amp;#039;m sorry if people (not just you) see it as acceptable because it&amp;#039;s not.  I hope that my kids are holding green back and that its&amp;#039; recongized in the world, not some gold bullion or valdamir&amp;#039;s currency for that matter. _________________ SZ 11 - TIFFANY DIAMOND DUNK SB          http://www.solecollector.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=740812&amp;amp;amp;highlight=      -----------------------    &amp;amp;quot;I guess Im boring,&amp;amp;quot; Fox added. &amp;amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s nothing else to write about me because I don&amp;#039;t go to clubs or do drugs or fall out of cars drunk.&amp;amp;quot;    - Megan Fox
