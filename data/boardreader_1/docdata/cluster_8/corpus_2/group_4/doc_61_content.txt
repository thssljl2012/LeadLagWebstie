I would just write to Red saying that the debt is disputed due to a significant amount of excessive charges that have been added to the account...However your brother MUST start the process of reclaiming the charges + 8% compounded interest.    It might be a good idea for him/you to start a new thread in here for that particlar process -  http://www.consumeractiongroup.co.uk...barclays-bank/
