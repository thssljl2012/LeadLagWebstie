My point is that Australians cannot talk the credit markets into re-opening as they did not talk them into closing. Those in finance are telling me it won&amp;#039;t be until mid next year when results start coming in and that some sort of predictability will come back to the markets. That may open the banks to lend to each other and possibly others.
