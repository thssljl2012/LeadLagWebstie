Hi 42man,  Thanks for the quick reply.  I help him draft a letter this afternoon.  Should he say he disputes the debt because they&amp;#039;re excessice bank charges or becuase they&amp;#039;re illigal bank charges?  Is there a template letter for this on here?    The only reason he hasn&amp;#039;t tried to make a claim against Barclays was because he hasn&amp;#039;t actually paid them any money for the overdraft charges.  Can he still try and claim this money back though?  I will start a new thread as you&amp;#039;ve suggested.    Thanks  Aki
