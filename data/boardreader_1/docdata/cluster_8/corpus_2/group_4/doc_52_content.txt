Been with StGeorge for ages, not once had issues, the interest rate thing doesn&amp;#039;t even bother me.  I still think they&amp;#039;re the best, also helped when the mrs worked there (yay to 0.75% rate discount) and was chummy with then Gail Kelly CEO   , now the mrs is being eyed by BOQ, not sure I&amp;#039;m happy about that though.  I would gleefully recommend StG.
