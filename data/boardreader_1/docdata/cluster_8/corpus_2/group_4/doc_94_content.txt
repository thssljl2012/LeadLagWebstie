My daughter has zero concept of money, savings, chores, listening, doing anything she&amp;#039;s told or anything really, so you&amp;#039;re lucky there :P She gets given obscene amounts of Stuff every year so she doesn&amp;#039;t have to work for anything.      Her goals in life involves being a princess and buying a 3 storey house in Perth.      If I was actually going to save the money for her I&amp;#039;d get a managed fund of some description, CBA is as good as any. But like I said, the goal for next year is to somehow turn that $2k into a nice paid off house.
