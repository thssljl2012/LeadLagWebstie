 Deregulation.  If not for deregulated credit default swaps we wouldn&amp;#039;t be here.  The CDSs were issued specifically to bet against the mortgage backed securities and pay out in the case of default.  Defaults, in the form of foreclosures and bankruptcies, made the &amp;quot;investors&amp;quot; rich.  And we, in turn, get to bail out not only the banks but the largest insurance company in the world, AIG.  And we can look primarily to Phil Gramm as the instigator, but also to Clinton, Greenspan, Summers and Rubin as abettors.
