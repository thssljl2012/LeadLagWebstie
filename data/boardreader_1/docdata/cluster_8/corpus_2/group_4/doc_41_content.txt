                                                                                        if i didn&amp;#039;t prove you wrong then where&amp;#039;s the evidence obama wants to give money to those who don&amp;#039;t work? &amp;amp;nbsp;no responses about credit default swaps? &amp;amp;nbsp;obama&amp;#039;s tax plan for the middle class? &amp;amp;nbsp;thought so.&amp;amp;nbsp;  omg a chain e-mail, those are real reliable. &amp;amp;nbsp;yeah, that was an interview on the howard stern show. &amp;amp;nbsp;so what? &amp;amp;nbsp;you&amp;#039;re trying to say obaam supporters are dumb? &amp;amp;nbsp;look at you, you can&amp;#039;t even respond to anything i posted without changing the topic.  i guess you didn&amp;#039;t read the link i sent you about credit default swaps. &amp;amp;nbsp;the crisis had to do with traders betting back and forth on the viability of people&amp;#039;s mortgages, not becuase the mortgages went unpaid. &amp;amp;nbsp;look at AIG, the insurance company that stayed afloat after the nation&amp;#039;s biggest natural disaster, yet you think some people defaulting on $100,000 put them under? &amp;amp;nbsp;come on, wake up.  on one hand you have a couple of people with mortgages on $300,000 homes. &amp;amp;nbsp;on the other hand you have 5,000 traders betting back and forth on whether or not they&amp;#039;ll default. &amp;amp;nbsp;tell me, which one do you think has more repercussions for the economy?  i&amp;#039;m sorry, an extra $12 a year is out the wazoo? &amp;amp;nbsp;if you make $600,000 a year and $12 is going to make a big difference, you really need to evaluate your spending habits and lifestyle.  guess what? obama is pro-gun rights. &amp;amp;nbsp;wrong again. &amp;amp;nbsp;hmm, info from a questionnaire filed under his name in 1996? &amp;amp;nbsp;a little outdated and shady, no?  sorry you&amp;#039;re scared by people with middle eastern sounding names, but i hate to break it to you - that&amp;#039;s prejudice. timothy mcveigh perpetrated the oklahoma city bombing, mccain&amp;#039;s last name starts with mc- too, OMG I&amp;#039;M SCARED! get over it.&amp;amp;nbsp;  look, copy and paste stuff all you want, but you don&amp;#039;t understand this stuff, and that&amp;#039;s fine but you should just admit it and say that you were unaware of what his tax plan was and you&amp;#039;ll look into it.&amp;amp;nbsp;
