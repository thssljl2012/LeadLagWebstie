  Hi       Nope - I didn&amp;#039;t have an HSBC account at all (we were Barclays for 20 years)when I applied for the UK one - at the same time as opening that she initiated the Canada one.      So best advice I can give is if you call HSBC and say that you wish to open a bank account uk - they will then take you through most of it and then say you have to go into your local branch and then provide ID.      At this point - ask the person you set up the UK account with at the branch - to set you up with the International Banking people - they will do so because they earn commission off of all accounts they create etc.      I promise I didn&amp;#039;t have my account for even 1 week let alone 12 months.      I did have to pay 100 to open the International account  when they opened it - they just took funds out of the new UK account - but to me it was worth it - as I have all my banking material here.      I can always swap over to non-global bank when I have had time to check them out locally.      It also helped with Moneycorp because they bank with HSBC as well so the transfers to and from were immediate.      Nats
