I think it&amp;#039;s possible.  Under bankruptcy most executory contracts (any contract with a promise to perform in the future) can be wiped out.  Caveat: I am not an expert in this area and collective bargaining agreements might get special treatment under BK law.       The trouble with bankruptcy is that your suppliers want you to pay COD, your warantees are shaky, etc., so you take a big hit with customers and with suppliers.  Plus, if you move the BK court to cancel the CBA, then the union probably strikes.  Despite all this, I still think they should be threatening Ch. 11 despite these problems because the unions know they are not going to win in the end.  oo much public opinion against them, and without federal intervention, then BK will happen.  I think that eventually they will have to try for an employee owned stock company or something similar so the unions give concessions, and in return they have an equity stake, seats on the board, etc.       There are plenty of tools available like CH. 11 that can be used to work our way thorugh this crisis without printing money and robbing the taxpayer.       The single most expensive item that goes into the big three cars is not steel, it is the cost of health care.  To buy some time the UAW should accept a 15% co-pay on insurance and suspend some of the work rules.  Just make sure all the executives pay at least that.
