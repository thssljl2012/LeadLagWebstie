 THe best way forward is to be honest.  Put down all your accounts as the OR can find them anyway and you don&amp;#039;t want to be seen to be keeping things from the OR or he may decide to go through your case with a fine tooth comb.  Everything can be cross referenced and the OR has ways of finding bank accounts.  You can either open a Barclays Basic account or a Coop Cashminder account.  I prefer the Coop one because it has a debit card whereas barclays just comes with an ATM card.     Best to empty your bank account before BR too.
