          Last year I took out home insurance with Barclays through Confused. The price was 8, or 58 with a 50 cash back, if I remember correctly this deal was available only through &amp;#039;confused&amp;#039;.  I have never received anything about the cash back. As its soon time to renew again, I called Barclays to enquire when I would get the cash.  First I was told it was price matched and I never sent them details of my previous cover and when I said, that I had not seen anything to show that this was case or been sent anything , she went for help. After a couple of mins she said it was only for contents and would only be half the amount anyway and I had not answered any of their correspondence. I have kept the single letter I received from them, nothing in it regarding previous insurance or indeed cash back.  I do not remember anything like this at all! I have received nothing about it either! I did keep of couple of web pages from &amp;#039;confused&amp;#039; both saying the quote was 8, but little more other than the day I got the quote and date it would be starting. It states its for &amp;#039;contents&amp;#039;.  I shall be phoning back but is this mis-leading advertising or what? What angle would it be better in order to get the dosh I was led to believe would be mine. Confused, of course say its between me and the insurer (give me Quidco any day!!)   Golfkilo suggests I dont waste my time over it ......  But for me its the principle but I dont think I can prove anything, the pages I kept, though show that 8 was the cheapest it does not actually say its with Barclays!
