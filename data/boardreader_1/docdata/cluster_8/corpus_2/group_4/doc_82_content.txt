 bump.    My husband has 10 years of contributions to the NHS pension scheme. I know nothing about this scheme nor how it works, except that I think it could be a final salary scheme. He became a deferred member 10 years ago. He also made avc&amp;#039;s through Barclays during that time.I&amp;#039;m not sure why . Perhaps this should be transferred to the deferred NHS schemem if that is allowed.    I am trying to understand whether or not he is better leaving this in the UK, as perhaps these final salary schemes have good benefits,  or transferring it out to where we currently reside.    Very confused.      He will be 50 next year.
