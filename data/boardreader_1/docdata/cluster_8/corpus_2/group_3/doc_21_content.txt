He said, &amp;amp;quot;it was not the insurance side of AIG that had the issues.&amp;amp;quot; Anyone on the dis had problems with AIG Insurance? I know they carry a lot of Property Insurance.   I except a personal check for rentals. My rentals are far enough in advance that there is plenty of time for the check to clear. I have used Paypal, but I prefer not to. I have never had a check returned. If I did, I would have pleanty of time to receive a cashiers check or cancel the reservation. I don&amp;#039;t use points that are about to expire.       I have never had a renter send me a check before I would make the reservation. I make the reservation, send the contract for them to sign with a check back to me. Why make something harder than it has to be? I have had wonderful families. Never a problem. I don&amp;#039;t rent close to a vacation date. Pleanty of time for all to transpire.
