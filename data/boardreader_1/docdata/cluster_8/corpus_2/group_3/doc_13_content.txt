   quote   Mycon     I know the reason why Chelsea are suing all these people, it&amp;#039;s because Abrahmovic&amp;#039;s wealth has plummeted apparently because of the credit crisis.   It&amp;#039;s worrying that Roman could proabably lose about 5bil and still be easily in the black! Also, his money is in oil, which is on the up, so he&amp;#039;s probably making more.    (And yes, I understand it&amp;#039;s tongue in cheek)
