Anyone got any others?    Compensation schemes aside, it could be argued that simply choosing the right offshore bank will make more difference to your deposit&amp;#039;s safety - e.g. I think it&amp;#039;s arguable that HSBC Offshore is pretty safe because HSBC is considered pretty safe at the moment (though their interest rates aren&amp;#039;t good).                        A&amp;amp;amp;L and B&amp;amp;amp;B international still have good rates relative to Abbey. Might want to get in before they synchronize with abbey.    geurnesy offers no protection whatsoever, which is a bit off putting.
