         FIRSTLY CAN I SAY THANK YOU FOR THE HELP THAT CAME FROM MY LAST QUESTION RE MY MOTHER IN LAW, and her savings. I have yet another blonde dilemma........ I have been left what reads as 400.000 shares (group 1) in legal &amp;amp;amp; general. The account product is &amp;amp;quot; L&amp;amp;amp;G (barclays)MM UK core fund (A)&amp;amp;quot; i have less than the faintest idea of what this means or value..... can anyone help. I have tried to educate myself via google but i have managed to confuse myself even more. From what i can gather these shares right now are worth -12 if that helps but if anyone could possibly tell me in non technical terms how to read this and advise what i should do i would really appreciate it..... although, iv always wanted to get on the phone and shout SELL... SELL... SELL but i will try to stop myself  Regards  xxxxxx
