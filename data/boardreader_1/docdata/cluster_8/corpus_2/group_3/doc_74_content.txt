For any of my fellow racers who I met at Oxford this yeartake a good look at your insurance policy. I kept my full coverage goimg on my stang even after I paid it off last April. I was just getting to change so I could have more cah in my checking account. I figured full coverage , well full coverage I&amp;#039;m covered right? Not!! Acording to AIG who I was covered by said that all my so called After Market parts that I installed were not covered. I needed to have a special full coverage policy that covers anything that was not stock from Ford. F--- me! I know 6K ain&amp;#039;t alot to most of you seasond guys but ya know 6k could have been the supercharger kit that I wanted. Wow live and learn huh? Get this my stang was in excelent condition with 84K on the odomometer and all sites that I looked at came just under 10K, freaking AIG and most insurance companies use this company called CCC Market Evaulation because of the way they appraise vehicles. They actually use the condition of what other vehicles of the same type in the area. That caught my eye, well needless to say there is a pretty big leagle thing going on cause it aint right. It&amp;#039;s only right for the insurance companies and us the consumers are getting screwed. AIG is only gonna give 7400.00 for my stang and 1000.00 for all my parts. 8400.00 bucks for all the work I did to keep my baby that way. I have never been so insulted, and depressed. I WAS gonna try and buy a Dodge Challenger R/T, test drove one last Tuesday, freaking hot man, freaking hot. 30,330 was the best I could get but my wife was doing the talking and she was saying no freaking way. I want it, I want it bad. I think I need to see a shrink, this can&amp;#039;t be normal how I feel about owning a muscle car right?
