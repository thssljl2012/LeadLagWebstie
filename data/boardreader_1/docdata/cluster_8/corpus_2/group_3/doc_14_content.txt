 You guys need to start reading the details and not the gloom and doom headlines.      The government does not own 80% of AIG.  Some of you clearly do not understand the details of the original $85 billion cash credit line loan plan, which AIG has not even fully taken out.      Also, this $35 billion line of credit is not tied to the $85 billion line, so it has different stipulations.  As a matter of fact, if AIG wants to, they can use this $35 billion and replay easily what was borrowed from the government in the original deal and be sitting in the prime spot to buy up falling companies for pennies on the dollar.        Oh, and only 10 AIG employees in Cali for the &amp;amp;quot;retreat&amp;amp;quot; and none of them were AIG execs.  Another one in a few weeks in Cali with about 50 AIG employees.  Sorry, but this is SOP in the insurance industry to wine and dine power brokers.  Have to spend money to make money....       Some of you clearly need to learn how to read details and what to look and the catchy gloom and doom headlines.      Besides, I got in at $2.27 and I am still up over 40% even with this &amp;amp;quot;down&amp;amp;quot; moment.  There is still time to get in before the Bull run as this stock is cheap....
