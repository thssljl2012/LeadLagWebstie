         Hello Tournesolf , I think everybody has their hands full at the moment.....Its very quiet on here, deathly quiet. I was thinking of buying in yesterday afternoon but couldnt even get logged on to Barclays, in hindsight it probably saved me from myself. I am now resigning myself that the markets are so messed up that anything is possible and I dont mind admitting I dont know what the hell is going to happen to get this mess sorted, mind you Anthony Bolton sais he was buying last Friday ( bet he wished he had waited until yesterday ... or later) I think that we may see oil shares drop a fair bit more yet, regardless of some seemingly absurd valuations .... I think if you price oil shares at between $50 to $60 per barrel , you just might not be so dissapointed .I wish I had sold in May and gone away like I did last year.  Its all deja vu reminiscant of the tech stock crash. and worse
