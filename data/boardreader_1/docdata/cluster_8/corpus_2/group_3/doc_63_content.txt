Could this be as simple as the pin being locked for security purposes?                      Barclays  Co-Op  Halifax/Bank of Scotland  Alliance and Leicester    Why, that&amp;#039;s hardly anyone!    And yes, merchants can see what kind of card the customer should have, depending on the PoS technology they have. It&amp;#039;s actually a nice little fraud check for cloned cards: does the card design match what the card details say the card is?
