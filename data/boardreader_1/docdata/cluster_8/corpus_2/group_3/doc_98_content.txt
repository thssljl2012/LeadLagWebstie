 Amidst the current economic climate I decided to look properly at our finances and hopefully work out a strategy that 1. would cover our income in case of even more bank problems and 2. bring us the maximum interest. After reading some of Martin&amp;#039;s articles (regular saver, direct saving, best bank accounts) I wanted to try the following:    Open either B&amp;amp;amp;B or B&amp;#039;ham Midshire saving accounts (6.52&amp;amp;#37; - one for me and one for my significant other) and get our salaries paid to it. Then set up direct debits of 1000 each to go to ...    Two Abbey In-credit Accounts (8% during 1st year) that have close to the upper limit already in them (2500). These accounts have direct debit set up for 500 back to the above saving accounts and another of 500 to ...    Two A&amp;amp;amp;L Premier Direct (8.5% 1st year) also with close to the upper limit amount in each (2500). These accounts have direct debits back to orignal saving account.    The 1000 and 500 are minimum deposits to be put each month. The &amp;#039;close to upper limit of 2500&amp;#039; is to make sure the interest don&amp;#039;t take the account over the limit for lesser interest rates - need to check if interest are paid monthly.    I also thought of carrying on the &amp;#039;strategy&amp;#039; with a Barclays regular monthly saver and putting 250 in it each month instead of going back to the original saving account.     As all of these have 1 year limits on them I could re-organise the strategy next year.     Am I making sense? Is this kind of &amp;#039;strategy&amp;#039; something common amongst you money savvy peeps or am I just talking rubbish and being stupid? Any comments appreciated.
