 Thanks for all the good wishes.   Went into Barclays branch and after 1 hr+ they tracked the money to this L Stevens account.They have to contact said person and sort it out just waiting to hear today. I could hear the manager shouting at the cashier (I actually felt sorry for him)      Still can&amp;#039;t get to the bottom of though - they he had transposed 2 numbers of the sort code so instead of 205914 he had entered 205419 but this must mean Barclays customers have the same account no just different sort codes . To me this sounds like a fob off just doesn&amp;#039;t sit right if you know what I mean.   Any way hopefully all sorted today
