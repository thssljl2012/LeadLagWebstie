 VLO Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Interesting....            Lazy start to the day and I opened my email to find three (3) soothing emails from my London banker.

I&amp;#039;m pleased to report that the bottoms of all my pots and pans have been restored to their pristine state.      (Some folks bake, I clean....)
