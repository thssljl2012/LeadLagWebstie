         Rumours of a HSBC buyout, no mention of price but I would assume a gift to them at 2 a share, no way they could do that deal at any other point in history. Probably no cash inolved i would guess. Worlds gone mad.  I also read soemthing like RBS has 12b debt to pay by march as does hsbc but barclays has seomthing like 16b by then ... surely giving it real issues if things dont get liquid or they will have to take HMG deals.  Fear has been a terrible thing, amplified by the instant media world we now live in.
