         Simon  Admittedly you&amp;#039;ve got my attention with this angle. However, I am very aware of the saying &amp;amp;quot;If it seems too good to be true&amp;amp;quot;.  I am generally a person of good faith and will therefore give you the benefit of the doubt. I feel i should point out that my loan is with Barclays and I am almost certain that their legal department is one of the best for many reasons.  How exactly would you suggest to proceed with this ? I would gladly copy the wording from my agreement into a post here if that would help - mainly because this is a group help site and others may benefit from any outcome good or bad. OR  is there any wording in particular which I should look for in the agreement&amp;#039;s T&amp;amp;amp;C&amp;#039;s.  Kind regard and I look forward to your reply.  Cazza99
