  Thanks Barclays manager.  Your bonuses have not been in vain.        To be honest, I have never had a problem with Barclays ever and I have banked with them since old enough to hold a current account.  But then this 22 a week thing came into play.     Now that I know I can cancel this, I again think this seems ok, and that so far it prooves Barclays are the up there as a fairer one amongst the others, and thankyou for the advice.     I guess my only quarm would be, why they changed me onto this service, without asking me first?     Rottie,     I feel for you, a similar thing happened to me, I was luckier than you in I managed to cap it before it got too bad.  But not until being 200 out of pocket.  They are unreasonable, and unfair, and like you say would not even wait until you got paid.  From what i have experienced and read, I would not advise anybody to bank with them.  I wont be doing so soon.
