    Cis:      Social Orphan&amp;#039;s babe:       servo invicem:  Doesnt matter when mccain owned(owns?) fannie mae stock.     but does it matter to you that McCain&amp;#039;s top advisers who are lobbyists will write the tax laws for themselves?  Here&amp;#039;s an excerpt from my source... Read:   Of those 177 lobbyists, according to a Mother Jones review of Senate and House records, at least 83 have in recent years lobbied for the financial industry McCain now attacks. These are high-paid influence-peddlers who have been working the corridors of the nation&amp;#039;s capital to win favors and special treatment for investment banks, securities firms, hedge funds, accounting outfits, and insurance companies. Their clients have included AIG, the newest symbol of corporate excess; Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy on Monday sending the stock market into a tailspin; Merrill Lynch, which was bought out by Bank of America this week; and Washington Mutual, the banking giant that could be the next to fall. Among these 83 lobbyists are McCain&amp;#039;s chief political adviser, Charlie Black (JP Morgan, Washington Mutual Bank, Freddie Mac, Mortgage Bankers Association of America); McCain&amp;#039;s national finance co-chairman, Wayne Berman (AIG, Blackstone, Credit Suisse, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac); the campaign&amp;#039;s congressional liaison, John Green (Carlyle Group, Citigroup, Icahn Associates, Fannie Mae); McCain&amp;#039;s veep vetter, Arthur Culvahouse (Fannie Mae); and McCain&amp;#039;s transition planning chief, William Timmons Sr. (Citigroup, Freddie Mac, Vanguard Group).  When cable news shows air footage of McCain railing against greedy execs and the lobbyists who rig the rules for the benefit of Wall Street dealmakers, there ought to be a crawl beneath him listing these lobbyists. (Talk about a fair and balanced presentation.) Short of that, here&amp;#039;s the list of the McCain aides and bundlers who have worked for the high-finance greed-mongers McCain has pledged to take on. So far, it seems, none of them have been cast out of the campaign. If McCain were serious about his outrage, he might throw these money-changers out of his own temple.  the full story here:  http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/09/9753_mccain  _campaign_lobbyists_wall_street_aig.html      As much as I agree, that story is written bias, thus it is unfair.    how could a list of McCain&amp;#039;s lobbyists and who they write tax code / make money from be biased? it&amp;#039;s the truth. The list of federal lobbyists and who they wrangle money for is pubic record.
