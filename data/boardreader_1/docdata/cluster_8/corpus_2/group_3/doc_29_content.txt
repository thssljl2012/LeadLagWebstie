 I&amp;#039;ve just watched the BarclayCard Contactless TV advert. Aside from the fact that its actually quite an entertaining ad, its interesting in that it is the first mass marketing campaign for this technology AFAIK.     I thought it would be interesting to start a thread to see what people think of the ad and how the view the technology.      I must confess to having a professional/technical interest in this. However, I have no commercial connection with Barclays and this isn&amp;#039;t an attempt to spam the board. If anyone knows of another issuer who is actively promoting this technology then please post details.
