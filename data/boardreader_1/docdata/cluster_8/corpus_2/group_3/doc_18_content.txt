We are, as it goes, relatively strict with our lending and access to any sort of credit features. As minor as it may sound, a Visa Debit features a floor limit, which we must guarantee. This could easily result in a 250 loss, which adds up over a few million customers.    I would say we&amp;#039;re 50/50 when it comes to an &amp;amp;quot;internal&amp;amp;quot; score and an external score. If we relied too much on account performance, we could effectively be deceived into trusting someone while every other bank on the high street is chasing them for money.
