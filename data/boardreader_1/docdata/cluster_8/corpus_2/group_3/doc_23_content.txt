It seems deposits in banks in Malaysia are guaranteed up to RM60K per account.                                              yeap... before PIDM, all our savings are guaranteed directly by BNM but I am not sure whether it is 100%.      so like other insurance firm eg. AIG, PIDM can also go bankrupt...
