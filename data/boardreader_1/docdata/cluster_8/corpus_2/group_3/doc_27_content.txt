Hi all, Could do with some solid advise. I will give an outline of my partners position but can go more in depth if need be. Basically when my partner was married she owned a shop which she and her husband co-signed on the lease. Now the shop was put into liquidation 18 months ago but the lease has still not been re-assigned. Now the landlord is after my partner for 30k and has applied to make her bankrupt. Also there is a 25k barclays loan that my partner is the sole signatury on. They are also hounding and they have threatened to put a charge on the house. Now my partner rang bankruptcyadvisoryservice.co.uk who told her after relieving her of 600 that you will need to pay them off or the judge will order that you sell your house or you will be made bankrupt and the house will be taken because there is about 90k equity in the house. Also neither the lease nor the barclays overdraft was secured on this property that she owns now. We are in a jam as she has 2 small kiddies living with her and would appreiciate some advise.  cheers                                  jim
