 Do you think any member of congress will vote for a bailout of Wall St when they are up for re election in November and their opponent will use their vote against them??? Or more simply do you honestly think that Dems like Pelosi, Reid, Rangel, Hoyer, Frank, and etc care about small busineess owners or Main St when these twogroupsdo not have deep pockets lobbyistslike Goldman Sachs,Citigroup, Freddie, Morgan Stanley, AIG, Fannie, Wachovia, National City, Barclays,andetc.or make megabucks contributions to their campaigns??
