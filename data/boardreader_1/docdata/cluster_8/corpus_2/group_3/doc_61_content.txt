  I am in a simular position but wanted to make sure this was the case.     I have a offset account with Barclays that I would say im offsetting around 60-70% of my mortgage.      So what your saying is that if they went under (which I can&amp;#039;t see), my money i would just turn a debt of 30-40% of the mortgage. Which I could in theory get another mortgage and take my savings back?
