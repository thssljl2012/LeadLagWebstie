  Hi there     I took out a maxi ISA approximately 9-10 years ago with the Woolwich.  Since the Woolwich was taken over by Barclays, this was transferred to the Barclays Alpha Maxi ISA which is invested in the UK.  I originally invested 5,000 and this figure has gone down but never really improved significantly on the original investment.  I am now thinking of cashing this in but I have no idea what to do or how they work out how much money I will get back.  I am not even sure if it is a wise thing to do or not in the current climate.  I fully admit to not really knowing what I was getting myself into at the time, hence the ignorance now.  Any help would be very gratefully received.     Thanks
