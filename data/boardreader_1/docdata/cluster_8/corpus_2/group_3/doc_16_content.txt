  Progressive sucks , I had progressive for years until after my accident where some one hit me from behind. I went from both vehicles (06 F150, 05 Dodge Ram) , full coverage of $150 month to $336 month.       I dropped them and got Personal / Business Full coverage on both vehicles for $2200 a year with 1st Commercial. Now I can use either vehicles for work or play and not worry about any red tape.
