September 30, 2008  USDC Order Obstructing Bailout Lawsuits Appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals  An emergency appeal challenging a ruling by the U.S. District Court in Albany denying two requests for emergency injunctions to halt the Wall Street bailouts was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan. As the bailout crisis evolved rapidly over the last ten days, We The People Foundation Chairman Bob Schulz filed two lawsuits seeking to block the bailouts by challenging the underlying authority of the Government.   The appeal seeks to overturn a ruling late last week by the District Court gutting requests for an emergency hearing at which representatives of the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve and U.S. Congress would have been forced to publicly produce evidence establishing the Constitutional and/or statutory authority permitting the AIG and $700 billion bailout packages.  Without addressing the underlying issues, the District Court (erroneously) ruled that the lawsuits failed to properly assert the federal jurisdiction needed to issue a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO).  Key to both lawsuits is WTP&amp;#039;s assertion that Congress lacks any Constitutional authority to delegate any power to Treasury to utilize public taxpayer funds for fundamentally private purposes. In the first lawsuit filed September 18th, WTP sought to enjoin the $85 billion bailout of privately owned insurer American Insurance Group (AIG), which was initiated without any Congressional authorization whatsoever.
