The biggest problem caused by AIG locally was the purchase of 21st Century Insurance. To old saying, &amp;amp;quot; if it&amp;#039;s not broken don&amp;#039;t fix it&amp;amp;quot; just doesn&amp;#039;t apply to AIG. 21st Century was a company that everyone trusted and a company that supported the local economy. AIG takes them over and changes everything with the company operation. AIG also supports the business method of motivating with fear.  Spend $3.00 of the $100,000,000,000 and taken Warren Buffet for coffee, he&amp;#039;ll show you how to buy, run and motivate a company and it&amp;#039;s employees. It&amp;#039;s time the executives stop the vacations, junkets, and massive compensations and share with the little people so they can keep their jobs.
