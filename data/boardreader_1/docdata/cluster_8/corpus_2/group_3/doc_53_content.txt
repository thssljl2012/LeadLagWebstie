People look at AIG and go &amp;amp;quot;well how the fuck is an insurer falling into this shitstorm??&amp;amp;quot;      What people don&amp;#039;t realize is that there are more then just auto insurance, health insurance and life insurance. There is another sub-category of insurance companies that deal in financial insurance. These financial insurers, which make up the majority of AIG&amp;#039;s portfolio, are the companies that underwrite these unregulated exotic financial derivative packages that you were explaining. It&amp;#039;s a vicious trickle down process. Actually more like a &amp;amp;quot;trickle up&amp;amp;quot; in the case of the current crisis. It goes something like this      Housing bubble bursts (the middle class is fucked)   which leads to:   Foreclosures come rolling in (The banks are fucked)   which leads to:   Exotic Derivatives deteriorate exponentially (Investment Banks/Hedge Funds = fucked)   which leads to:   Financial Insurers take INCREDIBLE and unsustainable hits resulting in massive losses (huge financial corporations, ala AIG.......yep you guessed it......FUCKED)                      which leads to a melt-down on a global scale. 1200 trillion dollar Derivative market and a 600 trillion dollar global economy - 1 doesn&amp;#039;t fit into the other
