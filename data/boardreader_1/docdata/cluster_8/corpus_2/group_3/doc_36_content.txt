 Gaia Online                                                            &amp;amp;quot;The Curse&amp;amp;quot;    &amp;amp;quot;Horace Burtons Ghost&amp;amp;quot;  The Reserve Bank of Australia has just stated the economic collapse is not catastrophic..and we may just be in a recession, though Benanke won&amp;#039;tsay the word.   So I suppose it was only the less wealthy that got the pooey end of the stick...        If you watched insight (is that the right name?) tonight on SBS the minister said &amp;amp;quot;Our economy was originally predicted to be in the growth rate of 2 - 3 percent.  It&amp;#039;s now a bit lower than that, but still in the positive&amp;amp;quot;.    So good news for our camp.    However, our dollar went from 95 US cents to 68 in a matter of a couple of months.    And doesnt that suck....just when i thought i would be paying a decent price for a litre of pertrol rather than the kings ransom I am paying now lol.  I suppose I was just pointing out, that the media coverage may not be as long winded as the oe on the most recent war.....oh well, sure they can&amp;#039;t make the bubble burst for just a little longer.....                 &amp;amp;nbsp;          &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;
