  Hi all in the same boat.     Have tried to jump ship i.e. remortgage or sell up and move on, but not much luck in this so far. Will have to put on life jacket and ride the storm, but hope to be rescued before the boat sinks.     Barclays only take your money for Capstone, but if they stop taking it we could loss our homes, so perhaps our government will buy this  toxic waste  and save us all before giving our hard earned taxes to the RICH B--ANKERS that have ruined our economy (PRUDENT INVESTMENT)..!!
