          I wish people would stop looking at the mortgages and start looking at Wall Street. Paulson, it seems to me, has his fingers in alot of pies.   Hi Jean,  I thought this article did look at Wall Street, particularly AIG&amp;#039;s role in this. After reading the NY Times link you posted, it sounds as though Fannie and Freddie were pressured into taking more risks by both Wall St and Congress. At the same time, these loans were placed into securities (Credit Default Swaps) and sold around the world. AIG steps in with &amp;amp;quot;insurance&amp;amp;quot; for the CDS&amp;#039;s, which allow the banks to get around the Basel II regulations allowing them to keep less capital on hand than they should have been carrying. Now the house of cards collapse when AIG goes under. Several institutions, no longer having the CDS insurance, also go belly up due under capitalization when their CDS&amp;#039;s started having huge losses. The whole thing was smoke and mirrors.   Does this sound about right? I&amp;#039;m still trying to wrap my head around it. Being an IT guy doesn&amp;#039;t really give me a foundation for finance.   Grape
