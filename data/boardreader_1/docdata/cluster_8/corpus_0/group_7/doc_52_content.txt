My mom called me yesterday night asking me if I had enough money to use till the end of this month. I said &#8220;yes&#8221; but in fact the right answer was &#8220;no.&#8221; I am just a stubborn kid who is reluctant to take money from the parents. I will be doomed if paychecks are not released by next Monday. How pathetic!  I have been having bread, biscuit, and cup noodles for breakfast and lunch for many days due to financial constraint. That&#8217;s the life of a poor man is like. You can picture it - nothing fancy nothing good. I have pledged to eat as much as I could when I am in Malaysia on behalf of not only myself but a lot of others, but I have failed to deliver this pledge so far. I will, I swear, eat as if I hadn&#8217;t eaten for years when I get my paycheck next week. (Then I will starve to death in the second half of the month @_@) I may describe my current situation in this way. I was like a country on the verge of bankruptcy. The little cash that I have in my wallet and the deposit in the local EON Bank were the government&#8217;s coffers. My deposit in US Bank in the U.S. was more like foreign exchange reserves held by me (the country) in US Dollar. My parents would play the role of International Monetary Fund (IMF), whom I might resort to in case of emergency. If I had no choice but to ask for loan from this IMF, some rules might be imposed on me, such as practice of frugality to avoid extravagant spending, implementation of a well-planned budget to bring prosperity back, and so on. Damn, I seriously need to come up with a financial stimulus package for myself&#8230; Posted in Economy, Life, Sadness, xD
