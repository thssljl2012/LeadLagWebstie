Cedar Posts wonders what President Obama is going to do with all those frequent flyer points?Chicago, Colorado, Canada, California and now Carolina.....Frankly speaking I know he likes Air Force One, and he's trying out his biggest toy but for crying out loud enough travel. It's like he shows up are the oval office and says how about I just take a short flight, you know around the block, over the White House, big turn over the Washington Monument and and just for laughs let's buzz the capitol.Ahhhh thats a negative ghost rider!Speaking of Obama, aren't you glad the Treasury has adopted a "stress test" for the big banks? Sure we have be on the stress test since last year good thing our health is better than Citibank, or Bank America.It's simple, allow banks to grow into unmanageable humongous monopolies, allow them to invest in tons of worthless securities, then baid them out with billons of taxpayer dollars.  After dumping billons into these banks, give up and let the bank crash, causing billon's of dollars in investment losses for joe average only to have the assests bought by another humongous bank.Nutz just Nutz!
