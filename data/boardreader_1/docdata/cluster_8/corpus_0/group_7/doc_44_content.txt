 Plus, Ed Morrissey's ever-wise reflections on thosewho live in glass houses.I agree that having the three CEOs of the American automakers fly to DC to plead poverty is laughably bad optics. If taxpayers bail out firms, in Detroit, Wall Street, or anywhere else, then that aid should come with some strings attached on how the money gets spent.
