My guess is they wont have to file for bankruptcy. Odds are much better theyll continue to receive gobs of dough from congress which in turn will be mandating what cars they build, where they build them, and who builds them (UAW, duh).This a democrat congress dream come true, they have the big three (at least Chrysler &amp; GM) by the balls and they will not squander the opportunity to get the cars built THEY know are best for us, and you can bet your ass theyll still be built by UAW workers, and they will NOT be making any concessions, as they wont need to, well be subsidizing their wages just a little more directly is all.What well end up with is a nationalized or subsidized auto company with subsidized well paid UAW members making little teeny Pelosimobiles. So if you want to buy what you actually like or need in the near future, youll need to look to Toyota, BMW, Hyundai, etc. for a good product. (kinda reminds me of the 70s)When you need a new car, youll get a goverment owned (and taxpayer subsidized) bank loan, on a government manufactured car, and odds are good youll insure it with a government owned insurance policy (AIG or similar). While youre there at the dealership, chances are the F&amp;I guy will be able to access your health records electronically as well.Its a damn shame, GM is finally building a real quality product, world class in fact, in my opinion, and the US Congress is gonna turn it back into turd motors. Swell.Now, thats not exactly change you can believe in, but it IS change you better get used to.
