Nationwide insurance is discriminatory aganist pit bulls as they do not give quotes or cover homeowners for homeowners insurance if you have a pit bull. I hate bad owners that make it so hard for good owners and good pit bulls, its absurd!!!! Are there other insurance agencies that do this wrongful act too??? I have to say, I support the insurance company on this one. They have to manage risk, and part of that risk the dogs people own. Unfortunately, there are quite a few really bad pit owners out there. Dont blame the insurance company, blame the irresponsible owners. Besides, to make a comparison- a regular docs malpractice insurance is about a fraction of what it is for a ob- have you ever wondered why there seem to be a larger number of docs getting OUT of the baby business? Used to, all gyns did OB, now, that number keeps dropping. Mostly because they cant afford to pay the insurance AND deliver babies. Are the insurance companies discrminiating against OBs.Similar posts:  company health insurance
