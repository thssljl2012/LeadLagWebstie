 As I spoke about last month, I have been working on a campaign for Nationwide Insurance.&amp;nbsp; This campaign purpose is a pure acquisition play.&amp;nbsp; The assignment was straightforward. Make the product a hero! Make those phones ring and create blazing click trail of online trial of quotes.&amp;nbsp;   We started with an insight that, in these trying economic times, people are switching insurance to save money on their car insurance. Then we combined it with our clients unique way of selling insurance which equates to a customized policy designed to meet your needs.&amp;nbsp;   In the end my team of N@TCH playas came together to launch a great DR (direct response) campaign!         Rock On Wunderman!&amp;nbsp; Check out the behind he scenes photos.
