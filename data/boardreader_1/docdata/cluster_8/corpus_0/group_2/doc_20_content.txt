Not so bleh today, I think it's because I had a good long sleep and burnt some candles last night (reverse the order) to relax...Woke up and phoned up Lloyds as asked to by email, the thing said not to prepare as it was only a short interview to make sure you fitted their requirements (bearing in mind I've done a mile long application already, complete with questionnaire).  Phoned them up and she was like "so what do you know about Lloyds?" ".....it's... a bank...?"  Okay I wasn't that bad but I might as well have been five years old.Que me embarking on one of the most cringeworthy phone interviews I've ever gone through...  So she puts me on hold, and I'm sat there thinking "okay, just say I'm crap and I can get on with my life".  She asks me to the selection day!  I was like.... WHUT?  But yeah, I am pleased.  It's not a great deal of money but it's a damn sight more than minimum minimum bloody wage.  I mean what's so magical about being 22 that means I can earn an extra quid?  I really don't understand that one.Finished Anansi Boys, which was alright.  Not brilliant but alright.  Moved onto Coraline and then finished that but Zach sent me the graphic novel a bit back so I already knew the jist of the story.  So now it's back onto ones that I might give away to the charity shop but also might keep... usually it's the former.Off to Nottingham tomorrow for a couple of days O_O  ^_^
