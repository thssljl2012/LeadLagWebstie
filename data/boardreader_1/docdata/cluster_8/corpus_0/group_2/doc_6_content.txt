This is a question that has been milling about in my head for a while and I feel like I need to get it out just so I can clear it out and move onto other things.  The basic form is questioning whether or not the United States Post Office can be held accountable for a person's financial situation should they fail to do their ascribed duty.  This is entirely hypothetical and not based on any real account that I am aware of, but say that one had a credit card with one bank and kept all their other banking issues (savings, checking) with another bank and that they were to mail a payment in the form of a check to the former bank.Should the former bank fail to receive payment on time it is likely that they will bill the person in question for late fees, and depending on the person's particular situation conceivably even overcharge fees that would not have resulted otherwise.  For a moment let's stack the deck against the post office; suppose that the person in question mailed said payment the day after they got notice which would typically give them a month for payment to be received and considered on time.  This has, at the very least, been my experience with Bank of America.  And also assume that everything was written completely legibly so that in no way, shape, or form could anything they had written be misconstrued so that the payment is sent to, say, the wrong State.  If there are any other variables I am not considering, which could very well be the case, just leave them out of your mind and assume that they are accounted for so as to make the vast majority, as close to 100% as possible, of the blame is to lie with the actions of the post office.Now, the aforementioned additional charges are not likely to be the only financial ramification resultant of the post offices failure to deliver the mail in a timely as it is also likely that the person in question's credit score will also suffer as well which could, conceivably, prevent them from attaining a loan.The question, with all of these things in mind, is this: Can the post office be held monetarily accountable for this?  Is there any issue to which the post office can be monetarily accountable should a suit be brought against them, or could a suit be brought against them in the first place?
