Now that Barclays is buying Lehman Brothers' broker-dealer business, the British firm is also getting Lehman's Seventh Avenue headquarters. The NY Times has a great story following the building's history: It was originally built for Morgan Stanley, but MS decided back out before it was finished and Lehman bought the building four weeks after the 9/11 attacks.  The Partnership for NYC's Kathryn Wilde said, Barclays has had a rather modest presence here, so this is a big new commitment to New York. Given the role that many of our New York-based firms have played in building Londons presence in the worlds financial markets, it seems like a good quid pro quo. Barclays will also have another marquee NYC address for its name: The Barclays Center where the Nets will play at the Atlantic Yards.
