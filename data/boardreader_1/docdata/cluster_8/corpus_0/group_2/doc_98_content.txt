Today on Ankarlo Mornings: Ankarlo reacts to the Charles Gibson interview of Gov. Sarah Palin. Gibson was a jerk at times, though Ankarlo says tough questions should be asked of Palin. Also, the economy is taking some hits today. Lehman Brothers declared bankrupcy, Merrill Lynch is going to be bought by Bank of America, AIG is in trouble and the Dow drops 500 points. Ankarlo talks to Ben Levinsohn from Business Week and later says it&amp;#8217;s time to end the welfare state. Diane and Ankarlo also talk about cankles, MILFS and FLERGs or FLIRGEs.
