To quote HorsesAss.org, a local political blog:BIGGEST. BANK FAILURE. EVER. (We're number one!)WAMU IS NO MORE. Craziness. Thanks Bush! You've completely f***ed us up financially WELL before you're out of office! GREAT!I'm so glad I didn't switch banks. I'm still with Bank of America, who's buying up bits and pieces of these failing companies. Not WaMu though. That's for the new #1 financial institution in the US: JP Morgan.Now they can't get their act together in Washington DC and bail some peoples out. They really REALLY should NOT bail out the companies. You know as well as I that for every dollar they give these companies, probably, optimistically, half will actually go to people who need it. They did restrict how much CEOs could get for leaving, but they'll take when they're allowed and run for international waters. The Goverment needs to get off it's ass and cut some checks for some desperate people who have been screwed by these companies.THANKFULLY, we did NOT buy this house through a bank, we're paying for it directly person to person. No banks involved. And all our finances are in BofA (except I have a whole $1 in TD Ameritrade). Yay!I'm such an economics nerd...Random note: Using a mouse with no right click sucks. Try it for 5 minutes and see how much you want to punch something. Luckily mine stopped working with time to spare to overnight a new trackball from Amazon. Why doesn't anyone else sell trackball mice...
