This business entity accepted tax dollars from the more than 27 million Americans who are uninsured because we cannot afford the high cost of health care insurance. Will AIG thank us with an offer of affordable health care insurance? Will they improve their service to those who are insured, supplying quick payments instead of delays or harassment in time of consumer need? Will AIG pass on the booming profits of the coming moments of success by reducing rates to the insured, rather than granting themselves bonuses or "Golden Parachutes"?  I dare say, I have as much interest in assisting this business entity as it has in helping me  an underpaid, unmarried, individual, uninsured taxpayer.
