I love reading the financial news commentaries and laughing at all the tongue-in-cheek and ultra sarcastic comments they make. From Reuters' article on Goldman and Morgan Stanley.."The results come a day after No. 4 investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy, swamped by mortgage losses. No. 3 broker Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc meanwhile rushed into the arms of Bank of America Corp to avoid a similar fate." Love that rushed into the arms bit. From an article (which I cannot remember the title of) in The Age (one of the newspapers circulated in Melbourne).."Is Lehman insured? Let's hope it's not AIG for starters." Hahaha! Ouch!!!The Age's Business section on their website even has this segment called Nightmare on Wall Street and they did up this title bar for that segment, which I found hilarious.The global credit crisis is no laughing matter, but I cannot help but be amused by all these sarcastic and witty jibes.
