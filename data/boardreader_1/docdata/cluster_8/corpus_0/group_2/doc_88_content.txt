But Washington Mutual is now gone. That's the first of these banks that's, I don't know, a totally normal bank, right? I know it's enormous and probably has investments and lines of credit and credit cards and such wierd stuff that I'm not involved with but doesn't it also have checking and savings accounts?Why should I believe that KeyBank or TCF or NationalCity or Chase won't go under? Well, probably Chase won't, or Bank of America, they both seem to be absorbing everything.Should I just take all my money out of the bank and put it in the fish? I know everything is insured the the FDIC so I don't actually have to worry about that anymore. If KeyBank goes under, I would get my money back. But I wonder if there would be a period of months where I don't have anything?Jeez. I'll be a librarian. Everything will be OK.
