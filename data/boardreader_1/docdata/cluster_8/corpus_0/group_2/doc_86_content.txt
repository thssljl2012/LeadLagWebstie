Recently, I saw this news story about someone whose bank changed his password. He was using the insulting password, "Lloyds is pants," and they changed it to "no its not."I've never before heard of insulting something by calling it pants, but for some reason it stuck in my head. If I were still 4 years old, right now I'd be going around calling everything pants. Fortunately I've developed enough self control not to do that now, but it doesn't mean I don't want to. A warning to people I see today: you may be more aware of pants tonight than you were this morning.
