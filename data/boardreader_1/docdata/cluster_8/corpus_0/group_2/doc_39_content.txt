When I first got back from Japan, many years ago, I wasn't sure what I was going to do next. I had felt called to be a missionary, and I loved my work. I really threw myself into teaching English and working at the small church where I served.But when I returned to the United States, I needed a job. I started working "temporary" at a small insurance office in my city. It was a very small branch of a large company; in fact, I believe there were just 5 of us in the office when I started.I worked as an assistant for a woman who was selling basically two kinds of insurance: Directors and Officers Insurance for large corporations, and Errors and Omissions Insurance for Professionals. I started as a clerk, and eventually became what is known as an "underwriting assistant." I started to handle more and more of the responsibilities until my boss left to take a position at a well-known brokerage. Then those in the regional office in Chicago discovered just how much I had been doing. I got a nice raise, and a promotion. I got training in the regional office in Chicago, and more training in their national headquarters in lower Manhattan. We went out for dinner, dancing and fun almost every night.The company also told me that they would like me to consider another promotion, which would take me to Chicago. This was just about the same time that I started to wrestle with the possibility that I might be called to ordained ministry. The move to Chicago sounded interesting, and of course it was flattering to be considered to be on the fast-track in a field that, to be honest with you, bored me to death. In the end, seminary won.Oh, and the name of the insurance company that I worked for many years ago?AIG.I'm very interested in what will happen in the next days....
