 WARNING: Lean Times Ahead Losses on stock markets have continued after the collapse of fourth largest US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, which has filed for bankruptcy protection. European markets opened sharply lower for a second day, with the UK&amp;#8217;s FTSE 100 and Germany&amp;#8217;s Dax both down 1.7%. Shares in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong fell more than 5%, having been shut on Monday for public holidays. Lehman, which may be about to sell its core assets to Barclays, is the latest victim of the global credit crunch.

Isn&amp;#8217;t it ironic? Don&amp;#8217;t you think? Where&amp;#8217;s Moses when you need him? Bad boy Brit artist Damien Hirst smashed his previous auction record with the $18.5 million sale of a gold tipped bull in formaldehyde on the first day of his major solo sale at Sotheby&amp;#8217;s in London Monday. Entitled The Golden Calf, the controversial artist&amp;#8217;s work exceeded the top end of its estimate by over $4 million, and toppled the previous record of $17.4 million paid for a Hirst work last summer, Bloomberg reports.
