Talking with grlnamedlucifer about the VP debate craziness reminded me I need to try to keep track of the many ways Senator McCain is proving my crackpot theory right.  So, here's my current list of ...John McCain's continuing efforts to throw the 2008 Presidential Race:- Asking Sarah Palin to be his Veep- Confusing the SEC and the FEC- Threatening to fire the Head of the SEC, when he can't do that- Annoying (and possibly infuriating) Spain- Claiming the economy is fundamentally sound in the middle of a huge economic meltdown- Admitting his running mate is unable to debate and arranging special rules for her- Phil Gramm- Claiming he's not for bank regulation, when he has been for forever- Claiming he does not want to privatize Social Security, when that has been his main goals for years- This: "Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation."- Confusing the National Guard with the Army- Forgetting how many houses he owns- Lying (so many times I can't list them all)- Running attack ads that were so vile even Karl Rove called him out on it- Publically trashing his major backers over the financial crisis- Claimed repeatedly last week he intends to reform the fed. Government by throwing out  well, himself.Am I missing anything?In other news, on Friday, one of my Republican co-workers insisted to me that a Judge who is refusing to set one of her motions for hearing must be doing it just to be mean and evil because "she is one of the newly elected Democrats."  I was like, "Bzuh? She's been on the bench for years!"  I was right.  The Evil, Mean Judge has been on the bench since 1989.  And is a Republican.  That's pretty much how things are politically at work. As you can imagine, I feel a little freaked out and frightened by my co-workers these days.  Mostly people don't talk about the upcoming election, but there are ugly little notes and newspapers articles left around and when they do talk about it ... oh, boy!Also, Ahahahahaha! Gotcha, Cheney!  He'll probably find some way to wiggle out of it, but it's still nice to see someone in our current government try to uphold the law.
