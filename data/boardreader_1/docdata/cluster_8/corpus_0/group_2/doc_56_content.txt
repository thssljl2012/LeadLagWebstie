This morning's New York Times featured a lengthy front-page article on the $700 billion Wall Street bailout the federal government's planning. I picked this one because it explains an extremely complicated financial issue in laymen's terms, and it quotes from some very powerful people (including our own Representative Barney Frank--three cheers for the MA 4th.)I&amp;nbsp;liked the superstructure of the article. It's laid out in a classic hard-news format, with a hard lead and facts going from general to specific as the article moves on. It quotes from the most powerful person first (the President), then works down to the Speaker of the House (Nancy Pelosi, D-CA 8th) the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee (Rep. Frank), and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who's involved in negotiations with Treasury. I was entertained by the fact that the people who's comments don't have very much weight, like House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH 8th), and the two presidential candidates (who have absolutely no say as to what will happen) were stuck towards the end of the article.I&amp;nbsp;also liked that this article just &amp;quot;covered the event&amp;quot;, so to speak, of the bailout proposal. There was no analysis from experts, because that was in an analysis article that was also featured on the front page. What I didn't like was the very end of the article, where the author included a short section about the fate of Lehman. To my mind, the partial Lehman sale to Barclays should have been a short (200-300 words)&amp;nbsp;article of its own, quoting from Lehman and Barclays officials and experts in the area. However, I&amp;nbsp;understand the space crunch the Times was probably feeling, between the special Sunday news-features that have probably been in since Thursday night (namely, the investigative story on disability payments), the financial crisis, Thabo Mbeki's resignation, and the terrorist attack in Islamabad.
