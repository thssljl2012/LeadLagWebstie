(2008-09-17) &amp;#8212; Just hours after lending $85 billion to insurance giant AIG to protect financial markets from a cataclysmic bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve announced early today it would also bail out Howard Jameson, 52, of Beech Creek, Pa., because the local man is &amp;ldquo;simply too big to fail.&amp;rdquo; Mr. Jameson, father of four, lost his job recently, sparking a liquidity crisis that could ripple through Beech Creek and beyond, hitting the bank in nearby Lock Haven that issued his mortgage, credit card giant HSBC and even a man down the road in Blanchard to whom Mr. Jameson still owes $200 for the used lawn tractor he bought in June.    &amp;#8220;In a town the size of Beech Creek (population 717), the loss of even one resident&amp;#8217;s income can have far-reaching effects,&amp;#8221; said an unnamed Fed spokesman. &amp;#8220;Of course the impact on his wife and children has been devastating already. We determined that Howard Jameson is just too big, too important, to fail.&amp;#8221;  The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, with the full backing of the U.S. Treasury, decided to step in, making a secured bridge loan, and taking an 80 percent stake in the Jameson family house and their 2003 Ford minivan as well as the remaining equity in the lawn tractor. The move effectively gives the U.S. government control over the Jameson family during the two-year term of the loan. Your Donation Fuels Family-Friendly Satire           ShareThis...
