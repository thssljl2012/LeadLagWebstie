Every day it's like watching the Titanic break off in pieces and the people on board trying to get on life boats and hope that they can keep afloat.I'm "officially" a employee of Barclays Capital now. Which apparently still means that I can get fired if they decide there's too many people in the group. I'm actually luckier than some of my co-workers who live and work outside of NYC. And I can't even verbalize how much it would suck if they were let go.As pissed as I am that taxpayers have to spend their money to keep the financial industry afloat, it's necessary at this point if we don't want to sink into a black hole. And that is really what is going to happen if we have another couple days like today. I am leaving for Florence Italy on Friday. I'm half thinking about making it a one-way trip.
