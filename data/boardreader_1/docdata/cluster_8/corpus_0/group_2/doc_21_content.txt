This morning Wall Street seemed to be primarily betting on the future of American International Group, Inc. (AIG), a giant insurance company. By lunch the numbers seem to indicate that the Street likes the odds that AIG will survive, at least the day. I suspect there are some parties with a vested interest who are helping to prop up the corpse.Meanwhile John McZombie is in Florida telling sickly gatherings of the living dead that he is sick of  Wall Street's financially unsound shenanigans. John McZombie is so surprised by the money men's greedy ponzi schemes. He's appalled. He's shocked, shocked to hear there's gambling going on here.Does anyone remember the late 80's? The Savings and Loan meltdown that cost the tax payers roughly $124.6 billion? (Money that would come in handy just now.) Remember Charles Keating? He was paying big benjis to his friends in the Senate to keep federal regulators away from his dubious books.After fraud and racketeering charges were brought against him by federal regulators Keating was asked whether his large contributions had bought him influence. Keating responded: I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.John McZombie was was reprimanded in the Senate Ethics Committee report on the matter for using "poor judgement".  It was probably hard to exercise good judgement when John McZombie  and his wife and kids were flying off in Keating's private jet to Keating's palatial vacation home in the Bahamas, often, very often. John loved that place; or when Cindy McZombie and her dear ole' Dad were in bed with Keating on some sweet investments. McZombie said of the incident: "I have done this kind of thing many, many times," and said the Lincoln case was like "helping the little lady who didn't get her Social Security." Indeed. John's always thinking about the little guy. Salt of the earth, that John.Maybe John will put Phil Gramm and Neil Bush in charge to fix this mess, that'd be great.
