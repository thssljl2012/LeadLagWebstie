Whoaaaaaa....Merrill Lynch was bought over by the Bank of America for USD50bil! And Investment bank Lehman declares bankruptcy. CNN had headlines that went something like 'Once in a century crisis hits US'. Is recession really gonna hit big time?Price of oil hit low at USD96/bbl. And Malaysia isn't doing very well herself. Our Law Minister has resigned and we were hoping that he could bring in some sort of hope to the judiciary. So what's gonna happen now?On a totally different note, there's really nothing much to do in Bintulu. Connection to the Shell VPN is so bad, I can't get any work done! =( Most of the time, I'm either curled up in bed, or eating. We had a major feast for dinner earlier - prawns, lobsters, Garoupa fish, PAKU PAKIS!, chicken, lamb, cheesecake, and more! Man we were all so stuffed! This is really overdoing it.Anyway, do pray for the nation and world. All of us need Jesus.
