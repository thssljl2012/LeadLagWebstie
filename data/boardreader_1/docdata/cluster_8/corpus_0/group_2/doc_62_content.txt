         Are Obama &amp; Biden Trying To Lose On PurposeI'm trying to explain their bizarre behaviors:Obama doubles down on his gaffe on Letterman"Keep in mind, technically, had I meant it this way, [Palin] would be the lipstick. The failed policies of John McCain would be the pig, just following the logic of this illogical situation," Obama said. And Slow Joe Biden (D - Bank of America) says what we've all been thinking:"Make no mistake about this," Biden responded. "Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be vice president of the United States of America. Lets get that straight. Shes a truly close personal friend, she is qualified to be president of the United States of America, shes easily qualified to be vice president of the United States of America, and quite frankly, it might have been a better pick than me. Are these guys trying to lose? Also a reminder of what I asked on September 2nd, when will Biden drop out?Labels: 2008, Biden, obama
