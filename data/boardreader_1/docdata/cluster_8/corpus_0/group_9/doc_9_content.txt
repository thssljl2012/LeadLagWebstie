It&#8217;s just not fair! Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and other Senate Democrats have spent the last several weeks negotiating with major banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, hoping to come to a compromise on bankruptcy legislation that moved with great fanfare through the House in early March. Meanwhile, those banks&#8217; umbrella group, the American Bankers Association, has been whipping votes against it after having left the negotiating table in late March. Community banking groups and Senate minority whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) have also been whipping votes against it. Backers of the bill have been waiting to come up with a compromise to start whipping support, said a person familiar with the negotiations, and it appears to have backfired, with the banks picking up votes in opposition. The central debate is whether to allow bankruptcy judges to reduce &#8212; or cramdown &#8212; mortgages for homeowners who enter bankruptcy. The banking lobby strongly opposes allowing cramdown. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a key vote on the banking committee, dealt a blow to the bill Wednesday, telling the Huffington Post that he is &#8220;opposed to cramdown.&#8221; He went on: &#8220;I just think a deal&#8217;s a deal. I have a lot of empathy for folks who tend to get led astray, but I just think it&#8217;s going to create some problems - pretty obvious, actually. I don&#8217;t have to list them. I&#8217;m generally opposed. I don&#8217;t think it works well.&#8221; I am so fucking embarrassed that I raised money for this man. &#8220;A deal&#8217;s a deal&#8221;? Then let the banks collapse, too! The Durbin strategy, say three people familiar with the negotiations, was to come to a compromise with the banks first and then use the bank support to win the votes of conservative Democrats and a few Republicans to get the 60 needed to overcome a promised Republican filibuster. But that left the banks&#8217; umbrella group to lobby in a vacuum. &#8220;We are no longer at the negotiating table, but the concerns we have remain,&#8221; Peter Garuccio, a spokesman for the ABA, told the Huffington Post. &#8220;You&#8217;re right to say it&#8217;s kind of a vacuum right now,&#8221; said a Senate aide involved in the negotiations. &#8220;We&#8217;re still working to get a deal, but we don&#8217;t have a deal, so it&#8217;s hard to do the math&#8230;It&#8217;s premature to count votes on a bill that doesn&#8217;t exist yet.&#8221; The bill doesn&#8217;t exist yet, say negotiators, because the Senate is heavily rewriting the House version.
