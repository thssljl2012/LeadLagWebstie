I guess Barack took Rev. Wright seriously about US-KKK-A and all the world&#8217;s problems being caused by rich white people?  During a White House meeting last week between President Obama and CEOs of the nation&#8217;s top banks: Obama, for his part, told the bankers: My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks. &#8220;For his part&#8221; is a &#8220;foghorn leghorn&#8221; attempt by the Drive-by reporter to conceal the fact that the most powerful man on Earth is a Chicago thug.  You will notice that Obama&#8217;s vile lynching threat was directed at the bankers. Earlier in the story, the unnamed dead-tree writer of the Charlotte Observer&#8217;s &#8220;Insider: The Charlotte Business Scoop&#8221;, recounted that the Queen City&#8217;s own Ken Lewis, CEO of Bank of America, obviously joking, told the President: Mr. President, I am not going to suck up to Larry and Tim like the rest of these guys, referring to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Larry Summers, the head of the National Economic Council. The anonymous reporter referred to all this as &#8220;plain talk&#8221; in the column headline, in an obvious attempt to equate the two statements for obviously, if President Obama had replied to Lewis&#8217; statement immediately with the &#8220;pitchforks&#8221; comment, the reporter would have said so. No, Lewis&#8217; statement was not plain talk. It was obviously a joke meant to lighten the atmosphere given that the Administration was probably behind recent false rumors that Lewis was about to resign from BofA.  But Obama&#8217;s statement was oh so very plain. Plain for a mobster.  No one can say they weren&#8217;t warned of Obama&#8217;s chosen pals: indicted felon Tony &#8220;Obama house money from friend of Saddam Hussein&#8221; Rezko, terrorist Bill &#8220;should have bombed America more&#8221; Ayers and Jeremiah &#8220;G-D America&#8221; Wright. We even parodied Obama&#8217;s future presidency after a planet discovered by the USS Enterprise on Star Trek which had discovered a book on the Chicago gangs and organized its whole society around it. Fact imitates fiction. It has become impossible to parody Democrats anymore. But this satire ain&#8217;t funny. It&#8217;s chilling.  Da&#8217; Boss will call out the mob or pitchfork-wielding mobs if you don&#8217;t accept his &#8220;Piece of the Action.&#8221; Can anyone direct me to a fort to fire upon, or will the Union&#8217;s Commander in Chief fire the first shot this time? Or has it already been fired? Sound outrageous? I&#8217;ll tell you who is outrageous. Barack Hussein Obama, whether its threatening to lynch bank CEOs or denying medical care to babies outside the womb that survive abortions.
