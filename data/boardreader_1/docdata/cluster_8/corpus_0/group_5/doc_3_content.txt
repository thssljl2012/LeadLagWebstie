If you have a Citibank card, be sure to check your status online before you head out to Christmas shop.  They're raising just about everybody's interest rate in anticipation of the holiday rush, and you may not have noticed their subtle note in the mail.Some people will be paying 36% interest on their credit card purchases, and to make matters worse, Citibank is making the increase retroactive to every bit of money you owe them, no matter when you made the charge.  If you've been using the card as a source of revolving credit, you're going to pay dearly.I don't use credit cards.  No one should.Unfortunately, most do.
