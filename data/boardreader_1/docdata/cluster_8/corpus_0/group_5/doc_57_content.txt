Hay guysWatch out for ATM Skimming/Debit card fraud.http://www.scamwatch.gov.au/content/index.phtml/tag/CardSkimminghttp://www.snopes.com/fraud/atm/atmcamera.aspI must have used a dodgy ATM while in Sydney and yesterday got $300 stolen from me by some fucker replicating my card. :/They also kept tabs on how much money I had, my Netbank shows charges for "balance enquiries" at Westpac ATMS done in Sydney when I never use foreign ATMs and use Netbank (Commonwealth Bank) on my phone to check my balance anyways, so they waited until I got paid then yanked it away from me.So only use bank ATMS and avoid those generic "cash card"/"all banks" ATMs you find in convenience stores and pubs.Has anybody else been a victim of this? How long did it take before you got the money refunded? CBA is saying because it was taken from a Westpac ATM they need to "investigate it" with them first before I get my money back (2-3 weeks). WTF? I am in Melbourne, the money was withdrawn from Sydney. Clearly that's evident enough!!
