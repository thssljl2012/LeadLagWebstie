Okay, great.&amp;nbsp; It's Christmas eve.&amp;nbsp; i get to watch my children spaz about Santa tonight.&amp;nbsp; Great fun!&amp;nbsp; A huge ass fucking dinner at a friend's house, gift exchange--the works.&amp;nbsp; IT was going to be great.But check this out.&amp;nbsp; I got $80 from my grandparents(Yes, they're still alive) for Christmas.&amp;nbsp; I knew I was $55 in debt, and I thought, &amp;quot;Awesome!&amp;nbsp; I can get out of the red and still have money left over! 8D&amp;quot;WRONG!I go to my online banking, just to be sure.&amp;nbsp; I had, and I counted, 4 OVERDRAFT&amp;nbsp;FEES.&amp;nbsp; I am now, $160 in debt!&amp;nbsp; I was like, &amp;quot;WHAT&amp;nbsp;THE&amp;nbsp;FUCK&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;THIS?!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; So I called, and they told me my first overdraft fee was from a $2.15 charge on the 19th. (Here's what I read: charge- -$2.15. New ballance; $19.75)&amp;nbsp; I was supposedly overdrawn from THAT.&amp;nbsp; What. The. Hell.I argued with this woman(through she sounded like a man) for well over ten minutes.&amp;nbsp; By technicality, I should have only been charged 2 overdraft fees.&amp;nbsp; And this is why I hate Bank of America..But...anyway...now that I'm done with my tirade...Have a happy holiday everybody! 8D&amp;nbsp; Merry Chistmas and happy new year!&amp;nbsp; I don't have many resolutions this year...mostly because i never finish them.&amp;nbsp; ^^;
