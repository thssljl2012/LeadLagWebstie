AIG was one of the big receivers of our bailout money.  By &amp;quot;our&amp;quot;, I mean you, me, and anyone else in the US who pays taxes.  With the bailout, we technically own %79.9 of AIG.  We're loaning them $85 billion dollars to allow them to continue their business in the United States. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122156561931242905.html  Here's the kicker...  When the government bought AIG with our money, we also purchased AIG Takaful. http://www.aigmemsa.com/aig/takaful/aboutus.jsp  Be sure to read the part where they are &amp;quot;providing Shariah Compliant Insurance Solutions (Takaful)&amp;quot;.  Here's another link where AIG Takaful is now offering those same Shariah compliant policies in the US, AFTER we bailed them out.  http://www.insurancejournal.com/news...2/02/95930.htm  Here's the basics... The government is bailing out/purchasing companies in the US who are providing Shariah Law compliant services inside the US.  WITH OUR MONEY...  If you don't know what Shariah Law is, it would behove you to do some research on it.  The rabbit hole is getting deep...  Scary shit... :ninja:
