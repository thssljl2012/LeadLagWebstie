Are they protesting or taking a #2?  I can't tell... So, let me get this straight. We give a bailout to banks. The bailout was designed so that banks could continue giving a line of credit to businesses. Then, when a business starts having a hard time paying back the credit, the bank stops giving them the line of credit, even though we gave them a bailout so that they could give lines of credit to business who are having hard times. Way to go, Bank of America. You are really making it hard for me to pay that credit card bill this month. Just saying. From two dudes over at CNN: Bank of America, the giant lender, played a large role in the Republic factory closure when the bank, noting a decline in Republic&amp;#8217;s sales, cut off the company&amp;#8217;s line of credit. In normal times, this would have been considered prudent banking practice, but just last month Bank of America received $25 billion in a financial bailout meant to keep loans and credit flowing. Once the cameras stop rolling and once everyone forgets about them, these guys are going to be left out in the cold. Or, they might actually start something here. We all need to work together. Trust me, it isn&amp;#8217;t going to get any easier.
