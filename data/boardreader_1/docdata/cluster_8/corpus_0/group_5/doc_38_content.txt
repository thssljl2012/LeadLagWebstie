     With the increasing amount of shit that seems to land daily on the heads of the fucktards running Interpublic, news today that Nationwide Insurance has put it's account up for review, should come as no surprise. This $185 million account currently resides at Interpublic Group's TM Advertising in Dallas and the lead media incumbent is IPG's Universal McCann in New York. According to TM's chief douchenozzle, agency president Tom Hansen, they plan&amp;#0160;to defend. Yeah, right smart move you fucking bozo... Incumbents win about one out of every twenty million pitches. But hey, it's IPG's money, and it won't affect Michael Roth's humongous fucking &amp;quot;performance bonus.&amp;quot; So go ahead and blow it. As usual, the fucktard client is using ABA Consulting in Addison, Texas, to manage the process. Which is shorthand for the fact that Nationwide's marketing/advertising people are either totally unqualified, or completely shit scared to make the decision themselves... Even though, that's what they are paid to do... 'Cos, as their pathetic tagline states... Life comes at you fast. I need Michael Roth's address, so I can send him his Christmas present!
