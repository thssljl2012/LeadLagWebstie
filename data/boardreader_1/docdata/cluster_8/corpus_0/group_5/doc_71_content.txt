I've been thinking about writing this post for quite some time.   As most of you know I am a former home builder so I know a thing or two about commercial banking and this credit crisis thing that we're all hearing about daily or even hourly.As an aside, I'm even working this week on my first book about a Housing Recovery in 2009, but that's for another promotion and another time. I was meeting with one of my commercial bankers a few weeks back and got this exchange of information that really made me stop and ponder and think a bit:Banker:  "we will be pulling out of all our community banking lending, focusing entirely on BIG participation deals, in the billions where a few banks at the national level work together and share the risk"Me: "what happens to all these small businesses and car loans and doctors and self employed people that need community banks?"Banker:  "I guess they'll have to find new places to borrow, maybe credit unions or small local banks that can't get in on the big safe deals"Me:  "when does all this happen?"Banker:  "we'll be focused on workouts and getting rid of what we have now for the next two years, and then we won't replace very much of that activity with community lending"Now, for the sake of job security there's no way I'll reveal which of the Top 20 American banks thiss person works for, and I have paraphrased enough to keep myself from getting drawn into any of their problems.  They have your money in their banks though, and they won't be circulating that money to your communities and small businesses. I propose that you pull your money out of deposit and savings accounts in any Top 20 Bank in America today, and put it in a small local bank or credit union where lending will still occur.  Go ahead ask your Big Bank what they did with the federal bailout money, are they lending it?  I don't think so.
