Oh yeah, that's why I was supposed to be avoiding anyone who dealt through PayPal, the fuckers want my bank account details since I have reached some arbitrary limit and thus become untrustworthy.  Now I don't send them checks or anything, I use MBNA ShopSafe accounts, which are actually Bank of America one time use credit card numbers. So they always have my money instantly. But now I have to either apply for their credit card, and I don't want credit thankyou very fucking much, or give them my bank details.  I'd no more willingly give PayPal my bank details than I would screw a Portsmouth prostitute bareback.  So now I have an open order on Etsy that I said I'd pay for with PayPal and they won't process the order using the valid number I already gave them until I hand over my credentials.  NOT HAPPENING.
