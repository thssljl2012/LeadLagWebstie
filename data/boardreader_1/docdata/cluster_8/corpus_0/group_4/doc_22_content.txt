PART 1 of 2                            By            Marilyn Barnewall          November            28, 2008          NewsWithViews.com         To            whom should we listen about banking, the stock market, the economy?            There are so many differing analyses right now, it is difficult to know.                              One opinion is that Wall Street is sitting on $50 plus trillion in leveraged            assets and the United States government has a $5 to $6 trillion gross            domestic product (GDP). There is, this opinion says, no way to avoid            a total meltdown.         Today            I read an analysis by Stratfor, whose opinion I respect tremendously.            Stratfor says we must focus on the political realities, not the economy.            Using this strategy, Stratfor had been correct in predicting many things            Wall Street, the Treasury, the Fed, and economists around the world            have missed. Stratfor says we will have an ugly, painful recession,            but the fall of the housing markets will be trumped by the size            of the American economy. They see the core problem as the fall            of the housing markets and approach problem resolution from that perspective.         Like            Stratfor, I believe it is right to look at things from the geopolitical            perspective when defining our economic problems. Governments around            the world are acting in tandem  that in and of itself is a rare            occurrence  to solve the financial crisis and prevent            a meltdown.         Unlike            Stratfor, I do not believe the core of the geopolitical problem is the            value of housing. I believe the core problem is a worldwide government            bid to establish a global government. They have been trying to accomplish            this since the early 1900s. The people of the world do not want it and            so they must face crisis after crisis so potentially devastating to            modern life they can be frightened into accepting what the worlds            central banks want.         Now,            in some quarters, making that kind of statement gets one labeled a conspiracy            nut. Maybe I am a conspiracy nut. Maybe Im not. Maybe            those who prefer to look at the world through rose-colored glasses and            see governments as solving problems rather than causing them are the            conspiracy nuts. They conspire to trust governments around the world            until necks are safely held under the black boot of totalitarians.         What            is the conspiracy that makes them rather than me conspiracists            by definition?         They            believe governments are good, not self-surviving totalitarian organizations            that crave more and more power, more and more wealth. They believe the            Federal Reserve is looking out for the American people they even            think the Fed is part of the government.         All            I can say is, when one nut has more evidence on his or            her side than another nut, the one with the least evidence            must concede defeat and accept the title conspiracy nut.            It is obvious that I believe I have more evidence on my side of this            argument than do those who think governments around the world are driven            to do good for the people rather than oppressing them more and more.         Lets            go back in time.         How            was our financial services industry structured? This is an important            question because the regulations in place from the 1930s until the 1970s            were put in place to protect America from another Great Depression.         Savings            and loans were established as the primary underwriters of American mortgages.            When granting a mortgage, it is a 20 to 30 years financial commitment            by a lender. Because the world of business and consumer banking moves            quickly, and because the cost of funds are volatile, S&amp;Ls were established            for the specific purpose of making long-term mortgage loans. Commercial            banks did not make them. And, there was no problem with bank liquidity            because bank loan commitments are relatively short-term by comparison            to mortgages. A commercial bank must know from day-to-day that it has            sufficient funds on hand to deal with business and consumer borrowing            needs difficult to do when your deposits are tied up for 30-year            mortgages.         We            had Regulation Q. It said that savings and loans could offer one-quarter            of a percent more in savings interest than commercial banks. S&amp;Ls            were required to pay 5.50 for long-term savings and 5.25 percent for            short-term deposits. Commercial banks were required to pay 5.0 percent            on short-term savings and 5.25 percent on time savings             like a certificate of deposit or a time savings            account.         We            also had commercial banks. Their primary business was to take in deposits            for checking and savings deposits and loan that money out within the            community at a profitable rate. By doing so, they stimulated business            and, thus, job growth. They were not allowed to branch across state            lines. In many states (like Colorado, Illinois and Texas), they were            not allowed to branch within the state where a banks corporate            headquarters was located. When did that change and why?In            the mid-1970s, the Comptroller of the Currency (who has no authority            to change the laws passed by Congress its job is to oversee regulatory            control, not change it) issued an opinion that banks could become bank            holding companies. A bank holding company in non-branch banking states            (called unit banking states) could, in the Comptrollers opinion,            open other banks under the same bank name provided that each new bank            opened had its own Board of Directors, its own letterhead. It had to            be independent from the large bank that funded it.                   The creation of branch banks in non-branching states was a necessary            piece of the plan to implement interstate branching which would come            later.                   In Colorado, Governor Roy Romer all but promised the independent bankers            in the state that he would not support in-state branch banking. The            Colorado House passed House Bill 1111 banning interstate branch banking            on February 7, 1995. On February 21, 1995, the Senate approved its version            of the same legislation... banning interstate branch banking in Colorado.         However,            after receiving a telephone call from President Bill Clinton (and, it            is rumored, from NationsBank -- now Bank of America), Governor Romer            decided he wanted branch banking.          Clinton told Romer that all sorts of calamities would befall Colorado            banks if the branching legislation at the state level did not get passed.            Romer passed that information on to Tim Foster.          Foster was the Colorado House Speaker and pushed the legislature, having            been told Colorado would be in violation of the law if the legislation            did not pass. I called Foster right after the legislation passed and            asked him what in the world he thought he was doing, violating the laws            of the State of Colorado. He is the one who told me why he, a Republican,            became so supportive of getting legislation passed for a Democrat governor.            The above story is a direct quote from Foster.         Shortly            after the above transpired, Roy Romer was made the head of the Democrat            National Committee where he served for several years. Later he accepted            a highly-placed position with the Department of Education in California.            Foster has been the President of Mesa State College for a number of            years.         Why            did Bill Clinton make that phone call to Governor Roy Romer? Because.            The interstate banking plan could not be implemented unless all            50 states accepted branch banking and it was part of an overall plan            to implement the credit crisis we have today.         Once            all 50 states allowed branch banking, the Comptroller decided it was            okay for banks to use bank holding companies to establish banks in other            states a direct violation of the McFadden Act. Suddenly, we saw            First Interstate Banks all over the western United States. We saw NationsBank            of North Carolina owning banks in Florida and Citibank moved into California            and Arizona. Until this time, the McFadden Act prevented interstate            branch banking  intrastate branch banking laws were controlled            by each state. To my knowledge, the McFadden Act has never been over-turned            just ignored by the Congress.The            Honorable Louis T. McFadden, Congressman from Pennsylvania, leveled            charges at the Federal Reserve Board on the floor of Congress that would            have made the most aggressive conspiracy theorist blush.         McFadden            accused the Federal Reserve of swindling the U.S. Treasury, of conspiring            with their foreign principals (central banks in other nations) and others            to defraud the American government. Thus, the charges I would make against            the Federal Reserve in 2008 were first made in 1932 by a U.S. Congressman.                     As            if that were not enough, ...
