Chris Brogan, social media expert and evangelist, recently went to cash a check at a Bank of America branch. Bet that will be the last time he darkens the door at a BoA branch:Yesterday, I went into a Bank of America branch. I had a check from a customer of theirs and wanted to cash it. I was told that I would have to pay $6 because Im not a customer, too. Further, you made me stick my fingerprint on the check, because my signature is somehow not good enough.These two actions made me think several things:You dont want my business.You dont trust me. (Signatures are legal proof of consent everywhere else on the globe.)You dont want me doing business with that customer any more.Do any of those seem like good ideas in this economy? Do you want this kind of a blog post railing against your policies?I bank at The Provident Bank, a very small and useful bank. There arent a billion branches. There arent a billion employees. There arent several services that your bank probably offers.But they treat me nicely, they appreciate my business, and they dont charge me to interact with their customers.The next check I receive from Bank of America, Im going to send back to the person and ask them to choose a different instrument. Why? Because it shouldnt cost me $6 and an inky thumbprint to do business in 2008.Sincerely,Go to Hell.My wife has had similar experiences recently.And I wonder if BoA prides themselves on customer service, because if they do, perhaps they ought to give it another thought.
