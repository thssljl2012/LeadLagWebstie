I spoke to Paraiso Web Shop, and they agreed to sell fur wigs to me!!!  For a long time, I have waited and wanted to own more Paraiso wigs!  They are one of the best quality fur wigs available.  So I am very happy to be able to buy one.  I have told them which two wigs that I wanted to buy for my Volks Williams, and they can sell and ship them to me.  The only problem is that Paraiso needs a safe payment to their account in the SHINSEI BANK or JAPAN POST BANK.  I am so used to paying with Paypal.  Does anyone have any advice about sending payments to a bank in another country?  Is this possible through Paypal, or can I work with sending a payment through my Bank of America?Any advice or help is appreciated! Thank you!
