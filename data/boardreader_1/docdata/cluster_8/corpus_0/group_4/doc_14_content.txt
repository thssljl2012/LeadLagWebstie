&amp;nbsp; When browsing the internet, it is good to practice safe browsing habits. Here are some tips to help safeguard yourself from all kinds of problems.1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Do not give full names out to unknown or un-trusted people and do not post such information anywhere online.2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Do not give credit card numbers out unless the person or organization that is getting the information is trusted.3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Do not use a shared computer to shop on or transmit your credit card information, computers that are used by children and young adults are 100 times more likely to be infected with malware that will compromise your information. 4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Do not give out social security numbers. Be very careful what information is given out in chat rooms and e-mails. Do not give out phone numbers, addresses, social security numbers or any other sensitive information. 5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Be wary of people met online. Do not believe everything they say and beware when that "friend" starts asking for personal information.6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Beware when an online "friend" gives you a hard luck story about finances, ten asks for money. This is a common scam. 7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you meet someone online and they tell you "I love you" or they want to marry you, beware and be extremely suspicious. Next you could find yourself involved in a scam or credit card fraud ring.&amp;nbsp; 8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you're logging into a web page that requires a user name and password or any other sensitive information, make sure that web pages is the right page. For example if the link to Bank of America looks like www.bank0famerica.com (notice the "0" (zero) instead of the "o" (letter o) you will know it's a bad link because it's not www.bankofamerical.com, the legitimate site. In many cases false pages are crafted to look exactly like the legitimate ones. This is a common scam. Many times the links will come in your e-mail with a message threatening that the account will be shut down, or something of that nature. 10.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Be wary of such links in e-mail. It's a good idea to never click on links within an email message, even if the email looks like it came from a trusted source such as a bank, financial institution or friend.
