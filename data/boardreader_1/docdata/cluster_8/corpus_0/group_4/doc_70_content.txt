In a period where bailing out corporations is more trendy than Chihuahuas in Birkin bags, or "Change We Can Believe In," auto manufacturers are the next industry to get the ghetto government makeover.&amp;nbsp; If you recall, insurance giant AIG was granted up to $85 billion with which they could dip into so that they might remain an economic powerhouse and show that the government is willing to nurse its economy back to success.&amp;nbsp; This of course was followed by AIG sending its top executives on a lavish California retreat costing $444,000, to which the government got angry and responded with the harsh and dirty punishment of giving them an additional $37.8 billion, less than an hour after news of the retreat was released to the public.  Now, auto executives are meeting with the government to see how deep those government pockets go.&amp;nbsp; I have no problem with lending--no, not gift-wrapping--money to save the American auto industry.&amp;nbsp; However, just short of showing up to the hearings with all the strut and swagger of gold-chained well-hung pimps, each of the executives spared no expense of their image when they arrived via private jets.&amp;nbsp; This is the equivalent of standing in line at the soup kitchen with an all-gold set of teeth and a plate of lobster covered in calamari being spoon-fed to you by Donald Trump.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, are these companies testing their limits at this point?&amp;nbsp; "So I was told to show up before the committee on the hood of a Mercedes-Benz throwing IPods into the crowd while snorting cocaine off Barbara Bush's back.&amp;nbsp; AIG said it would be a good idea."
