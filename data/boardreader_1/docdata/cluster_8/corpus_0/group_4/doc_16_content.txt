Is this the type of conduct you expect from your government? This week the Federal Reserve refused to identify the recipients of almost $2 trillion of emergency loans from American taxpayers or the troubled assets the central bank is accepting as collateral. And, AIG, the insurance giant made infamous for having a $450,000 party for their executives after receiving their first bailout check eight weeks ago is now getting more money from the U.S. Treasury  taxpayers are now giving them a total of $150 billion. Well,lots ofpeople, including me,havehad enough. It's time for some tea-party type behavior. It's time to take advantage of the mechanisms that, though not nearly as much as they should be today, nevertheless still exist and are available to us as US citizens. It's time to 'Break The Bailout'. And, we know that the only way we are going to Break the Bailout and create an economy for the people and not the banksters is to get organized and work together. So, weve started a transpartisan campaign  Break the Bailout  visit www.BreakTheBailout.com to see what were planning.   Essentially, were going to build a community, a citizens movement, to fight for the economy we want and to Break the Bailout. Were going to be delivering blowback on the bailout to elected officials who are supposed to represent the people  the voters who put them in office  not big banks and Wall Street. We know the country is outraged and were going to redirect that outrage into constructive action. Were going to educate the voters on what the bailout really means and organize them to demand change. I'd like to ask you to take a look at our new website, www.breakthebailout.com and then do whatever you think is right. But I'll warn you: There's some very startling facts on that site. These high-finance types and 'professional' politicos don't want us to know what they're really doing. They want to keep us locked in the cellar of ignorance because they know that the actions they're taking are not in the best interests of the citizens of our country. Please be informed on this issue. I don't know about you but I'm tired of always hearing that America is wrong and I'm tired of the growing feeling that our government doesn't take us seriously.
