OK, so I haven't been as active blogging the past week as I had up until the grand statement that the United States made eight days ago.&amp;nbsp; (Talk about denouncing and repudiating a whole ideology!&amp;nbsp; Way to go, my fellow citizens!)&amp;nbsp; As some of you know, since I closed on a house on October 23rd, I've been busy transitioning my worldly goods from the apartment into the house, with the biggest effort occurring on Saturday the 7th, when my good friend Steve (thanks again!) helped me load the furniture and some boxes into a 14-foot UHaul (which had Arizona plates) for the forty miles trip on rain-slicked roads. Of course, this whole experience has me feeling somewhat separated or split, because I'm not entirely in either residence--still sleeping at the apartment on an air mattress, as I gradually box and move the remaining odds and ends of my belongings, but most of my possessions are now at the house--and thus I feel somewhat like two selves or none at all.&amp;nbsp; It is a weird sensation, if it is a sensation.&amp;nbsp; I'm not exactly sure how to describe it. If I were not teaching fulltime this month, I would have already completed the transition and would be reconciling myself to my new surroundings.&amp;nbsp; When I last moved, in July 2001, I was able to finish the relocation within two weeks, but I wasn't in the classroom or the office at all during that month.&amp;nbsp; Trying to balance my time and energy between moving stuff and grading student essays has not been easy, and I have to admit my work sometimes has taken a back seat.&amp;nbsp; Not intentionally.&amp;nbsp; For instance, this morning, when I awoke two hours before my alarm, I suddenly realized I had completely forgotten to make my notes and prepare for my Legends of King Arthur class:&amp;nbsp; we are reading a book I've read before but have not yet taught, so I need to spend some time adding margin noted to assist my failing memory in recalling the items I hope to highlight from the chapters we are reading. At the same time I am making the move, the apartment complex where I have been living is in the process of being transitioned from the previous landlord to a new one.&amp;nbsp; This afternoon was the preclosing walkthrough, and Thursday morning the closing is scheduled.&amp;nbsp; So, in addition to my own reactions to my personal transition, I have a new landlord to workwith when I seek my security deposit.&amp;nbsp; I have not yet met this gentleman, though one of my neighbors has on several occasions.&amp;nbsp; So I am not sure how everything will work out in that regard.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, with my apartment largely bare of furnishings and with stuff sitting on the floor waiting to be moved, as well as the end-of-move cleaning still to follow, the new landlord probably won't think too keenly of the place, as it currently stands.&amp;nbsp; But I will leave it in better shape than it is now:&amp;nbsp; I always do that when I move out. Now some of you are probably wondering how I will (or whether I will) connect this personal experience of moving residences to something happening in the world of politics today.&amp;nbsp; At first, when I began writing my reflections, I didn't have that in mind.&amp;nbsp; But given the way the economy seems to be still tanking despite the patch job that Treasury Secretary Paulson and others have attempted to do, I probably have to say something.&amp;nbsp; So here goes. The way I feel right now, caught between two residences but not feeling really a part of either, is probably similar to the way many Americans feel about their own situation, with their investments, 401K, retirement plans, even their homes, seemingly kicked out from under them.&amp;nbsp; They feel dislocated from either their recent past or their intended future, and it's like they woke up two hours before their alarms and realized the whole world was sitting on their chest saying, "Remember me???" And all of the options facing us are uncertain, because none of us have ever stared at the gaping mouth of a worldwide financial depression before.&amp;nbsp; Most of the proposed solutions involve borrowing (or printing up) large sums of money to plug the holes in existing corporate structures and ways of doing business.&amp;nbsp; But that seems like throwing pearls into the toilet:&amp;nbsp; what's to keep them from being flushed, too?&amp;nbsp; The business practices that have been developing over the past thirty-plus years have resulted in a big mess, and that suggests to me that we need a different approach.&amp;nbsp; The trickle-down economic theories advocated from Reagan to the present have not worked--or, at least, they have not fostered healthy business practices in the upper echelon of the economy.&amp;nbsp; There may have been some merit to the theory itself, but its practice was poorly conceived.&amp;nbsp; Too many economic decisionmakers made decisions that may have had shortterm profitability, but which had longterm downsides that undermined the economic wellbeing of the companies and of the entire economy.&amp;nbsp;  And now the American taxpayers are expected to pay for the repairs to the dike after the entire Atlantic has flooded the lowlands that were supposed to be safe from any oceanic incursions.&amp;nbsp; Or rather, our children and grandchildren will be paying the debt off.&amp;nbsp; Because the federal government doesn't have the money to bail out the banks and other corporate entities whose leadership has created the economic disaster.&amp;nbsp; We already have an accumulated federal budget deficit of over $10 trillion, and if paying off that debt is anything like my total payments will be for my 6% mortgage, in which over thirty years I will end up paying the bank more than double the original price of the house (because interest compounds like the incestuous, inbred thing it is), our children and grandchildren will end up spending $25 trillion to pay off the existing federal debt, and even more if we add to it now. I'm not saying that we should sit by idly and watch the entire economic house of cards come tumbling down.&amp;nbsp; But when we hand over $152 billion (the current figure) to bail out insurance behemoth AIG, whose executives were caught recently spending company money for spa treatments or some such nonsense, we are simply throwing money into a large sucking hole. And now the US automakers want their share of the pie, asking for a mere $30 billion to tide them over.&amp;nbsp; If it weren't for the simple fact that around 1 million people would be unemployed if GM, Chrysler, and Ford went belly up, I'd say, "No pie for the Big Three."&amp;nbsp; The US auto industry is a hulking, outdated, ineffectual, irrelevant dinosaur.&amp;nbsp; They have invested most of their resources into building huge, gas-guzzling monstrosities that are useless and meaningless in a world where the "cheap" gas is $2.25.9 and where most people can't steer their two-ton weapons of mass destruction between the dotted lines.&amp;nbsp; None of the US automakers has a car that can average more than 40 miles per gallon on the highway--this in spite of the fact that, for the past nearly forty years, we have been well aware that our days of chugging fossil fuels are numbered and we should have alternative options in hand long before the last drops of petroleum seep out of a Middle Eastern oilwell. If the US government helps the automakers out in their time of reckoning, the aid should come with serious strings attached.&amp;nbsp; GM, Chrysler, and Ford should be required to have NO cars which achieve less than 40 miles per gallon on the highway--and they should be forced to reach that goal by 2015.&amp;nbsp; (If they reach it sooner, their debt to the government can be, in part, forgiven.)&amp;nbsp; They should be required to develop alternative fuel cars and to have those available and fully accessible (with fuel distribution sites in place) by 2018.&amp;nbsp; The petroleum-based automobiles should be able to be gradually phased out by 2030.&amp;nbsp; America should be in the forefront of innovation, not playing catchup behind the European and Japanese automakers. Some people might say that it is not to government's business to tell private industry what to do.&amp;nbsp; Uh, folks, remember that our government is "we the people" and all that.&amp;nbsp; And if the government--that's us, folks--is lending money to GM, Chrysler, and Ford, we have every right to specify how it is to be used.&amp;nbsp; If we were making out our last will and testament, we would have the right to tell our heirs how they can (or cannot) use the funds we bequeath them.&amp;nbsp; So pretend we are giving the Big Three our lifetime of earnings and savings:&amp;nbsp; shouldn't we then have the same right to set requirements as to how they can (and cannot) use the funds we bequeath them? In any case, we need to take action that both resolves the economic crisis and also takes steps to ensure that what follows will not merely be a repeat of this mess some five to ten years in the future.&amp;nbsp; We have the opportunity to fix things NOW.&amp;nbsp; If we do only a partial fix now, we will have to revisit the same problems again in a year, two years, in President Obama's second term, etc.&amp;nbsp; Let's save ourselves some future angst and fix the problems now, for good. In the meantime, I'm going to finish moving.&amp;nbsp; And clean up the old apartment.&amp;nbsp; And be nicely settled in the house before Thanskgiving. . . .&amp;nbsp;
