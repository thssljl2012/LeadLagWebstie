Nightly Roundup  It was just another day in the life of a conservative in the newest "socialist paradise."&amp;nbsp; Peace, bread and land!&amp;nbsp;   Rock the Vote 2008  I read somewhere tonight that the vote count is up to 132 million people in 2008.&amp;nbsp; If Obama got 64 million votes and McCain got 56 million votes that only adds up to 120 million.&amp;nbsp; There were about 1.5 million 3rd party votes cast.&amp;nbsp; Am I missing something or did someone not catch a typo?&amp;nbsp;   Can You Say US Auto Company  It looks like we will be nationalizing the auto makers of America.&amp;nbsp; The surest way to know it will happen is for Bush to indicate he doesn't support it.&amp;nbsp; But, either Bush will do it or Obama will do it.&amp;nbsp; If you thought the "Yugo" was cutting edge in automotive technology just wait to you see cars designed by Obama &amp;amp; Company.&amp;nbsp; The price tag is now only $50 billion to bail them out.&amp;nbsp; I suggest Bush takes the first offer because the price tag seems to double every couple of weeks.&amp;nbsp;   Great Deals on Electronics and Insurance  Circuit City filed for bankruptcy today.&amp;nbsp; If you work in Richmond, Virginia there are now only two employers left in town.&amp;nbsp; One is CarMax and the other is Capital One.&amp;nbsp; Get down to your local Circuit City before they sell out of everything.&amp;nbsp;   And it is a great time for a deal for insurance, if you are AIG!&amp;nbsp; $65 billion not enough?&amp;nbsp; Do your tired execs need another week at the spa at taxpayer expense?&amp;nbsp; Well, has Uncle Sam got a deal for you!&amp;nbsp; Hank Paulson has now "invested" a sweet $150 billion in AIG.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, there appears to be no end in sight.&amp;nbsp; Like I said, if you thought $700 billion was the end you haven't seen anything yet.&amp;nbsp;   Rain, Sleet or Snow?  The US Postal Service is rumored to be considering 40,000 layoffs.&amp;nbsp; It will be the first layoffs ever!&amp;nbsp; I guess email has really started to take a toll.&amp;nbsp; Of course, if they would stop subsidizing junk mail at the expense of regular folks they might be able to make money off of the mail.&amp;nbsp; But, then again, government can't do anything right.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, do you really want your health care run like the post office and DMV?&amp;nbsp;   Client Number 9 Avoids Criminal Charges  Elliot Spitzer, aka Client Number 9, aka the former governor of New York, will NOT face criminal charges for engaging the services of a prostitute.&amp;nbsp; Oh, that's right, this is NOT news.&amp;nbsp; He is a Democrat.&amp;nbsp; Only Republicans are charged with crimes.&amp;nbsp; What was I thinking?&amp;nbsp;
