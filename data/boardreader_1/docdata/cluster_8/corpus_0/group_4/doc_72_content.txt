It&amp;#8217;s been a quiet week for me here. Ive gone round the shops a couple of times (I was on the hunt for lightweight pants and a cellphone case. Found the pants, have given up on the case), worked on my freelance site quite a bit, done things like the laundry and grocery shopping. Last night I went out for a really yummy Thai dinner with Elisa. I&amp;#8217;ve been craving noodles like mad, but Im not sure yet where to find the kind I want. Joy spoiled me in Taiwan by taking me to all sorts of incredible noodle spots, Im sure that since Auckland has a sizeable Chinese population I will be able to find some here. Socially we&amp;#8217;ve quieted down quite a bit (last weekend was a bit manic), but tonight should be noisy. Elisa&amp;#8217;s sister is moving to Australia and her going away party is tonight, then we&amp;#8217;re all off to see Booka Shade. Should be good times! As I wrote on Monday, I needed to take care of a lot of mundane day-to-day stuff like opening a bank account, and transfering money from my Canadian account to my Kiwi one. Here is what I&amp;#8217;ve learned. Money, money, money Banking I opened an account at Westpac, since they have a no fee electronic bank account (they also have savings accounts with 8% interest!). Because I dont have a permanent address here, or any mail with my name on it, I had to get Elisa to write me a letter on a utility bill stating that I was indeed living here.  Once I had that, and my passport in hand, I was able to open up an account without any trouble. Because it&amp;#8217;s no fee banking (not even a monthly service charge!), every deposit I make costs me $3.00, since it requires a teller to actually count the money. Im okay with that! After spending $12+ a month for years at TD, I dont mind paying for each service as I actually use it. Transfering money from Canada All of the world banks seem to have an unwritten agreement to make transfering money between countries as difficule as possible. There is no simple way to do this. Your options are:  Obtaining an International Money Order from your Canadian bank before leaving. This has several draw backs, the largest being that if you lose it en route, you&amp;#8217;re fucked. Since I was making stops in Hong Kong and Kaohsiung, this was ruled out right away. If you do decide to use this method, you should know that your new bank will hold the money order for up to 30 days while it mails it BACK to Canada and verifies funds. The Age of Electronic Banking? Not so much. Travellers Cheques. This is a time-honoured method, but a bit cumbersome, as do you really want to be carrying $5000+ in TC around? Sure it&amp;#8217;s ensured if you lose them or if they are stolen, but that would be quite the wad. Plus it&amp;#8217;s expensive. Maybe if you can get $1000 denominations it would be all right &amp;#8230; Ordering enough foreign currency to last you a while, then arranging for a wire transfer once in your new country. This is what I went with. I ordered $500 NZD, figuring it would be simple enough to arrange the transfer for the rest later. I was half right. I called my bank this morning (collect, yaay) and found out that the only way to get my money here would be to write a letter asking my home branch to move the money by wire (for a $30 fee), and send the letter by fax. I dont exactly have a fax machine handy, so this (combined that it takes a few days for the transfer to go through) doesnt work for me either. Instead, this brought me to my final solution: Withdrawing the maximum amount from my CDN account via the ATM. TD Canada Trust charges $5 per international withdrawl (unless you have an account that waives the fees, but in turn charges you $25 a month in fees), and until this morning, put a weekly cap of $1000CDN on my account. If you decide to go this route, make sure you ask the bank to put the maximum limit on your account. Now I can withdraw up to $1200 per day, up to $3000 a week. Much better. Of course, it still costs me $5 each time I hit the bank, but at least now I will have all of my money here by the end of the weekend.  I find it criminal that it will have cost me over $30 to have access to my own money, but there really wasnt an alternative. I asked both Westpac and TD for the best possible solution, and neither bank had anything constructive to tell me. I suppose I could have gone with an HSBC (&amp;#8221;The World&amp;#8217;s Bank&amp;#8221;) account for the express purpose of moving money, but they only have one branch here in Auckland, so at the time it didnt seem to make much sense. Perhaps if you&amp;#8217;re reading this and looking for advice it&amp;#8217;s something that may work for you. Another thing I could have done was find out which Canadian banks were affiliated with NZ banks, and opened up an account with them, as Im told there is no fee for moving money between affiliates. To do this, you&amp;#8217;d have to into the CDN bank and get International Money Transfer forms, then once in your new country, fill them out with the affiliated bank&amp;#8217;s information and fax them back to Canada. In my friend&amp;#8217;s case, he moved money from NZ to Canada this way, and while it took a few days, he paid no fee.
