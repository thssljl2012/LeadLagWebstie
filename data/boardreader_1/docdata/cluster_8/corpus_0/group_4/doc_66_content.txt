i think it's time to wake up to the new world.as barclays receives fresh injections from the middle east to the tune of a mere 14billion.realise this that the age of overleveraging and making money out of empty money is over...for now at least.the days when you could swindle money out of people who made money as easy as it has left them are also over.with no excess money to churn nor rising asset prices to sell and make money off, there is no easy money now.it's true the economy will go on as it has. but shrink it will.and people who are more interested in the world we once lived in in 2001-2007 will find it doesn't exist.those who have sneaked into organisations with fake resumes, connections, altruism, and such cronyism, should be flushed out by the demands for efficiency and cost cutting.
