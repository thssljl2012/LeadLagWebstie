 I did a quick check on the various banks' interest rates after RBA reduced the cash rate to 5.25%. Westpac eSaver - 5.1%Commonwealth Netbank Saver - 5%ING Savings Maximiser - 5.5%BankWest Telenet Saver - 5.55%, promotional rate 5.85%, new customer 6.35% till 1/1/09HSBC Serious Saver - 5.75%ANZ Online Saver - 6%My bank pays the highest interest! (Well, after BankWest of course...that one is for the time being only okay....)I also just found out that HSBC Australia doesn't charge monthly account keeping fee. I might switch to that before I go home. Hmmmm....
