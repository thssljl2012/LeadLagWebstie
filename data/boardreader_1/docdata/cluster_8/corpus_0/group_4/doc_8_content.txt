The federal government has just guaranteed up to $306 billion of Citigroup&amp;#8217;s assets in returnfor $7 billion of preferred shares in the financial institution. Although the deal fails to grant Uncle Sam a seat on the board at one of the world&amp;#8217;s largest banks, the U.S. government will soon become the bank&amp;#8217;s largest shareholder. As our nation continues its steady march towards the nationalization of industry, let us pause and reflect upon some of the ugly realities of social planning. First and foremost, social planning never&amp;#8211;I repeat, never&amp;#8211;works as planned. It is the poster child of the old saw that begins, &amp;#8220;The best laid plans of mice and men&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221; History has given us painful example after example of why F. A. Hayek was right when he posited that &amp;#8220;the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess.&amp;#8221; In other words, no one individual or group can or does know everything,therefore social planning can never be completely effectivebecausetotal knowledge is required. Butwe neednot linger too muchin the past because we are now being offered fresh examples of social planning&amp;#8217;s sometimes dangerous inefficiencies. The American public has already been forced to swallow the bitter pill of a $700 billion dollar financial industry bailout, which included Citigroup. Now we are told that Citigroup&amp;#8217;s original lifeline wasn&amp;#8217;t enough; we&amp;#8217;re now on the hook for an additional$300 billion for Citigroup alone. The first bailout, meticulously crafted by the finest policy wonks money can buy, was supposed to magically stabilize markets, thaw credit, and stimulate consumer spending. It failed on all three counts. However, never to be thwarted by the recalcitrant machinations ofheartless capitalism, the social planners in Washington have taken more money out of our pockets (without our consent) and thrown it down the samebottomless hole. When does the gravy train reach the end of the line? Not anytime soon, I&amp;#8217;m afraid, because the realm of social planning is also the ghetto of unintended consequence. The recent bailout of Citigroup has given them a decided edge over competitors like Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase. With the federal government as its backstop, some analysts argue that the bank will &amp;#8220;be able to borrow money in the capital markets at lower rates than its peers&amp;#8221; (New York Times). It&amp;#8217;s only a matter of time before the disadvantaged banks line up on the steps of Capitol Hill for their own handouts, and the federal government that created the disadvantage in the first place will be hard-pressed to denythe banks&amp;#8217;requests. There&amp;#8217;s also the issue of moral hazard, made doubly perilous with the bailout of Citigroup. It&amp;#8217;s bad enough for taxpayers that banks knowthe government will ride to the rescue with cash in hand; insult is added to injury when the bankscan leveragethe government to bail them out in the name of fairness. Knowing they can force the government&amp;#8217;s hand, banks can engage in risky conduct for short-term gains at the cost of long-term liquidity because Uncle Sam will catch them when they fall. But wait. There&amp;#8217;s more. We&amp;#8217;ve already seen the American auto industry lining up for it&amp;#8217;s share of the government dole. And why not? At the very moment when our pursestrings should be tight, the social planners are emptying the till. The Democratic majority on Capitol Hill&amp;#8211;with help from various &amp;#8220;compassionate conservatives,&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m sure&amp;#8211;hope to have a $500 billion giveaway on President-elect Obama&amp;#8217;s deskon his first day in the Oval Office. This is an example of what one reporter for the New York Times describes as &amp;#8220;aggressive, yet centrist, policies.&amp;#8221; If by &amp;#8220;centrist&amp;#8221; the reporter means &amp;#8220;central planning,&amp;#8221; I completely agree. It should come as no surprise that other industries are lobbying aggressively for their own seat at the bailout dinner table. The Associated Press today reports that the National Association of Realtors and other businesses reliant on the housing sector are asking for their own stimulus package of $50 billion. Spearheading the call for mortgage subsidies by the federal government are two of the nation&amp;#8217;s largest homebuilders, Lennar Corp. and D.R. Horton, Inc. With home sales declining as a function of reduced financing, homebuilders argue that mortgage subsidies would enable those who currently cannot afford to finance a hometo be able to do so. More buyers means more construction, which means more profit for those in the housing sector. If only the government&amp;#8211;which in our republican democracy is you and I&amp;#8211;would pay the difference between what homebuyers can afford to borrow and what homebuilders wish to charge, then more people would have a piece of the American Dream and housing sector businesses would flourish. Everybody wins&amp;#8211;except the taxpayer. It was moral hazard in one form or another that got us into this economic mess, and yet here we are again encouraging individuals and entitities to continue their risky financial behaviors by entertaining bailouts and stimulus packages that have so far shown little efficacy. Remember that Citigroup&amp;#8217;s first bailout package was supposed to cure its ills; when the bank failed to raise enough capital from private investors to shore up its finances, it came right back to Uncle Sam with hat in hand. After all, why let pesky ol&amp;#8217; capitalism stand in your way when you can count on the social planners in Washington to rob the citizenry for you?
