Is there anyone else out there who is struggling to get their banking done in a timely manner with Bank of America? I&amp;#8217;ve never been so frustrated. Just wondering if anyone else finds the largest bank to be the biggest pain in the rear end when it comes to depositing checks and accessing funds&amp;#8230;?
