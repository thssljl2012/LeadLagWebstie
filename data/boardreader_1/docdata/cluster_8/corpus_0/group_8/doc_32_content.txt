The Financial Times reports: Lewis Alexander, Citigroups chief economist, is leaving the bank to join the US Treasury department, according to a memo Citibank sent out on Tuesday. Mr Alexander will work as an adviser to Timothy Geithner, US Treasury secretary, on domestic financial issues. You mean like the domestic financial crisis we in that this guy took part in creating? Just more proof that there is no difference between government and corporations anymore. It&#8217;s a revolving door. When corporations takes over government, we call that fascism!
