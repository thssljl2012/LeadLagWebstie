 Screw you homeowners.signed,multi-national corporations clipped from www.truthdig.comWeve already given AIG a total of $170 billionan amount that dwarfs the $75 billion allocated to helping those millions of homeowners facing foreclosures. And more will be thrown down the AIG rat hole because President Barack Obama is blindly following the misguided advice of his top economic advisers, who insist that AIG is too big to fail. AIG provides insurance protection to more than 100,000 entities, including small businesses, municipalities, 401(k) plans and Fortune 500 companies who together employ over 100 million Americans, the joint Treasury Department and Fed statement declared while insisting that for that reason, plus the systemic risk AIG continues to pose and the fragility of markets today, the potential cost to the economy and the taxpayer of government inaction would be extremely high.dont understand what AIG has been up to, because the company was allowed to operate in an essentially unregulated global economy in which multinational corporations have their way.
