 Chris Dodd, the senior senator from Connecticut, has a lot of problems. His re-election campaign in 2010 being the biggest one. But he's got this one right. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Christopher Dodd on Monday suggested a tax provision to recoup the bonuses for executives of ailing insurance giant AIG.Dodd, D-Connecticut, said the notion is in the "earliest of thinking" and has not been settled on as a way to resolve the issue, which has set off outrage in Washington and across the country.The tax would apply only to those at AIG who have received bonuses. The provision would help the government get back the money in the form of tax revenue. The idea would be to set a tax rate on bonus money for bank executives at banks who have a certain amount of their stock held by the government. And the percentage being tossed around right now would apply to only AIG.This is a blunt weapon to be sure. But if AIG is going to hide behind the contracts and this "best and brightest" B.S., then you do what you need to do.
