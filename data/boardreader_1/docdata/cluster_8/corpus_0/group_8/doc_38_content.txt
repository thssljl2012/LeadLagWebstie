First, a pleasant diversion:      Imagine that:  we have a President who knows that other nations have their own holidays!  It is nice that our country is no longer being run by C students.  Yin:  this latest &#8220;tax the hell out of AIG bonus money&#8221; might have unintended, unfortunate consequences (via Nate Silver)  I&#8217;d call this the law of unintended consequences &#8212; except that the consequences are explicitly written into the bill. The bonus tax, which passed the House earlier today, applies not only to AIG but also to some 12 other firms that received substantial levels of government assistance. This includes both financial institutions like AIG and nonfinancial ones like General Motors; it includes banks that are preforming poorly, like Citibank, and those that are holding up fairly well, like JPMorgan Chase and PNC. The government has dictated that nobody at anybody of these companies is deserving of incentive-based compensation, unless their household income is less than $250,000 per year. Just think about some of the implications of this. A senior engineer at General Motors, who shepherds the production of a new hybrid vehicle that will turn out to be a best-seller, shouldn&#8217;t get a bonus for that. Really? Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan, who has managed his company&#8217;s assets adeptly and kept it mostly off the taxpayer&#8217;s dole, is no more deserving of a bonus than an AIG crook. Really? An mid-level investment banker at Morgan Stanley, who works her butt off to persuade her bosses to facilitate a deal for a new wind-power company that turns out to be a big economic and environmental winner, should have her incentive compensation taxed at 90%. Really? An administrative assistant at PNC, who is volunteering to work 70-hour weeks because of cutbacks in the company&#8217;s staff, deserves a Christmas Bonus &#8212; unless her husband happens to be a lawyer earning $250,000 per year, in which case it should be taken away. Really? $500,000 in salary for an employee that performs badly is perfectly fine, but a $500,000 bonus for one who performs exceptionally well isn&#8217;t. Really? [...]  On the other hand, I still hate the arrogant bastards at AIG (though, as President Obama said, hatred can&#8217;t drive our policies).  Here is one reason why: Just when you couldn&#8217;t stand to hear another thing about AIG, this comes out: A.I.G. Sues U.S. for Return of $306 Million in Tax Payments     While the American International Group comes under fire from Congress over executive bonuses, it is quietly fighting the federal government for the return of $306 million in tax payments, some related to deals that were conducted through offshore tax havens.     A.I.G. sued the government last month in a bid to force it to return the payments, which stemmed in large part from its use of aggressive tax deals, some involving entities controlled by the companys financial products unit in the Cayman Islands, Ireland, the Dutch Antilles and other offshore havens.     A.I.G. is effectively suing its majority owner, the government, which has an 80 percent stake and has poured nearly $200 billion into the insurer in a bid to avert its collapse and avoid troubling the global financial markets. The company is in effect asking for even more money, in the form of tax refunds. The suit also suggests that A.I.G. is spending taxpayer money to pursue its case, something it is legally entitled to do. Its initial claim was denied by the Internal Revenue Service last year.  I bet if the lawyers win the case they&#8217;ll ask for a bonus.  But such arrogant &#8220;we can do whatever we want&#8221; attitudes has its consequences  AIG boss Edward Liddy says he fears for his employees&#8217; lives if Congress goes through with a threat to name and shame recipients of lavish bonuses awarded by the bailed-out insurer. Reading out lurid death threats received by AIG, including a vow to garrotte executives with piano wire, Mr Liddy said he could only release the names of the bonus recipients if Congress promised to keep them confidential. &#8220;I would hope that it doesn&#8217;t take a subpoena. I&#8217;m just really concerned about the safety of our people,&#8221; he told a hearing in the House of Representatives. But financial services committee chairman Barney Frank said he could not guarantee confidentiality and said he would press ahead with subpoenas if needed. &#8220;Clearly those threats are despicable. But this is an important public subject,&#8221; the Democrat said. &#8220;I will consult with the federal law enforcement people and if they do say there&#8217;s a credible threat, we will have to take that into consideration,&#8221; he said.
