         That $850 billion bank bailout is a failure. AIG, once world's largest insurance company is now on its 4th bailout. This drain of money has got to stop. It is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. How much more money do we throw on the flaming inferno of greed.The gov now says that we might have a mild depression, but not as bad the the Great Depression of the 1930's. Hey guys, please wake up, the financial hurricane is here. This is not a drill, we are going DOWn!Labels: bailout
