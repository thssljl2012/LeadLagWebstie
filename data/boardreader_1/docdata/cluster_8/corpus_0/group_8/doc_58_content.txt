Some people think there&#8217;s going to be a light at the end of the tunnel, soon, with respect to the financial markets. Last year the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DOW) was at 13,941. Today (2/17/09), following the signing of the new stimulus package, it closed at 7,552. Personally, I think all this is a historic cycle coming into action. The world, and certainly the American public would have had to pay the piper, so to speak, for decades of over-spending, lack of saving, and disregard for reality. As such, I suspect we won&#8217;t see the end of this slide until we approach the 4,000 mark. February 17, 2008 DOW 13,191 March 20, 2009 7,278 Loss: 44.8% America is being held hostage by corrupt politicians whose entire lives are devoted to the single goal of staying in office. Those politicians haven&#8217;t the slightest interest in the American public. They have zero interest in fixing anything, and would prefer to have high anxiety and fear running rampant. The more anxiety, the better their chances of re-election. How long will it be before the population gets really angry about the real cause of our problems: the government?
