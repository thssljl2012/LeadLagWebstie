..Affirmative Action played major role in economic meltdown March 7th, 2009 2005-2008 President and CEO of Fannie Mae called the Congressional Black Caucus the conscience of Fannie Mae! See more proof straight from the mouths of leading Clinton officials! Watch Bill Clintons HUD secretary brag about forcing banks to give out race based loans. Then when asked, he admits that these same race-based loans would be more likely to fail! Watch Barack Obama himself admit his involvement in forcing banks to give reckless race-based loans!Barack Obama called subprime loans a good idea. He personally sued Citibank in 1994 to force them to give more loans to unqualified blacks!Citibank is now in shambles and a major recipient of the massive bank bailout. Barack Obama was at the FOREFRONT of forcing banks to give race-based loans for much of the past twenty years! Now Obama wants to give $275 million bailout to low income [ie Black &amp; Hispanic] borrowers that recieved loans they couldnt afford. Obama was a leading player in forcing these banks to give the borrowers loans they couldnt afford in the first place! This has come full circle, and Obamas policies will only wreck the economy even worse. MORE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;..
