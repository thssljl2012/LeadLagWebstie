  Retirement Recovery Insurance   By Jim NelsonOctober 21, 2008  Dear Penny Sleuth  Reader,  The market continues to flounder and Americans cannot help but cringe at the sight of their 401(k) balances. Under the circumstances, it sure would be nice to have some cheap insurance to guard against future collapses such as this.  Well, our colleague Dan Amoss is looking to provide you with a tool for just that purpose. In his brand-new report, he teaches you how to take advantage of a "hidden" government document that lets you gain on crashing stocks  But you only have until October 28 at 11:00 a.m. to cash in, so read on  Sincerely, Jim Nelson &amp;nbsp;                  Breaking "Retirement Recovery" Alert:              Fired Auto Worker Quadruples His Money With "Retirement Recovery Insurance". . . During the Worst Market         Bust in Recent Memory!                       "I'm making more now than I made during my last three years at work," he tells me. "I almost feel guilty at all the money I've made."                   And he's not alone.                   In the most violent 'whipsaw' market since the 1930s, this handful of stock market players and amateurs combined say they're already up 327%... 250%... 491%... 292%... 372%... and 567%...                   Even as just about all the highest profile and so-called "safe bet" blue chip stocks on Wall Street have crashed and burned!                   The letter below explains how &amp;mdash; but you only have until Tuesday, Oct. 28th at 11 A.M. to cash in...                        Dear Friend,              Bill Reading, a former mechanical engineer, just lost his job.                       Does he care?              Not at all...              Says Bill, "I've been making more money in the markets than at work for the last three years," even as markets worldwide come crashing down.              On one move, Bill tells me he's already up over 300%.              "In fact," Bill wrote to me in an email, "I feel almost guilty at all the money I've made."                  And he's not alone...              I recently heard from Dr. Ted Stanley. Ted acted on a move I wrote about in a special report last summer. On that one move, he says he made 222% gains in just a few weeks.              Then Ted went back and did it again for another 441%!              That's enough to grow every $10,000 into nearly $55,000. Almost overnight.              And neither Ted or Bill had to invest a single dime in risky stocks to make this work.              My research showed Paul J. how to do this too.              He just wrote in to tell me he used it to make a 567% haul smack in the middle of this past September, one of the worst months on record for Wall Street.              Start to finish, Paul's profitable move took him a little over four months to complete.              And he writes to tell me he's ready for more.              So is former stock broker and insurance agent Bob Marlin.              Bob writes, "I couldn't be happier..."              It's easy to see why. Six months ago, he had never tried to do what I was about to show him. Since then, he's not only done it &amp;mdash; he's used it to lock in a fat 327% gain.              Bruce Buker just did this to lock in a 193% gain in 42 days... Doug Weissel says he's up 250%, "...better than any other gain in 20 years of trading"... and Charlie Lentz just told me he did this and clocked in with two gains, of 149.8% and 198.3% respectively.              But here's my favorite recent story...              #1 Ranked Career Stockbroker Writes         "Dan . . . Sweet Play! I Just Made $200K . . ."              Will Roseman is no rookie.              He got into professional trading back in 1982.              And spent the next 17 years working for one of the world's biggest international investment firms. For five years after that, he worked as a retail broker.              At one point, a rating service ranked Will as one of the top 10 producing brokers in the world, out of a pool of 15,000. He was ranked #1 on the NYSE, too.              And for the last 10 years, he's run his own capital management firm.              So Will knows markets and how to play them.              So you can guess why I was so pleased to get a letter from him just recently that said, doing something he'd read about first in my market research, he hit the cover of the ball... with a $200,000 gain on a single market move.              And again without putting a single dime into stocks.              Is it complicated? Not at all.              It's laughably simple. And I'm about to show you how.              Just realize that you only have until Tuesday, Oct. 28 at 11 A.M. to make the best of this opportunity. After that, you stand to be "shut out" of this... in a very dramatic way.              I'll explain in just a moment.              But first, let's get on with revealing this rare opportunity and how it's working for so many individuals in the markets right now...              A "Hidden" Government Document That         Lets You Gain on Crashing Stocks . . .              You see, at least 58 times a year, the U.S. government quietly issues documents that can reveal to you...              Which stocks are about to go up... which are about to crash... and which you can use to make a fortune.              As much as 400% over the weeks ahead.              How?              They're just people like you and me, doing this.              Some are retired. Others are still working.                       And what they've all discovered is a surprising way to use what I call "100-F documents"... a set of government-mandated reports that could have told you in advance that Wall Street's latest "time bomb" stocks were about to blow apart.              But this is much bigger than just avoiding losses.              Because what I'll show you is that by getting a better idea of what the next round of stocks will be to go down, you can use a very simple strategy to turn those falling shares into gains that go nowhere but up.              How high? You'll see in just a second how many more individuals just like you report using this secret I'll share with you to make fortunes.              Surprisingly fast. Even as stocks crash. And not just once but over and over again.                                Dan Yarford, a 32-year old young father, says, "I just sold for... a total gain of $21,980! This is very exciting stuff... keep 'em coming. Awesome trade!" Dan's total haul, using this "crash insurance" strategy? So far a 491% gain. Dan adds, "I also have an open position that's currently up $11,840..."                                        Bradford Becker writes, "I just sold 1/3rd of my holdings... for a 228% return. I sold the remaining 2/3rds [one month later] for a net return of 444%... so in only two months, my total return was 372%. Great call!"                                        I love what David Meer wrote in to say, "Dan... I haven't added it all up, but my total profits are well over $15,000... perhaps even $20,000. Heck of a nice return..."                                        Herb Hiltman wrote to say he just made 93%. John Scarfield wrote in to say he had just clocked in with a 226% gain. And Barry Halperin wrote to say that just by doing this he made 87% in 30 days... then another 157% in 30 more days... and a hefty 442% gain doing this during one of the big market busts of last summer.                                        Kevin Bruen took in a fast 42%, using this "crash insurance" approach... then turned right around and made another 225% gain just over one month later.                                  Is what they're doing illegal?              Nope. The U.S. government backs it 100%.              In fact, we're not the only people doing this. Those who know are making a bundle.              Even as crashing stocks wipe out millions of other investors.              For instance...                       Two days after seeing the government "100-F document" filed on Oct. 24, 2007...52-year-old David O'Connor was able to use what he knew to sock away $41,891                                        On Feb. 21, 2008, a certain "100-F document" was filed in Washington. Five trading days later, 47-year-old Gerald Lavine pocketed profits of $51,783                                        Roger Barnes of Colorado got more than a glimpse of the "100-F document" filed on Oct. 31, 2007. Six trading days later, he locked in a stunning $237,000 gain.                                  And the surprising truth is anyone can do this.              I lead a small group of individuals who are proving this right now. And I'm about to invite you to join us.              Specifically, I'm going to ask your permission to show you how we're using what we discover both in and around these "100-F Documents" to pile up one winning market move after another.              But as I said... you must act on this quickly, before the Tuesday, Oct. 28th deadline &amp;mdash; at 11 A.M. that morning &amp;mdash; if you want to make the most of this situation.              At the very least, I like to think of it like the way you'd imagine collecting insurance after a natural disaster.              Because you can use this approach best right at the moment calamity is decimating most investments.              The situation we're looking at right now is exactly one of those moments. And "retirement recovery" is definitely what we're after, using this strategy.              In fact, this strategy is working so well &amp;mdash; better than we'd even hoped &amp;mdash; a lot of the people I've shown this to write back to say they're using this not just to rebuild their portfolios, but to get very rich.              Take Bruce Bedford, who just wrote me to say, "Dan, I sold my position today at $14...up 194% from $4.75 in 42 days...I'm delighted with the outcome...More, please!"              Or Wallace Kirk...
