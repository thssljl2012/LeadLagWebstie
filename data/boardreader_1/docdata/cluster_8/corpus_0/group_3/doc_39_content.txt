While making the rounds in the Finovate networking room last week, I saw an intriguing graphic on Yodlee's big-screen monitor (see inset). It turns out to be Qi (pronounced "key"), the robot mascot for Yodlee's latest aggregation client, Australia's ANZ Bank, which launched that day (press release). The new service is called MoneyManager (see screenshot below; note 1).  The cute little beast also appears in the bank's new iPhone promo on the ANZ website (here). The webpage features the app running in a full-size iPhone emulator. But that's not what you notice first. The bank uses a little programming trick to turn your curser into a GIANT robot hand (see screenshot below). It's a little disconcerting at first, but it does get your attention and proves you are dealing with a creative enterprise. I like it.  According to Rob Findley, blogging at The Bank Channel, MoneyManager can be used by any Australian and does NOT require an ANZ account relationship.
