 Vocation Speaking of long lines, Bank of America who has bought out Countrywide, the nation's leading mortgage company, has also bought out Merrill Lynch. Hmm...can anyone else see that they will soon be in the line for government backing? What happened to the so-called stop on monopolies in the marketplace?My questions to you are this - I hear stories for both sides of the Fed bailout and have my own opinions on the matter as well, but one thing I have not heard was what would happen if the government did NOT bail out Fannie and Freddie. These two conglomerates hold more than $5 Trillion dollars in mortgages. It is not the fault of the average American homeowner out there that the management of these companies was incompetent.What happens if the government does not bail out AIG and the others on the block now? I am not saying that the government should be held responsible for the mismanagement of some of these companies, but what about the big picture?I definitely agree with a cap being put on what any CEO, especially of a failing institution, can receive. Frankly, they should have to pay back what they took!! But, that's a whole other story.I do not agree that the taxpayer's should have to pay for it either, but what else can be done?? If these companies close on top of an already increasing unemployment rate and a less than blissful economy, what happens then.Similar posts:  health care employment
