I'm not usually one for political posts, but the juxtaposition of the appearance of an article by John McCain (probably written months ago, but just now published) with recent events is just too amazing to pass up.  (I learned about this via NY Times Columnist Paul Krugman, but double checked a few things myself.)John McCain describes his health care plan in an article published in the Sept./Oct. issue of Contingencies, the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries.  ("Better Care at Lower Cost for Every American", available at http://www.contingencies.org/septoct08/mccain.pdf)In this article, he says "Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation."In other words, McCain wants to do for health care what deregulation has done for banking.
