Hey everyone, i have a question for ya. I was talking to staticfox about donations for our big FC party, and an interesting question came up. How would you like us to handle the donated money? i made a little poll to see what you guys think :) View Poll: How to handle money donationsI totally understand any hesitations with the first option. I only suggested it cause i LIVE in the bay area, and am only 30 minutes from the FC hotel. So it would be easy for me to keep it safe. i can open up a special savings account at bank of america for safe keeping, then close out the account right before FC starts. But again, this is only one of the options :)my worry with the second option is, Cons are always so hectic. It may be hard for some people to find either of us if they want to be generous enough to donate money to the party for booze and such. Both of us DO have cellphones, so that's always an option too, is to just call us when you want to give us the money or something. *shrugs*anyway, Comments are greatly appreciated!
