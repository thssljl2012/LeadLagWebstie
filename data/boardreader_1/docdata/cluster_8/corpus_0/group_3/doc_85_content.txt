There are some commercials that really bother me, and I'm not even talking about political ads.  Those are a whole other category of irritating.1.  What is with those Charles Schwab commercials with the semi-real, but still animated people?  It just looks weird.  I don't like it at all.  At least the talking isn't annoying and is just the stuff that makes me go, "blah, blah."2.  I think that Nationwide car insurance is so stupid.   It's like she's on a game show, but she's doing the review to get custom car insurance.  Then she acts so excited that she got something . . . for which she has to pay!3. There's a diabetic meter commercial.  It drives me crazy because the guy cannot say "accuracy."  He says, "ac - cra - see."  I don't know what that is.4.  Then, I think Wilford Brimley and his "diabeetus" disturbs everybody.  I don't know why he can suddenly change it to say diabetes when he says "the American Diabetes Association," but he does, and then it goes right back to "diabeetus."
