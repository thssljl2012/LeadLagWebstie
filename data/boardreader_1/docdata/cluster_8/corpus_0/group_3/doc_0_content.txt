I heard a great idea today...................since none of our leaders are making us feel any better about the economic situation......or even really explaining it............Sarah Vowell said that instead of reading the NY Times everyday.......she goes online and listens to...............FDR's Fireside Chats.........amazingly enough......the first Fireside Chat entitled.....&amp;quot;On The Bank Crisis&amp;quot;...from Sunday, March 12, 1933.....actually does a fine job of explaining our situation right now!!!!!!!&amp;nbsp; At least he explains it better than our freakin' President did.....or any freakin' Senator did!!!!!!&amp;nbsp; They didn't even have the respect for us to even TRY to explain it!!!Take a listen.......it actually DOES&amp;nbsp;make you feel better!!!!!!!!You can Listen To Them Here.............http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/medialist.php?presid=32Or you can Read&amp;nbsp;Them Here.......http://www.mhric.org/fdr/fdr.htmlFYI....these transcripts are more complete.&amp;nbsp;And you really might want to have a listen/read after I tell you this.......Today, The Federal Reserve has agreed to provide another $38 billion in loans to insurance giant AIG on top of the $85 billion loan already promised.&amp;nbsp; The announcement follows harsh criticism from lawmakers after an AIG subsidiary spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a retreat days after the first $85 billion in federal funds were promised. As I have said right here...in very this Blog.........this is how The Bail Out will REALLY be implemented.&amp;nbsp; So for now ....I am going to go listen to a FireSide Chat myself.....and pretend that it is 1933......yes....we will still have a horrible war to live through.....But at least, for just a short while................I'll have the comfort of knowing...........how it turns out.And that we made it through the tragic mess.Peace.Okay....Sarah Silverman (be warned!) WILL get Obama elected in Florida.....or she won't visit her Bubbe.....and neither will you!!!.......http://www.thegreatschlep.com/site/index.htmlBarack&amp;nbsp;Hussein Obama and Manischewitz&amp;nbsp;Guberman!!!&amp;nbsp; Hilarious!!!...but this is out there!!!My name is Lori Gum and I do not, necessarily, endorse this message!!Peace.One last thing.....today McCain referred to, &amp;quot;My Fellow Prisoners&amp;quot;.....you gotta really scratch your head (or poke something out) at this comment....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4FADXTI-vcWhat the fuck?&amp;nbsp; Just a slip of tongue?&amp;nbsp; A Freudian slip? What the hell? No matter what it is.I'm worried.I'm gonna go listen to FDR.....again.And maybe...............again.
