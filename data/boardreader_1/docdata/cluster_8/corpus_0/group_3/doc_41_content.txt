So... for those of you who don't know.... here's an update.I'm -still- not working, almost two months after my car accident.&amp;nbsp; No, I'm not in horrible agony, no, I'm not relegated to the bed or the recliner like I&amp;nbsp;was in the beginning.&amp;nbsp; But my lifting limitations, and my bending/twisting limitations, are all too restrictive to allow me to return yet.&amp;nbsp; I'm not really all that happy about it.So, I&amp;nbsp;have Lost Wages coverage.&amp;nbsp; Progressive, my insurance, is covering 60%, AIG, the other guy's insurance, is covering 40%.&amp;nbsp; The issue now is that AIG&amp;nbsp;went under and is being bought out by the government/private investors, so.... I&amp;nbsp;have seen nothing from them, and haven't been able to contact them in 3 weeks now.&amp;nbsp; This is bad.&amp;nbsp; The person I&amp;nbsp;was able to reach wasn't able to help me, but did say that they're still processing claims, so hopefully it's just a matter of &amp;quot;when&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;and not &amp;quot;if&amp;quot;.Add to that, I&amp;nbsp;have that coverage on my car loan that pays your car payment if you are out of work on disability.&amp;nbsp; Except, apparently the bank screwed up and assigned that coverage to my husband instead of to me, and since we signed the papers, we're screwed.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;-just- found this out last week.&amp;nbsp; So yeah.....I&amp;nbsp;won't be going to ICC.
