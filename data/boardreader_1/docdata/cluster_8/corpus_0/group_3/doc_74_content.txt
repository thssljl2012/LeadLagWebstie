&amp;#8230;Thanks to Capitalism Magazine for this article. The contents of this article are chilling about the recent government takeover of the nation&amp;#8217;s nine largest banks. The government takeover of ANYTHING is unacceptable. How to instill communism in America? Not in a Bulshevik revolution (Sorry, Lenin, we&amp;#8217;re too smart for that) but in a PROGRESSIVE benevolent takeover (Sorry, America, are we too stupid to recognize this truth?). The front page of today&amp;#8217;s Wall Street Journal carries a story titled &amp;#8220;At Moment of Truth, U.S. Forced Big Bankers to Blink.&amp;#8221; In the quarter-century I&amp;#8217;ve been reading the Journal, I&amp;#8217;ve never read a news story that was more disturbing. The article describes the Monday, October 13 meeting between government regulators and top executives from nine of the nation&amp;#8217;s largest banks. &amp;#8220;On one side of the table sat Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, flanked by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Benanke and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair. &amp;#8220;On the other side sat the nation&amp;#8217;s top bank executives, who had flown in from around the country, lined up in alphabetical order by bank, with Bank of America Corp. at one end of the table and Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co. at another.&amp;#8221; The government officials most responsible for causing the financial crisis ordered the bankers to appear at this meeting, with no explanation of the purpose of the meeting. &amp;#8230; Missing from this meeting was someone willing to play the role of Dagny Taggart, Ayn Rand&amp;#8217;s heroine in Atlas Shrugged, who saw government incompetence, corruption, and moral bankruptcy all around her and vowed not to join other businesses in capitulating to it. Like Mr. Kovacevich, she would have challenged the need for another government bailout. More than that, she would have challenged the bureaucrats&amp;#8217; right to call such a meeting, to make such demands, and most especially to claim the moral high ground by claiming to speak on behalf of the &amp;#8220;good of the country.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;My &amp;#8216;term sheet&amp;#8217; is the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution,&amp;#8221; Dagny Taggart might have said by way of a conclusion. &amp;#8220;If you really want to solve this financial crisis, and not just expand your budgets and power, you have to do just one thing: Get the hell out of my way.&amp;#8221; &amp;lt;read more&amp;gt;
