This may be controversial thinking, but maybe Citibank is not so wrong after all?  Face it, the banking business is not what it used to be, and the Feds have been breathing down Citibank's neck for months -- "Spin off your non-bank businesses!"  "Lend more money!"  Plus also, the writing is on the wall, executive compensation-wise, and if the huddled masses keep up with their whining it'll be impossible for a bank exec to make enough millions to support the lifestyle to which he is accustomed.  So why not start buying some private jets?  Surely that's one asset that won't depreciate as quickly as, say, Citibank stock?  The whole banking thing was fun while it lasted, sure.  But come on!  Private jets!  Fun!  Maybe they can buy a dumptruck and a fire engine too!
