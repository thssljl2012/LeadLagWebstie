Two positives today in the quest to allow bankruptcy judges to enforce modification of home mortgages: Citibank came out in favor of the change. This seems monumental since it&amp;#8217;s been the bankers who have crushed earlier attempts to repeal this safe haven for mortgage lenders. The second was Obama&amp;#8217;s call to move the stimulus bill quickly. I&amp;#8217;ve read the bill and am planning on how to use it when it becomes available. Upon enactment, it will apply to cases already on file.
