So Citibank goes on a shopping spree with your money --  ooo la la-- this from Boortz:"Citibank just received how much in bailout money? $45 billion? And now they go out and buy a $45 million private jet? Yup, makes perfect sense to me. Oh ... they bought the jet from France. They took our taxpayer dollars and stimulated the French economy. Nice."
