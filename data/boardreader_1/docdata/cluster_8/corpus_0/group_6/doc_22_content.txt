There&#8217;s FAIL and then there&#8217;s OMGWTFAIL, if you know what I mean. Chrysler decided that several hundred thousand dollars of taxpayer money would be well-spent publishingthis in several major papers:  &#8230;Sadly, I don&#8217;t have a bigger picture, but you get the point.  Apparently they figured that the majority of Americans who strongly disagreed with the decision to bail out the car companies would appreciate having their noses rubbed in it via a public waste of a bunch of the money.  Brilliant. They also put it up in a blog post, which got some awesome responses before they took it down.  You can still read them here, if you&#8217;ve a taste for vitriol today. For my part, I&#8217;m a lot angrier about the bank bailouts than the car-company ones.   The banks took twenty times the money, ostensibly to &#8220;save the economy&#8221;, then refused to account for any of it.  Their concerns were executives and investors, rather than working people (not that the auto co&#8217;s are making much of an effort to preserve jobs either); and their atrocities with the spending have been at least as bad &#8212; I know I&#8217;m thrilled to have helped pay for Bank of America to swallow yet another company. But all this, all of it, goes to show one thing:  No matter what wealthy, lobbyist-bought politicians want us to believe, you CANNOT give money to the rich and &#8220;trust&#8221; that they&#8217;ll spend it in the best interests of everyone. Really, if America just learns that from this whole fiasco, I&#8217;ll be happy.   Originally published at *Transcendental *Logic. You can comment here or there.
