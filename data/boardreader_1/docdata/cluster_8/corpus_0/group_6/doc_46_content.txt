A friend of mine has a brother who is a banker.  His first rule of banking was that if there is a line where someone is handing out money, you get in line.  Thain just found a line and somehow was allowed to keep returning to the front for another handout.  Finally, finally, someone kicked him out of line.  He is probably applying for unemployment just now.  After all, he had a million dollar office that he 'may' not be able to take with him.  Barney Frank should tighten the rules so that nobody in these banks, not just the top executives, is allowed to get bonuses.  Thain siphoned out $4 billion dollars from Lynch during the sale of his company to B of A to pay for his executives immediately before the bonuses would have been vetoed.  How do you spell Quid pro quo?  That is an old English saying meaning one quid for you, one quid for me.
