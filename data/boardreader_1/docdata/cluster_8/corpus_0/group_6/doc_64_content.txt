Bloomberg.com: News Obama promised a new era of government openness as he took office last week, issuing a statement telling agencies to adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure in responding to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers, head of the National Economic Council, said they would emphasize accountability and transparency in using the second half of a $700 billion bank bailout fund. Late yesterday, Geithners office put hundreds of pages about the fund on the departments Web site. They did not include documents describing the guaranteed assets. Congress Rebuffed Members of Congress from both parties have complained about the Bush administrations lack of disclosure about the spending of the first $350 billion from the fund.  And&#8230; Bloomberg News asked the Treasury Department Jan. 26 to disclose what securities it backed over the past two months in a second round of actions to prop up Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. Department spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said Jan. 27 she would seek an answer. None had been provided by the close of business yesterday.  How long do you think it will take Obama to reach Bush&#8217;s popularity levels?  He&#8217;s certainly acting like Bush in a lot of ways.   Tweet This
