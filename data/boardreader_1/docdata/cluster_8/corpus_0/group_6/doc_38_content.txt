I posted awhile back about the head of GM complaining that he could no longer "get a decent hotel" and that he had to stand in line at the airline counter instead of flying via corporate jet.  In my post, I argued that he was so out of touch with reality and questioned how he could understand his customers' needs if he thought flying business class on Northwest and staying at a 3-star hotel was beneath him.Yesterday, I heard another doozie.  Apparently, the head of Merril Lynch pushed through some bonuses for a few of his colleagues just before the takeover by Bank of America.  He also spent 1.2 million dollars renovating his office last year.1.2 million dollars.  The guy spent 1.2 million dollars of the company's money on ONE ROOM.  The majority of American citizens are lucky to have an entire home that's worth a quarter of that or less.  And we wonder why these firms are going under?  How can anyone seriously justify over a million dollars to decorate one room in an office building?Makes me wonder what we spend on the Oval office.  According to NPR, every new U.S. president gets to choose a new rug when they renovate the Oval office.  When that president leaves and a new one re-decorates, the old rug is put into storage because "it's technically government property".  How many oval rugs to we have sitting in a warehouse somewhere and do I want to know what they cost?  Please tell me we at least donate them to the Smithsonian or something.
