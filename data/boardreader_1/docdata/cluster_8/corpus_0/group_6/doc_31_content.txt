By Eric Bolling Co-Host, &#8220;Happy Hour&#8221;, FOX Business Network/Host, &#8220;The Strategy Room&#8221; Foxnews.com This week, one of Wall Street&#8217;s high profile CEOs was shown the exit. Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis gave Merrill Lynch boss John Thain his marching orders. Thain was fired because of massive amounts of toxic assets on the Merrill books that may or may not have been evident during the shotgun marriage between the Banker and Broker last September. Recall, on the very weekend Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy under the weight of its own ponzi-like business model, Merrill leapt into the open arms of B of A in an attempt to save itself from the same fate. Mr. Lewis bought a lemon. It wasn&#8217;t until this week, that we all could see just how awful the lemonade they were drinking at B of A and Merrill really was. And then there&#8217;s the outrage is that the lemonade was sweetened with OUR TAX DOLLARS!! Besides fessing up to allegedly $15 billion of toxic assets on Merrill&#8217;s books, we hear that Mr. Thain was really busy these last few months. It&#8217;s not that he was busy working to remove the garbage assets off Merrill&#8217;s balance sheet or motivating the powerful 16,000 broker network to step up and bring Merrill back from the abyss. No, Thain was busy redecorating his office to the tune of $1.2 million! I am not sure what ticks me off more&#8230;three geniuses flying to Washington for a handout in three separate private jets or this jerk spending taxpayer money (after all money is fungible- if you borrow money from me and put it in your left pocket and spend money out of your right pocket, you still spent MY money). I think these Wall Street morons should be sent to a place where you get three squares and an hour of yard per day. It might give them a chance to realize that hard working, taxpaying, business owning people are paying for these utterly ridiculous extravagancies. What makes this story so extremely gross is that they spent our money as our unemployment rate is soaring. So what that means is,  that while millions of Americans are finding the unemployment office for the first time and dealing with the struggle of feeding their families, this arrogant S.O.B is spending taxpayer money like this: -Fabric for a Roman Shade $11,000 -Area Rug $87,000 -Curtains $28,000 -Pair of Guest Chairs $87,000 And hey, how about the $230,000 driver&#8230;just the driver, not the car. And did you notice the $13,000 we spent for the chandelier in the private dining room? Uuuh, Mr. Thain did you really need a private dining room IN YOUR OFFICE? And the fat cats in New York and elsewhere wonder why America is outraged with Wall Street. As a guy who spent 22 years there, before coming to FOX, I am extremely and truly embarrassed by my fellow traders, brokers and bankers.
