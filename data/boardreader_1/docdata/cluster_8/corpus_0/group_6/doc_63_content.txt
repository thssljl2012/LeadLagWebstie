I am no Citibank, but I am standing in line for my chunk of the federal pie.I came home last night to discover my W-2 in the mail. Now, I have plenty to do. Little things. Like learning Spanish or sorting items for the drive south.Instead, I sat down at the computer, updated TurboTax, and started transferring data. My intention was to enter my W-2, and get on with the rest of the evening.But I simply kept going. Twenty minutes later, my federal and state taxes were filed. Now I need only wait for the great refund machine to kick into gear, and I should have the equivalent of a GM loan (or at least a splinter) in my hand before the month ends.I find it difficult to remember when I had to wait until the end of the month to receive my W-2 forms. Then I would dig up my receipts, and spend several nights on a Bataan death march through the tax forms.The combination of keeping my financial records in Quicken and using online fling has greatly simplified the process -- and I am positive that the result is far more accurate. The exercise was very reassuring because I now know I can do the whole process from Mexico next year.  (OK. Now, I sound like the back of a software box. But I say give credit where credit is due.)Last year at the end of January, I was celebrating the deposit of my federal refund in tax and spend. One year on, and I intend to be celebrating at about the same time.I wonder if I can stretch my birthweek celebration into a birthmonth fte?
