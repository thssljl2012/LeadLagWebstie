OK, Egg have really annoyed me today, and their savings account is less than 2% now (not really surprising I know). Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone has any experience of ING Direct or Nationwide. ING Direct have a really good savings account right now - instant (internet only) access and 5% interest (for the first year). We currently have quite a bit of savings, so I'm thinking its worth the effort to switch (it will mostly go to pay for Japan!). Nationwide don't charge for using their credit card abroad, so I'm thinking of getting one for Japan. Japan is a mostly cash-only culture, but it won't hurt to have a CC that won't charge us.In the current climate I'm a bit hesitant to go applying for things/moving money though.Oh, and we still need travel insurance for Japan, but they all charge loads due to the diabetes. Someone recommended one to me but I forgot who it was. Any recommendations?
