             I always work on the nights I have a good day trading the markets.I bought two S&amp;P 500 futures contracts this morning at 806. For my non-trader friends, that means I make $100 for every point the S&amp;P 500 climbs. Those contracts are now trading at 837.50 So I made $3150 sitting at my computer today for a few hours.This is an example of leveraging the I quadrant. There isn't a job in the world that will pay me $3k a day to sit at my computer, flip between www.slopeofhope.com, www.stripperweb.com, www.exoticdancernet.com, and sip my coffee. A great day like this doesn't happen often. I do love my Wednesdays though, I don't have to teach a fitness class in the morning, so I can sleep in and catch up on the markets.I took advice from www.slopeofhope.com and went long oil via OIH, XLE, DIG and DXO, and Agriculture via DBA to play the weakness in the Euro vs the Dollar. I also played a tip from Curtis the other night in the VIP room, he said to go long Bank of America. Then today the stock soars at the CEO buys 200k shares. I'm in. I also went long on financials by buying calls on IYF and puts on SKF.What does this have to do with stripping?Nothing!Your job does not define who you are.
