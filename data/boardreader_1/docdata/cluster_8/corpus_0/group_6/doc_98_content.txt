Any bonus over $50,000 at BAC 's investment banking staff will be paid in three annual installments in starting in 2010.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/51df9ac6-ecb5-11dd-a534-0000779fd2ac.htmlMaybe these overpaid bankers can get Wall Street to securitize their bonus in a special pool with TALF funding! I'm sure Bernanke would approve!For more on the TALF:http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/monetary20081125a1.pdfAt least BofA is a quick learner. Look what Obama had to say about these "shameful" Wall Street bonuses:The American people understand that weve got a big hole that weve got to dig  ourselves out of, but they dont like the idea that people are digging a bigger  hole even as theyre being asked to fill it up, Mr. Obama said, adding that  there will be time for them to make profits and there will be time for them to  make bonuses. Now is not that time.http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/business/30obama.html?_r=2&amp;hp
