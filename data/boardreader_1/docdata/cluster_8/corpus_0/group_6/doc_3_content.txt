The financial crisis and other things is causing major drama over there in Latvia.  Weren't they part of the friends of Bush coalition during the Iraq war support shout-out?  An Internet buddy of mine that posts on You Tube pointed out last week that no one is discussing what is happening in Iceland (Bjork's pixie homeland); those people have been losing their shit for months now.  My buddy says that it isn't being covered in the UK, where he lives, which is odd since the British have lost a lot of money there. Side Note:Walmart is moving into the check cashing business?  Citibank must be about to lose their shit because years ago it was revealed that underneath a bunch of shell companies they were the largest owners of check cashing scam operations in the country.  Citibank is on their knees right now financially so I guess Walmart figured why not finish them off.  Banks have no one to blame but themselves, their excessive use of fees to generate money on the backs of consumers will result in folks seeing Walmarts $3.00 fee cap as a viable alternative to regular banking.
