December 30, 2008, my son showed me his Citibank card which was close to breaking in two along the magnetic strip. We were in the mall then. The strip could still be read but rather than wait for such time when it would be unusable, I called Citibank (9959999)&amp;#8217;s trunk line. An officer immediately took my call and said she would process the request for a replacement card. What do you know? January 1, we received the card. Except for that time when Citibank had problems about the telephone PIN of the Rustan&amp;#8217;s credit card, it hasn&amp;#8217;t given me any problems at all. Hooray for Citibank. It was up and about even during the long holidays!
