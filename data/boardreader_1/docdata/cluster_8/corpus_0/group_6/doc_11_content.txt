     You probably should.  Credit card issuers have been raising interest rates on their customers without giving any reason. They've also been slicing cardholders' credit limits. On what grounds? In many cases, their practices are completely opaque.  Teresa Dixon Murray of the Cleveland Plain Dealer writes:  In fact, numerous credit card companies are raising their rates because they fear defaults will increase, even among good customers, if the economy continues to sour. The increased interest rate helps them hedge their mounting risk for the future.  Some credit card companies have raised interest rates on certain customers by over 100%! One of&#0160;the worst offenders is Bank of America:  What's striking is how arbitrary the Bank of America rate increases appear, credit industry experts say. In recent years, many card companies have turned to a practice called "risk-based pricing," where they will raise a regular paying consumer's rate because of a decline in the person's FICO score. FICO is a credit-risk score developed by Fair Isaac (FIC) that includes a number of risk metrics the Minneapolis company doesn't disclose. Credit reporting bureaus supply creditors with FICO scores along with other data, such as late payments and debts owed.  In a December congressional hearing spearheaded by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), lawmakers slammed big card companies for using such pricing with customers who pay on time. By law, credit-card lenders can change terms as long as they notify borrowers. Even so, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) announced ahead of Levin's hearing that they would stop the practice of raising card rates based solely on FICO scores.  But Bank of America appears to be taking an even more aggressive stance because, beyond credit scores, it is using internal criteria that aren't available to consumers. That makes the reason for the rate increase even more opaque. "Congress has faulted credit-card companies for lack of transparency in raising rates," says William Ryan, a financial industry analyst at Portales Partners, a New York-based research firm. "Bank of America is bringing it to a new level."&#0160;&#0160; Additionally, some credit card companies are slashing&#0160;available credit, sometimes to the amount owed on the card. This affects your credit rating, even though you may have done nothing wrong:  Doing this, in turn, can increase the rates on your other cards as you are a higher risk borrower when youe axed out?a credit card. And again, you don have to have done anything rong?for your credit card company to lower your available credit. For example, use your card at a store where others who also shop there have a history of bad credit, and you can see your own credit suffer because youe now in that isk pool.?AARP the Magazine reported in early December on Jesse Gilleland, who pays his bills on time but recently had his credit limit dropped by American Express. The reason? he letter cited AmEx experiences with other consumers who shop at places where Gilleland recently used his card and with customers who had home loans with his mortgage provider.?American Express would not identify for AARP hich merchants or mortgage providers raise red flags for the company.?/span&gt; I can't find the link, but on a recent show, Randi Rhodes stated that her credit card max had been lowered, and that this affected her credit rating--where she'd had credit card debt of, say, 25% of her limit, once the limit was lowered, her current debt represented 50% of the limit, so her credit rating went down.  New rules for credit card issuers are scheduled, but not until July of 2010. These would, among other things, prevent issuers from raising rates on existing debt in most cases, improve transparency in lending practices, and ban the practice of "universal default," whereby consumers may have fallen behind in payments to other creditors, though not to the issuer in question.  Some Democratic lawmakers plan to introduce legislation to implement these rules and others much sooner than the schedule devised by the Federal Reserve Board. Naturally, the credit card companies are howling that they can't possibly make these changes within 90 days.  But they sure can expect you, the consumer, to suck it up tomorrow,&#0160;even&#0160;as they cut off your credit and leave you high and dry.            ...
