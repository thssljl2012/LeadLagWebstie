Let's face reality. Georgia needs a federal bailout. The Peach State is in worse shape than Chrysler and Bank of America put together. President Obama's stimulus package has earmarked about $5.6 billion to help Georgia.  That is not nearly enough. We need some serious money. President Bush approved almost a trillion dollars to rescue Wall Street banks with few strings attached. One bank installed a new executive bathroom with part of the money; others bought out less-fortunate banks. You and I were left holding the IOUs.  Georgia's list of needs stretches from highways to water conservation to schools to health care and so forth. You name it, Georgia needs it. Mostly we need to stem the rise of unemployment and reverse the real estate foreclosure rate. We need to return to prosperity road.  Of course, several Republicans in our congressional delegation are dead-set against the stimulus package. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Savannah, warns that the Washington bailout is 'left-leaning' and includes aid for too many social programs.  Many Georgia congressmen opposing the help are key members of the National Crackpot Caucus. It is understandable that they would be against the stimulus. They want to protect their caucus positions and reassure their anti-communist base back home. Never mind that Georgia is rapidly turning into Mississippi East, and that communism no longer is a problem except in New Haven, Conn.  Not to worry, though. Help may be on the way at last. In the recent election, Barack Obama came within 5 points of winning Georgia as he took a hefty chunk of white votes. Our population continues to grow with younger and better-educated people, many of them brown and black.  Even more encouraging is the number of potential star politicians emerging from the guano piles in the Georgia House and Senate. Here's a who's-who sample of comers that is by no means complete:
