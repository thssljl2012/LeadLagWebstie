A warning to big-spending Wall Street executives: Obama is watching you.  The nation's chief executive took aim at corporate executives who have flouted lavish lifestyles even as the government props up their companies with billions of dollars in taxpayer money. 'It is shameful,' President Obama told reporters after a meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Vice President Joe Biden Thursday, noting that he read an unspecified article indicating that Wall Street bankers had recently paid themselves $20 billion in bonuses, about the same amount they paid themselves in 2004, when the economy was running near full steam.   The president exaggerated only slightly. According to an article in The New York Times Thursday, Wall Streeters received $18.4 billion in bonuses in 2008, roughly what they received four years ago, and the sixth-biggest bonus payout in history.  Obama, in a rare display of agitation, also took a swipe at executive largess at Citigroup   Citi isn't the only group taking both bailout money and heat for the actions of its executives.

TARP recipients must agree to limits on executive compensation, though those limits have become more rigid as more money has been doled out. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., has sponsored a measure that could make the most strict executive compensation limits retroactive for those who received TARP money months ago.   Obama's remarks on fiscal restraint come just a day after the House of Representatives passed a fiscal stimulus plan worth $819 billion, one of the largest acts of government spending in the nation's history. Not a single Republican voted in favor of the stimulus. Next week, the Senate takes up a slightly different version of the bill.
