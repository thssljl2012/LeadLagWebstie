CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- If you were slapped with an overdraft fee from Bank of America you could get some extra cash. The bank recently settled a lawsuit claiming it charged millions in bogus fees.   Bank of America's class-action lawsuit settled for $35 million. The Charlotte based bank is accused of changing the order of some customers transactions resulting in overdraft fees. The bank denies any wrongdoing, however they're agreeing to pay up to $78 per account holder.   In order to receive the money from the bank, you must have been a Bank of America account holder between December 6, 2000 and December 31, 2007. During that time you must have been charged an insufficient funds fee, overdraft fee or similar fee. You must also have had access to your account through a debit or other bank card.   Then you need to fill out a form thats available online. It asks basic questions like your name and address and when your account was active. The form asks for your bank account number, but you can give your home address instead.   Submit the form online or mail it through the post office. The deadline to file a claim is May 1.
