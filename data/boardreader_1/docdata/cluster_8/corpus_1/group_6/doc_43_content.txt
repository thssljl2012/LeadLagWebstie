The House Republican Leader and his No. 2, Whip Eric Cantor, told their rank-and-file members Tuesday morning during a closed-door meeting to oppose the bill when it comes to the floor Wednesday, according to an aide familiar with the discussion.  This should dampen the mood for an early afternoon meeting with the president, who is making the trek to hear Republicans input on the legislation before Wednesday's vote.  The action that should really be taken is to make CitiBank return its taxpayer bailout money because it used taxpayer money to buy a very luxurious 10-passenger jet for its corporate use. Buying one luxurious jet is not a stimulus to the economy, but it is an example of the private (for profit, greed, and me-first) sector philosophies. The money wasted on the rich could certainly be better used by the needy paying for necessities of life.  - Gary L. Kerr, Chichester  Once again, Tom's ignorance shines through. I don't think he'll ever understand why the repukes lost the last two elections. Being an obstructionist to the new president is not the pathway out of the minority. Tom, I sure hope your job is secure, pal, because the party in power isn't going to help you.  - Frank, Manchester  To think just yesterday Pelosi's fix for the economy was birth control. Who voted for these idiots?!  - Joe H, Manchester  This is exactly what the GOP should do - put up a principled opposition to this uberpig, put forward an alternative plan, and vote against it without filibustering. Obama has the votes to get it through, but the Republicans would be foolish to cooperate with his CYA 'bipartisanship'. The Obamacrats will be responsible for the cost of the bill and the failure of the bill to stimulate the economy.  - Tom, Campton  NOTE: If you have visited this page before, newer comments may be hidden.
