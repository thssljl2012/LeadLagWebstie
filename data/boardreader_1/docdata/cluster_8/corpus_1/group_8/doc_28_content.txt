Expressing confidence in the new Obama government, Indian IT representative body Nasscom on Tuesday said it does not expect the recent protectionist measures taken by the US government to have any impact on the Indian IT-BPO industry.  Having met with various stakeholders and experts and discussed the protectionist measures, Nasscom does not see the discussion on removal of tax breaks for US companies that create jobs offshore provisions in their current forms having any impact on the Indian IT-BPO industry, Nasscom said in a statement. We are confident that US will consider all factors as they have in the stimulus bill and other proposed initiatives for reviving the economy and employment, it added. The Barack Obama administration has imposed restrictions on entities receiving taxpayers money from applying for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, if such immigrants replace American workers.   According to media reports, Bank of America has become the first US bank to withdraw job offers made to MBA students graduating from the US business schools this summer, citing conditions laid out in its bail-out deal as the reason. Bank of America had received a total of $45 billion in Tarp funds.   With the economic meltdown, there are significant concerns regarding the growing unemployment.   Domestic pressure  Nasscom said there is an increase in pressure in the US from local constituents to protect jobs, as unemployment looks to breach the 10 per cent mark. Measures such as closing borders for trade and promoting protectionism presents a serious risk to the world economy today. Nothing should be done which seem attractive and populist in the short term but will have a long term negative impact, Nasscom said. H-1B visa  The body also raised concerns regarding the proposed amendment to the H-1B visa legislation. In its current form, the amendment seems to isolate and unfairly target Indian IT companies and severely restrict the level-playing field.  Contrary to popular belief of Indian companies taking majority of H-1 B visas, the Indian IT industry constitutes only 11 per cent of the total visas issued in 2008, it said.
