IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley is backtracking a bit about his comments suggesting that AIG executives should accept responsibility for the collapse of the insurance giant by resigning or killing themselves.  The Republican lawmaker's comments came Monday during an interview with Cedar Rapids radio station WMT.  In a conference call with Iowa reporters on Tuesday, Grassley said he'd like executives of failed businesses to make a more formal public apology as business leaders have previously done in Japan.  He said he doesn't want people to commit suicide. But he said he feels strongly that there aren't 'statements of apology, statements of remorse, statements of contrition' by CEOs who are asking for bailouts.' Monday's Comments  Grassley suggested Monday that AIG executives should take a Japanese approach toward accepting responsibility for the collapse of the insurance giant by resigning or killing themselves.  The Republican lawmaker's comments echoed remarks he has made in the past about corporate executives and public apologies, but went further in suggesting suicide.  Grassley said AIG executives should follow 'the Japanese example' by publicly apologizing and 'do one of two things: resign or commit suicide.' Grassley spokesman Casey Mills said the senator 'doesn't want U.S. executives to do that,' but said those who accept tax dollars and spend them on travel and bonuses do so irresponsibly.
