Mortgage expert Rodney Anderson explains that mortgage also has be owned or insured by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and it must be a primary residence. He adds that homeowners qualify if they are current on their monthly payments for the past 12 months. 'If that's the case, the government will offer your mortgage company financial incentives to allow you to refinance -- even if you owe a little more than your home is worth.' Here are more tips from Anderson: -- If you are already behind on your payments, the modification part of the plan may be able to help. -- If you have had a big increase in your mortgage payment, a big reduction in your income, or if you have suffered a financial hardship, the government will pay your mortgage servicer to modify the interest or length of your loan to get your monthly payments down to 31 percent of your gross income.

They hope to be able to move forward by April 1. 'I feel that the mortgage services right now are just waiting for the instructions,' Anderson says.
