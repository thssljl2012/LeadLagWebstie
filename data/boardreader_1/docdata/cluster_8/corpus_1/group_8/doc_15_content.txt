I recently observed a photograph in a local newspaper of U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter hugging Vice President Joe Biden, with Sen. Robert Casey Jr. and another unidentified legislator in the background.  It appears the members of the Nationalist Democratic Socialist party were honoring Specter because he voted for the biggest spending bill in history. Un-twistable arm? I think not, senator.  In the late 1990s President Clinton appointed the senators wife to the National Council to the Arts, which in turn acts in an advisory capacity to the National Endowment for the Arts. In the stimulus package there were $50 million allocated for this.  But, of course, the senator did not read the bill, nor did anyone else in the gang of 538 in Washington, D.C. I believe they are a gang, club or whatever else you want to call them; but legislators they are not.  They dont legislate via Constitution, or Citibank would not be taken over by the government and its board of directors picked by the government. Sen. Specter knows this.  And now the card check bill. Un-twistable arm again, yeah right.  The senator voted to confirm new Attorney General Eric Holder, who had pardoned the FALN bombers, and voted to confirm some other tax cheats to the Cabinet.  I would like to know who the senator and the Capitol gang in Washington represent. Since its not our Constitution or the taxpayer, it must be themselves.  If the senators arm was any more un-twistable, he could go on the road as a contortionist show.  So, senator, come next election, I and I hope thousands of others intend to fire you, since we dont work for you, I believe you work for us.  Thats true, isnt it, senator?
