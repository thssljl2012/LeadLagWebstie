AIG, the worlds largest insurance company of which we  US taxpayers  now own 80 percent, has consumed nearly $170 billion in our dollars to bail out bad bets it made selling credit insurance to banks and investment houses.  Now we know where the money went  largely to other Wall Street banks and investment houses: $12.9 billion to Goldman and Sachs, $2.3 billion to Citibank, and remarkably nearly $12 billion to Deutsche Bank of Germany, the same to Socit Gnrale of France, $8.5 billion to Barclays Bank of England, $5 billion to UBS of Switzerland (now under investigation for running a tax avoidance scheme for the very wealthy).  To add insult to this injury, the very bankers who caused the catastrophe are paying themselves retention bonuses totaling over $165 million in order to avoid losing talent. Apparently, it takes a lot of talent to lose hundreds of billions.  Instead of using our money to bail out the folks that got us into this mess, why dont we help the generation that well rely on to dig our way out of the hole?  College tuitions have been rising faster than inflation  theyre up about 58 percent since 2000. Grants havent kept up. As a result, students are taking on more and more debt. These days, two of every three students graduates with debt, and that debt averages more than $21,000.  For the children of middle- and low-income families, the debts are much higher. Indeed, increasing numbers of children  the Department of Education estimates as many as 400,000 a year  forgo college or drop out to avoid taking on debt.  President Obama has recognized this problem. In his stimulus plan, he dedicated an additional $15 billion for Pell grants, raising the maximum size of the grant and the number of scholarships. In his budget, he calls for indexing those grants  which go to the neediest students  to inflation. He also calls for moving to direct lending, saving some $4 billion a year from subsidies to the banks, and using that to pay for the changes.  But as the president knows, the increase comes nowhere close to moving Pell grants to covering 70 percent of the costs of college, which they once did in the 1960s..  Why not forgive student debt as part of the stimulus? Or at least give students the same rates that the banks are getting  which is virtually zero?  The Federal Reserve is essentially printing money to provide banks with easy credit in an effort to help them write down their bad debts and begin to make loans again. Trillions  thats with a t  have been dedicated in loan guarantees, short-term financing and the like to bolster the banks.  So why not do the same for students?
