WASHINGTON  Congressional investigators are criticizing the Obama administration for failing to police deals where banks participating in the $700 billion federal bailout loaned billions of dollars overseas, highlighting the growing political tension over the extent of government involvement in firms receiving taxpayer funds.   A report by a House oversight panel, which was described to The Washington Post in advance of its release this week, raises questions about a $8 billion financing deal for Dubai by Citigroup (recipient of at least $45 billion in bailout funds); a $1 billion investment in India by J.P. Morgan (which got $25 billion from the government rescue); and a $7 billion investment in China by Bank of America (which got $45 billion from the bailout). When the American people find that their tax dollars, which were supposed to be used to get us out of this financial crisis, instead are being used to ship jobs and investments overseas, there will be outrage, said Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, chairman of the domestic policy subcommittee for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The report is a memo by that panels Democratic staff.
