More fallout over insurance giant AIG. The company paid employees 165 million dollars in bonuses after getting billions in federal bailout money.   Top aides say President Barack Obama was first informed of the multi-million dollar AIG bonuses last Thursday. Now some republicans charge his administration with failing to oversee the funds.   Senator Mitch McConnell said, 'How did the dept. of treasury hand over 30 billion dollars a few weeks ago and not have any idea that this outrage was going to occur?' 'We will take this money back by taxing virtually all of it.' New tax bills aimed at AIG are in the works. The president says he doesn't want a cent of bailout money to go to bonus checks.
