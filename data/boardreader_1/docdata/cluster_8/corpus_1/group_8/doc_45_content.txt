WASHINGTON - Joining a wave of public anger, President Barack Obama blistered insurance giant AIG for 'recklessness and greed' Monday and pledged to try to block it from handing its executives $165 million in bonuses after taking billions in federal bailout money. 'How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?' Obama said. 'This isn't just a matter of dollars and cents. It's about our fundamental values.' Obama aggressively joined other officials in criticizing American International Group, the company that is fast becoming the poster boy for Americans' bailout blues.  The bonuses could contribute to a backlash against Washington that would make it tougher for Obama to ask Congress for more bailout help - and jeopardize the recovery agenda that is dominating his presidency. Thus, the president and his top aides were working hard to distance themselves from the insurer's conduct, to contain possible political damage and to try to bolster public confidence in his administration's handling of the economic rescue effort.  Obama had scheduled a speech Monday to announce new help for recession-pounded small businesses. But first, he said, he had a few words to say about AIG. 'This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed,' Obama declared. He said he had directed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to 'pursue every legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayer whole.' Later, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration would modify the terms of a pending $30 billion bailout installment for AIG to at least recoup the $165 million the bonuses represent.  Bailout steps for AIG totaling over $170 billion since September have effectively left the federal government with an 80 percent stake in the faltering insurance giant.  A call to AIG's corporate headquarters was not returned late Monday.
