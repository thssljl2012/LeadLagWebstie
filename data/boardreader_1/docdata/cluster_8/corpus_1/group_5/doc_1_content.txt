WASHINGTONWall Street financial institutions now being bailed out by the federal government spent millions underwriting the Democratic and Republican conventions weeks before the firms came to Washington looking for a handout.  Two new reports say that billionaires, corporations and labor unions dumped $118 million into the nominating conventions for Barack Obama and John McCain.  Political conventions have become one of the last refuges for the wealthy to pour unlimited amounts of their own money into the political process.  Two private groups, the Campaign Finance Institute and the Center for Responsive Politics, compiled the data from reports required under federal law.  The donors included insurance giant AIG, Ford Motor Co., Citigroup and mortgage lender Freddie Mac.
