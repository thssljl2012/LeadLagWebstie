Well, Citigroup was more than willing to go to the well for its fair share of our tax dollars from the $700 billion bailout. What a deal! A week later, I get a notice from Citibank, part of the Group, that it is doubling my 'fixed for life' interest rate on my visa from 7.99 to 14.99 Variable.  When I called to tell them that there must be a mistake, I was told by a nice man that it didn't matter that I hadn't missed a payment in the 10 years that I had the card. Everyone's interest rate is being raised.  So what was the bailout for? Why didn't the company just raise the interest rates in the first place and leave our tax dollars alone? Could it be for new perks for the officers who now draw $1 per year salary but still get $14 million in incentives or more? What a crime!
