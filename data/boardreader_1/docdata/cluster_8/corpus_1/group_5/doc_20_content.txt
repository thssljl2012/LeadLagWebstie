WASHINGTON  The US government may end up holding stakes in Ford Motor, General Motors (GM) and Chrysler if Congress and the White House reach agreement on a financial bail-out for the Big Three Detroit vehicle makers. Under the proposed $15bn rescue, the treasury would get warrants for stock equivalent to 20% of any government loans. With GM seeking as much as $10bn and valued at $3bn, the state may become the biggest shareholder. The legislation was not clear on what kind of holding the state would take, leaving it the option of preferred, common, voting or non voting shares.  Democrats in Congress drafted the plan to aid GM, Chrysler and Ford with $15bn in loans. The legislation, which allows the president to appoint a so-called car czar, needs 60 votes to overcome a Republican threat in the Senate to stall it in endless debate using a parliamentary manoeuvre called a filibuster.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday suggested former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker as a possible czar to oversee the bail-out.  When asked who President George Bush should name, Pelosi, a California Democrat, told NBC: Somebody like Paul Volcker. Some Senate Republicans on Monday expressed doubts about the Democrats plan, to be voted on in a special session this week.  With President-elect Barack Obamas Illinois Senate seat now unoccupied, the Democrats majority has narrowed to 50-49, including two independents. That means Democrats, even if they are unified, must attract 10 Republican votes to overcome filibusters. The newly elected Senate, with at least a 58-42 Democratic majority, will not convene until early January.  A $15bn loan to aid US car makers might only postpone GMs inevitable filing for bankruptcy protection, according to Bank of America analysts.
