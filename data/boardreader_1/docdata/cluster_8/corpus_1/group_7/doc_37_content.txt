Specialist car insurance providers for women and the elderly do not always give drivers value for money, one price comparison expert has claimed.  According to research from moneysupermarket.com, a 30 year-old female driver driving a Ford Focus will pay an average of 388 from traditional car insurance providers, while specialist insurers will charge a price of 622 for annual cover  an increase of 60 per cent.  Further findings revealed that a 60-year-old driving the same Ford will pay an average of 234, while a specialist car insurance provider will charge 431, a figure which is 80 per cent more.  Andy Leadbetter, managing director of insurance at moneysupermarket.com, said specialist car insurance providers may appear to be better value.  'Our research however shows it pays to scour the whole market for the best value policy to suit individual circumstances; paying almost 400 over the odds is an unnecessary expenditure,' he stated.  Research from uSwitch revealed that becoming unemployed during the current economic downturn could lead to a 20 per cent increase in car insurance.  AIG offers health care, car insurance and more.
