 Clearly, we know banks are looking to earn money any way they can these days, what with no-strings-attached bailout money drying up. But news that states are striking deals with banks to deliver unemployment payments via debit cards, then charging transaction fees to the unemployed people carrying them, is just plain infuriating.  The banks are banking on the fact that they've gotten us used to paying fees to get at our own money, or, worse, that we don't even notice when we've paid fees to get at our own money. But to subtract dollars and change from time-limited unemployment payments at a time when no one knows where the next job is coming from adds insult to injury. (Hey, I rarely use cliches, but that one applies.) , and he notes that 30 states have signed deals with banks including Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase. Some unemployed folks have reported being charged fees for making two withdrawals in one day, and for calling the bank's 800-number more than once. Some banks are even charging overdraft fees of up to $20 instead of just declining payments.  On their own, each of these fees may be understandable, but it's the sneaky nature of it all that is so galling. If, when unemployed workers receive their debit cards they also received a short, bulleted, very-clear statement of what they would be charged fees for, then maybe this would be okay. But if it's all buried in yet , then it is not. This needs to be addressed by the states approving these contracts, now.
