In what has been described as a major victory for the new administration, President Barack Obama will today sign his $787 billion (552 billion) economic stimulus bill into law.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will be officially authorised in Denver, the Colorado city where Mr Obama accepted the Democrat nomination for president last summer.  Congress passed the bill on Friday (February 13th) following weeks of negotiation and comprise. However, the bill failed to win the cross-party support the White House had hoped for.  According to Bloomberg, the final version of the bill includes some $300 billion in tax cuts for consumers and businesses, around $250 billion in direct financial aid and a $200 billion public works programme.  The administration says it will protect or create around 3.5 million US jobs, including many new roles in green energy.  The act will also place new limits on executive pay at banks participating in the government-backed Troubled Asset Relief Programme, which include JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup.  Commenting on the bill on Saturday, President Obama said: 'This historic step won't be the end of what we do to turn our economy around, but rather the beginning.'
