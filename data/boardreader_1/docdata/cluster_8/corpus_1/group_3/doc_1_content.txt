'We do know it was not a biological agent.'McMurrey said postal agents found no evidence of threats against AIG or its employees.'There were no threatening mailings connected with this incident whatsoever,' she said. 'At this point, we will conduct no further investigation and are considering the matter closed.'The Amarillo Fire Department Hazardous Material Team responded about 1 p.m. Monday to the AIG Document Center at 2271 S.E. 27th Ave. after a report that an employee's hands began burning after she encountered an unknown substance while sorting mail in a tray.McMurrey said a broken package likely caused the substance to scatter among the mail.The company moved 60 employees to a different part of the facility, and workers in two of the three offices in the AIG building were evacuated, police said.AIG is a nationwide insurance and annuities company that recently received federal help in the form of a bailout.
