Gov. David Paterson is in Washington, D.C., today, pressing House members to pass a second economic stimulus package that would reignite the engine of our economy by sending billions of federal dollars to New York and other states. The great states of this country are facing huge deficits, without the resources to affect them, Paterson said in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee. States need to put our houses in order, Paterson acknowledged, but, at the same time, he said, the problem needs to be addressed holistically by the federal government investing in the states. Congress passed and Bush enacted a $168 billion stimulus bill earlier this year, which delivered tax rebate checks to low- and middle-income taxpayers.House Democratic leaders have signaled a second stimulus measure probably would not include rebate checks, but they are considering a host of other options, including extending unemployment insurance and boosting federal funding for infrastructure projects nationwide.Paterson said he was appearing on behalf of New York and other struggling states to present our case for federal investment in state water and food projects and more spending on food aid and other social programs to help jump start the economy.In stark terms, Paterson described the fiscal crisis in New York and the looming economic problems in as many as 39 states bracing for deficits in fiscal 2010. The most essential way the House and Senate can help our country is to reinvest and reignite the engine of our economy, which we see as our states, Paterson said. Paterson asked Congress to consider helping states by:_ Boosting spending and eligibility for food aid. Food stamps are the best economic stimulus, Paterson said. _ Increasing federal spending on block grants to states._ Spending federal dollars to build roads and repair bridges and water treatment facilities. Infrastructure repair (is) something this country has not addressed in the last 50 years. Some economists have been skeptical that infrastructure spending would provide the kind of immediate economic relief desired in a new stimulus package, because projects could take too long to get under way.But Paterson said in New York alone there are 40 shovel-ready programs for improving highways and bridges and another 50 programs are ready to go in the area of water projects. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., said he hoped the hearing, which will continue throughout Wednesday, would convince House members to come back after the election to pass some kind of economic relief package.Rangel said he hoped lawmakers would realize how important economic recovery is and the leadership of both parties would be able to . . . come back after the election to see what we can do to provide the assistance to local and state government as we have found ourselves able to do with our banking and finance industry.
