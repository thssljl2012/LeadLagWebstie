And while the debt markets can be baffling, the banks involved can't claim ignorance because they invented the complex products that have wreaked the havoc.So how did the chiefs of finance fool even themselves?Greed played a role, but studies of business blunders suggest corporate bosses make such cock-ups for another reason: plain old overconfidence.But let's first consider the history of the risky debts. The 1980s ancestors of subprime loans were mortgage-backed securities, a bundle of housing loans gathered together into a security which paid a return. The idea was a stretch even for innovative Wall Street firms, and investment bankers had to work hard to convince sceptical investors to buy the assets.But from these humble beginnings, trading in mortgages spread into new and riskier fields. Banks bundled high-risk debts together, euphemistically naming them 'subprime' mortgages. These were diced up and combined with other less risky loans, before credit rating agencies gave their stamp of approval.They also concocted ways to bet on all manner of outcomes, such as weather futures.Plenty of unaware investors, including some charities and local councils, bought these goods, and the US subprime market alone grew to about $US2500 billion.But the biggest casualties have been the financial engineers who invented them.Their alarm bells should have rung louder than anyone's, but instead the financial powers loaded up their balance sheets with exotic securities.Highly indebted companies and households have also fuelled the crisis, but it's worth exploring how so many experts made such monumental blunders.We know groups tend to throw rationality out the window and 'join the herd' when booms happen. But painting the crisis as one of mass idiocy, however satisfying, is a tad simplistic and unlikely to say a lot about its origins.Besides, most evidence suggests the people working on Wall Street were intelligent by conventional measures. Working in an investment bank now looks less attractive by the day, but in boom times, students with high marks - attracted by the huge bonuses - fought fiercely for a job on Wall Street.Rather, research on how we make decisions suggests that stuff-ups happen because of a common trait in business: overconfidence. This simple flaw goes a long way to explaining the recent collapses, and the excessive corporate borrowing that's brought the likes of Allco Finance and Centro to their knees.The Australian academic Dan Lovallo and the Nobel Prize-winning behavioural economist Daniel Kahneman found that despite their superhuman pay, executives are all too human in assessing their abilities.In the Harvard Business Review in 2003, it was said executives often made bad decisions despite strong evidence that should have deterred them.They did this mainly because bosses suffered from 'delusional optimism' - thinking they were more in control of situations than they really were.When things are going well, managers overplay their own influence on this success, as browsing through most annual reports will confirm.Comments from a former American Insurance Group executive, Joseph Cassano, show how managers can convince themselves they are in control, rather than taking risks.Cassano was in charge of the firm's credit default swap business, which brought the giant to the brink of collapse.'It is hard for us, without being flippant, to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of these transactions,' he said last August, The New York Times reported.Bosses also take credit for the record profits and pay themselves bonuses in the millions. The chief of the fallen giant Lehman Brothers, Richard Fuld, made $34.4 million last year, and could now face legal action from creditors.When things go wrong, on the other hand, corporate chiefs blame things they can't control, like the weather. Or lately, banks confronted with plunging share prices have complained about forces such as short-selling and stock-lending. In April, Fuld was quoted as saying hedge funds 'actively colluded' to bring down Bear Stearns.Of course, the tendency to exaggerate control of a situation and our own abilities isn't exclusive to the big end of town. The study quoted figures showing 70 per cent of college students think they are above-average leaders, and only 2 per cent below-average. But in the corporate world, it's something firms actively breed.The study said managers had an automatic tendency to be optimistic from the outset when they were putting together a proposal and selling its virtues.'Every company has only a limited amount of money and time to devote to new projects. Competition for this time and money is intense, as individuals and units jockey to present their own proposals as being the most attractive for investment,' it said.These 'rose-coloured glasses' continue to colour the thinking of managers as their business ideas are implemented. Scepticism, on the other hand, is regarded as disloyalty and punished by denying bonuses to less optimistic staff.The markets are constantly pressing for higher returns, especially in investment banks with turbo-charged profits beyond their corporate peers.Even in the tamer business of insurance, the urge for risky profits got the better of AIG.It was the company's peripheral business in insuring against the risk of credit defaults - not everyday policies for storms or car accidents - that almost brought down the empire.Delusional optimism can affect all decisions - from paying too much in a takeover to building an unnecessary factory - but the element of self-deception remains.So does this mean optimism is something huge corporations should stamp out? Not at all.The wheels of capitalism depend on businesses backing their ideas. Optimism also gives people enthusiasm to tackle challenging tasks and resilience when things go pear-shaped.The collapse in inter-bank lending - likely to stifle economic growth in months ahead - shows the effect of a collapse in confidence.Markets have a history of overshooting, leading to a bust before things eventually recover. But crises like this are a stark reminder that a healthy dose of scepticism is always a good idea, no matter how buoyant things seem.Ross Gittins is on leave.
