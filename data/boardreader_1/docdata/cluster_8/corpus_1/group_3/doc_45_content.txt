 Dont I remember after Hurricane Katrina that the insurance companies would not pay for a lot of the damage to peoples homes? Why should the American taxpayers spend $700 billion to bail out AIG Insurance and Wall Street investment banks?It is time the politicians in Washington stop thinking about their good buddies who give donations and start thinking about the taxpayers who voted them into office. No $700 billion bailout!
