John McCain came under fire early today after dismissing White House rival Barack Obama as 'that one' in a potentially incendiary TV debate flashpoint.There was no love lost between the presidential candidates in a testy showdown that saw them repeatedly clashing over the causes and cures for the deepening global economic crisis.Trailing badly in the polls and under huge pressure because of his stumbling over the economic crisis, Mr McCain was desperate for a knockout blow to lift his campaign off the floor.Embrace: Barrack Obama and John McCain greet at the start of the debateThe debate did not get as nasty as some of the mudslinging over the past few days. But a foul was called when Mr McCain, 72, was accused of patronising his 47-year-old Democrat opponent in a heated exchange over energy policies.Referring to an energy bill backed by President Bush and his Vice-President Dick Cheney, Mr McCain asked: 'You know who voted for it?'Pointing at Mr Obama, sitting across the stage on a stool, he sneered: 'That one! It wasn't me.'The remark was being compared today to former President Bill Clinton's infamous reply when he was quizzed at a 1998 White House press conference about his relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky and said: 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman.'Political analyst Jeffrey Toobin told CNN: 'That moment when he said 'that one' and referred to Barack Obama that way is going to be memorable - and I don't think it is going to be a happy memory.'The comment ratcheted up the tension half way through the 90-minute debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.And Mr McCain and his wife, Cindy, left the debate hall long before Mr Obama and his wife, Michelle, after apparently snubbing the Illinois senator's bid to shake hands after the debate. Both of the wives also stayed apart without the usual handshake.During most of the first half, the candidates clashed over America's nose-diving economy, with Mr McCain proposing a plan for the government to buy up bad housing loans and renegotiate them at a more realistic price following the market freefall.While both men were polite to each other during the first debate a fortnight ago, they barely looked at one another this time and there were a series of irritated exchanges.During an argument over Iran, Mr Obama almost lost his cool demeanour when he complained that his opponent kept implying he was 'wet behind the ears'.He went on to mention an incident where Mr McCain once sang 'Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Iran' to the tune of the Beach Boys hit 'Barbara Ann' and questioned his claims that he was a seasoned and responsible leader.'I hate to go into that,' retorted Mr McCain. 'I was just joking with a veteran friend.'The tit-for-tat exchanges continued with Mr McCain saying that understanding Mr Obama's tax plans was 'like nailing down jello' and Mr Obama saying that Mr McCain's 'straight-talk express has lost a wheel'.Mr McCain said Americans were 'angry, upset and a little fearful' about the financial collapse. He said the answer was energy independence and lower taxes for everybody.He also said he would re-negotiate bad home loans if he becomes President.'We are going to have to do something about home values,' he said. 'As President of the United States I would order the Secretary of the Treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages of America and renegotiate at the diminished cost of those homes.'He didn't offer an explanation of how he would fund the initiative, but added: 'Until we stabilise home values we are never going to turn things around, get jobs and get America working again.''The rescue package is not enough,' he added before detailing his record as a reformer with a history of working with Democrat opponents to get action. He also pushed the idea he mentioned during the first debate for a spending freeze in Washington for everything but defence and veteran affairs.The two men stalked around the stage but barely glanced at one another. The first hint of vitriol came when Mr McCain accused Mr Obama of claiming $3million for an overhead projector at a marine science centre as part of his bids for federal funding for his Illinois constituents.Mr Obama ignored the slight, focusing on his plans to revive the economy.'We are in the worst financial crisis since the great depression,' opened Mr Obama, who blamed eight years of the Bush administration for the mess, a theme he returned to several more times.He said step one was the 400billion bail-out package passed by Congress last week and step two was tax cuts for the middle classes.He also said people were tired of the excesses of Wall Street.And he highlighted claims that AIG insurance executives went on a $400,000 'junket' just a week after the Wall Street giant was rescued by the government. 'Those executives should be fired,' he added.'I have to correct a little of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly,' he said in reference to a claim by the Republican candidate that he warned of problems in the sub-prime mortgage market two years ago.Of the American people, Mr Obama said: 'You are not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. You want to know how we are going to get you out of this mess.'He added: 'I am confident about the American economy - but we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington . We are going to have to help ordinary families stay in their homes and pay their bills.'Rather than facing a sole questioner, the candidates took questions from a hand-picked audience of 80 independent voters who have yet to decide whom they will back on November 4.Also unlike other debates, the candidates were not slipped the questions beforehand.The face-off came after a bruising few days of increasingly bitter electioneering.But attempts by Republican nominee Mr McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin to go on the offensive with personal attacks on Mr Obama were gaining little traction with America still in the grip of a financial meltdown.Most polls show Mr Obama pulling away from his rival because of his more sure-handed approach to the nation's economic travails. A new Gallup survey gave him a 50-42 point lead last night.A CNN survey into who won the debate gave a resounding victory to Mr Obama by 54 per cent to 30.With less than a month to go before the presidential election and the credit crunch showing no signs of easing, time is running out for the McCain camp.The more casual town hall format of the debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, was said to suit the 72-year-old Arizona senator, who prefers greater interaction with the audience. But Mr Obama appeared equally at home.The second of three debates between the candidates was set up so the candidates could roam the stage in a less structured environment than their first meeting a fortnight ago and take questions from the public.The sour mood in the debating hall is likely to get even worse on the campaign trail.Mrs Palin, 44, told Florida voters yesterday that the mudslinging is far from over.You are going to have to hang onto your hats because from now until election day it may get kinda rough, she said.With the pressure on, the Alaska governor is targeting Mr Obama's judgment and character in speeches that include the unsubstantiated charge that he has close ties to William Ayers, a former member of a militant group responsible for a string of Vietnam-era bombings in Washington.I am just so fearful that this is not a man who sees America the way you and I see America, Mrs Palin told a rally of 5,000 supporters in Florida's heavily Republican city of Clearwater.There is one debate left on the calendar before Election Day - an October 15 gathering at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, that will focus on the economy and domestic policy.Share this article:View allAdd your commentsComments (0)No comments have so far been submitted.
