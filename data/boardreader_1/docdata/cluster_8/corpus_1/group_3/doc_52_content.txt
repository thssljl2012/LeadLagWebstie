 pm US/Eastern  ReportingPaul Martino (KDKA) It started out as a three-page proposal and now it's basically 109 pages of dry, confusing language and the bottom line is you'll be on the hook for up to $700 billion in bad loans. The hope is, if the banks get the bad stuff off their books they can start making mortgage and car loans again, which will spark the economy. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 proposes to stabilize the economy by buying up $700 billion in bad mortgages, clearing them from the balance sheets of banks. 'The banks that lend money, don't have the money to lend because they made such bad loans in the past,' said Rick Applegate, a First Commonwealth Bank financial advisor. Applegate says once we buy up the bad loans and get the banks off the hook, the theory is that the banks can give more credit and consumers can spark the economy by buying homes and cars. But the act, as amended, requires taxpayers to benefit from any future growth the banks experience because of the buyout. 'We've been told by the President and by the Congressional leadership that it's very likely it may not cost us anything if these mortgages begin to perform again,' said Applegate. And the bailout bill prohibits that 'executives who made bad decisions should not be allowed to dump their bad assets on the government and then walk away with millions of dollars in bonuses.' 'They can walk away with big, big dollars and big umbrella packages to protect them, but not to protect the shareholders from what they've done,' says Applegate. But the proposal would try and do away with the big bonuses and golden parachutes. ( MMVIII, CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.)Featured Slideshows On KDKA.com          More Slideshows
