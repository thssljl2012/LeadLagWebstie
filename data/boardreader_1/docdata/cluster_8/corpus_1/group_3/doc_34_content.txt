Ben Smith offers a Democratic perspective on Campaign '08.Jonathan Martin views the campaign from the Republican side.A blogger's eye view of Capitol Hill.Provided byWhen John McCain announced Wednesday that he was suspending his campaign to tend to the nation's economic crisis, a top aide said McCain wanted the presidential candidates and members of Congress to 'lock themselves in a room for the next 100 hours' to achieve 'consensus on something.'Yet on Thursday afternoon, McCain swept into Washington, walked to his office with pal Joe Lieberman, said little at a contentious White House meeting, did a few TV interviews, sped off to his home and proclaimed, through a spokesperson, that he was 'optimistic' about bringing House Republicans 'on board.'McCain's high-wire intervention in the financial crisis is his latest showstopper move - and his riskiest. He might succeed, but the candidate's penchant for the dramatic has also raised anew potentially damaging questions of his age, executive abilities and, most of all, his temperament.'He has been pretty erratic - there's no other way to describe what we've seen out of this guy in the last week,' an Obama aide said of McCain's conduct during the financial crisis.Another Democratic official cited McCain's 'erratic, all over the map response to the economic crisis.'Republican consultant Scott Reed dismissed such talk, saying the GOP's candidate has remained consistent - as a maverick. 'McCain isn't doing anything than he hasn't always done - he needed a game changer to get out of the shadow cast by being a Republican in an economic crisis,' he said.McCain's aides dismiss attacks on the Arizona senator's temperament, saying that he's simply being himself - and that he has confounded his critics by surviving two years of stressful campaigning without public signs of his legendary temper.'Of course, we're aware of fact that the Obama campaign thinks that's a winning tactic,' said a top McCain aide. 'They've used language since the start of this campaign indicating they want to use temper as an issue.'But McCain's attempt to shift the argument from the economy to character has, perversely, given Democrats an opening to question his own fitness to lead. Spur-of-the-moment decisions - from his choice of a running mate he hardly knew to his request that the first debate be delayed - reflect an impetuousness he's tried to associate with Obama's youth, his critics say, while undercutting his argument that he's a cool, tested old hand capable of coping with presidential pressure.'Throughout the course of this crisis, Sen. Obama has shown voters that he would be a steady hand at the wheel were he to be elected president at a time of crisis, and I don't know that voters would have gotten the same impression having seen John McCain over the course of this same week,' said Obama spokesman Bill Burton.Questions about McCain's temperament - some overt, some not - have long been a feature of his political career. He's gotten into profanity-laced shouting matches with fellow senators and other officials, and he jokes that nobody's ever suggested he should get a prize for congeniality.In March, the Democratic National Committee labeled him 'Senator Hothead,' and circulated to reporters a quote from Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who said earlier this year that 'the thought of [McCain's] being president sends a cold chill down my spine.... He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.'That line of attack, however, seemed to subside - until this financial crisis.Nearly two weeks ago, as the crisis dominated the news, McCain claimed that the fundamentals of the economy were 'strong,' then quickly corrected himself, saying the economy was 'in crisis.' This week, he defended his running mate, Sarah Palin's, suggestion that America risks another Great Depression.After initially opposing the $85 billion bailout of insurance giant AIG, he backtracked and supported it.Then he called for the firing of SEC Chairman Chris Cox, claiming he had 'betrayed the public's trust' - only to later soften those comments and call him a 'good man.'In an interview on '60 Minutes' last Sunday, McCain surprised fellow Republicans by saying he would replace Cox with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who has investigated Wall Street corruption.Then came the big, roll-the-dice moves this week.On Wednesday, McCain announcing he'd 'suspend' his campaign to deal with the crisis and called for the postponement of the first presidential debate, scheduled to take plan in Oxford, Miss. Friday night.The move was ridiculed by Congressional Democrats like Majority Leader Harry Reid, who called it an attempt to rescue not the economy but McCain's failed campaign.Obama resisted calls to delay the debate.'I think it is going to be part of the president's job to be able to deal with more than one thing at once,' Obama told reporters on Wednesday.It was part of the self-consciously cool and level tone Obama has maintained all week. The Democrat's campaign thinks voters will absorb the contrast.Obama is 'trying to make it look like a desperate measure - and to do it by using something people already believe about McCain's character,' said one Democratic official. Obama is trying, he said to make McCain 'look wacky.'But the attempt to draw a contrast with McCain's character may carry risk for the Democrat as well. McCain has been quick to invoke his service in Vietnam, and the ghosts of previous attacks on his stability, in response to any shots. Republicans could also use overt attacks on McCain's temper - something the Democrats have shied away from so far - as a cover to launch their own character-based attacks.For now, though, McCain aides said they view not-so-subtle references to their candidate being 'erratic' as mere bait to anger McCain so that he'll prove the allegation, perhaps in one of the three debates that may or may not begin Friday night.
