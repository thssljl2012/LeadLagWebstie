 by Hilarie Stelfox, Huddersfield Daily ExaminerA COUPLE of years ago I recall visiting my building society and thinking, as I walked through the posh plate glass doors and into the softly-carpeted banking hall, that such institutions must have money to burn if they could afford lavish interior design.And then it occurred to me that it was in fact my money  or, at least, some of it  that was paying for the solid beech counters and plush seating in the coffee corner.Not to mention the directors remuneration  details of which drop through my letterbox every year in time for the annual general meeting.The Man-in-Charge always exercises his right to vote against the remuneration packages  as do I since he pointed them out to me  on the grounds that he works damned hard for his considerably lower income and cant imagine what such people do to justify being paid 300,000 a year or more.And now, of course, the lavishness and the greed are all coming home to roost.What I dont understand  and there is much that I dont understand about the world of high finance  is how banks and building societies can be so profligate with our money and get away with it.Ten years ago I knew someone whose husband worked for Barclays Bank and whose salary read like a telephone number. She was employed by the Halifax as a meeting facilitator on 200 a day (back then quite a considerable sum) and was flown around the UK to get banking officials talking to each other because, quite clearly, they were incapable of doing this themselves.In theory investors have a say in what their bank/building society does, but, in reality, they do whatever they like.Theyve even continued paying bonuses to people who have been watching their institutions going down the pan.Perhaps its time for the ordinary shareholders to start taking more of an interest in what goes on.So the next time the directors of your building society recommend that you vote yes for their remuneration packages and proposals, give it some serious thought before making your mark.
