Mandates are a key part of comprehensive health care reform legislation that will be considered next year in the Senate.  Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., announced the broad outlines for a health care bill that the Senate Finance Committee will take up, possibly in the first half of 2009. Baucus, who chairs the committee, said he has consulted with Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who chairs another committee that also has jurisdiction over health care policy. Baucus said the two senators are very much on the same page. Their goal is to provide health care coverage to all Americans. Under Baucus plan, individuals would be required to obtain health insurance. This is necessary, the senator said, to end the shifting of medical costs from the uninsured to the insured. Creation of a nationwide insurance pool would make coverage more affordable, and Americans in the 55-64 age range could buy into Medicare. Premiums for low-income Americans would be subsidized.
