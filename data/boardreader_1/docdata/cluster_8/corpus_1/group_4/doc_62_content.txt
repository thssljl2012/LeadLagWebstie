'He ate a sheep and a wise man,' said Deborah Breen of Brewster, New York, whose American bulldog Achilles made a snack of her holiday decorations. 'He didn't need surgery, but between the emergency room visit, testing and medication, the bill still came out to about $400. He was a little out of sorts for a week or so, but once everything passed, he got better.'  Veterinary Pet Insurance (VPI), the nation's oldest and largest provider of pet health insurance, has received more than one million claims for pet accidents and illnesses this year, including Achilles' dietary indiscretion. VPI's data reveals that non-routine veterinary expenses are a costly reality of pet ownership. Amid economic woes and approaching holidays, pet owners unprepared for a pet's medical emergency may have to curtail spending on gifts. To put some perspective on pet care costs, VPI tracked average claim amounts for some of 2008's most common conditions and compared those amounts with prices on a selection of this year's top gifts.*  If your pet gets You may not be able to get 1.

'The options are to create a dedicated pet savings account, designate a credit card for pet emergencies, purchase a pet insurance policy, or all of the above.
