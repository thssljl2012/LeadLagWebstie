First Takeaway: The first estimate of how the economy did from July through September wasn't a surprise, and it was actually better than some head feared, but it still marked a very important turning point, making it the major story in the financial press today.For the recession is here. The economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest G.D.P. rate since the third quarter of 2001. The crucial element of consumer spending fell by an annual rate of 3.1 percent, the first decline in 17 years.'Consumption literally caved in,' the economist Allen Sinai tells the New York Times. 'It is a prelude to much worse news on the economy over the next couple of quarters.'Well, at least things are looking up for Joe the Plumber, if not his candidate.The slowdown, of course, is global, not just in the United States. Today, the Bank of Japan cut its already-near-zero interest rates, to 0.3 percent. There some dissent, Bloomberg News reports, as three members of the bank's eight-member board sought to cut the rate to 0.25 percent,Barclays has announced that it was raising 7.3 billion, or $12 billion, in new capital from investors including Qatar and Abu Dhabi. In doing so, the British bank is spurning Her Majesty's Bank Funds for Times of Terrible Trouble.Finally, does American International Group not consult advisers on its corporate image? Even after the emergency rescue by the Federal Reserve, the company seems clueless about how the public will judge the way it does business.A.I.G. is tapping a new Fed lending facility to pay back part of the $123 billion in loans from the Fed.The arrangement probably makes great financial sense, but the company seems to have forgotten about those lawmakers in Washington who were screaming at their former executives just a few weeks ago.As the Financial Times says with considerable understatement: 'The decision to use one government facility to repay another could raise eyebrows among Washington politicians who have attacked A.I.G. for paying for a corporate retreat and spending money on lobbying following the Fed bail-out.'A.I.G. has stopped those activities. But it is still playing mind games with Washington.See more inLoading...Add Your CommentComments*0/2000Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*)Display Name:I agree that submitting a comment constitutes agreement to the User Agreement and Privacy Policy.Display Name *This will be displayed next to your comment.Email Address *Sign-up for Portfolio's Top 5 and get the day's most important business news stories delivered to your in-box.Remember meSelecting 'Remember me' allows you to make comments on the site for 30 days without having to enter your name and email address each time.
