 MY domestic worker, Jane Fihlawe Moshani, has a savings account at Standard Bank at Rink Street with a pin number and a debit card, so she can utilise her account on the ATM. On a consultant's advice she has a limit of R1000 a day.  Recently when she went to draw money, she found that more than R2000 had been drawn from her account. On reporting the loss, a statement showed this money had been spent at a "pub and grub" in New Brighton. Her bank card has always been locked in her possession and no one else's. Her pin number is her own secret, and she is most careful when using it and makes sure that no one can overlook her at the ATM.  The bank has also reported this loss to the fraud account at Standard Bank. This fraud has been reported to the police and Jane has signed a sworn statement.  If her card is kept safely locked up and no amount over R1000 should be drawn, then I can only conclude this is an "inside job" by someone who has access to Jane's account details. If you think your money is safe in a bank, don't bank on it! B Lindesay, St George's Park, Port Elizabeth
