While interest rates have settled around 7.75%, a few short months ago it was a different story.  Many people with a home loan felt the pressure to lock in a single-digit rate before, as some forecasters proclaimed, the rate soared above 10%.  Those home owners, such as Martine Poulain, have watched in horror as the interest rate has dropped.  In February, Ms Poulain fixed her Commonwealth Bank home loan at 8.4% for three years and was advised there would be a small payout cost, possibly $5000, if she broke the fixed-rate contract in favour of a variable rate.  After watching the Reserve Bank drop the rate twice in recent months, she decided there was no harm in asking the bank how much her break fee was.  The woman rang back and asked if we were sitting down and I thought, okay, it is more than $5000 and then she said $22,600, Ms Poulain said.  I guess the lesson is that you really need to do your homework and ask all of the questions before signing. We were flustered and I admit freaked out with what the media were saying.  Smartline Buderim mortgage adviser Bruce McAnally said home-loan customers should speak to a professional before making a decision.  Basically the bank gets fixed-rate money in the wholesale market at certain rates. They then guarantee that rate to the customer for that length of time.  But if down the track the customer wants to break the loan, then the bank loses out. If the locked-in rate is 8% and todays rate is 7%, the bank will not be able to sell the old rate to anyone and someone has to pay for that loss.
