The bank has apologised after double the amount of money was deducted from some accounts following bill payments and withdrawals yesterday.  Some accounts were also credited with more money than they should have been when transactions were accidentally duplicated.  It is thought that internet banking customers have been most affected, although there have been reports of ATM transactions going awry.  Have you been affected? Tell us below  A statement from the bank apologised to customers affected by the processing error and said those in immediate need of cash should visit one of their branches.  It also insisted no fees or interest would be charged to customers as a result of the problem.  Commonwealth spokesman Bryan Fitzgerald has admitted they have 'no idea' how many customers have been affected, but that everything possible was being done to rectify the situation.  'Were trying to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can.,' Mr Fitzgerald told 3AW radio.  'Our customers are our main priority and we apologise to them for this glitch.'  Mr Fitzgerald advised customers who performed a transaction online or at an ATM yesterday to check their accounts.
