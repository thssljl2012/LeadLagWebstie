MAY I ask the person who kindly removed two trailing ivy and then came again and stole violas from the newly planted mangers on the barriers at the bottom of Kirkham Lane, to buy their plants like everyone else does?   Their careful removal would indicate that it is not loutish behaviour but a simple act of theft, no doubt to fill a planter for personal use. These plants were kindly donated by Barclays Bank and their staff were good enough to plant them up after a hard days work. Needless to say if anyone has any information whatsoever I would ask them to contact the police.   CCTV is active in this area and hopefully the culprit will be caught and duly dealt with by the law. As residents are aware, most of the gardening in Pickering is done by committed volunteers and it is so annoying that the minority spoil it for the majority. Please be vigilant and report anything suspicious so that this despicable behaviour can be nipped in the bud now.
