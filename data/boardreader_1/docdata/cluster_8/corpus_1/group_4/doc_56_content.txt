 Commonwealth Bank customers across Australia found themselves short of money yesterday after an online glitch duplicated withdrawals from their accounts.  The double-up, caused by an overnight processing error, affected NetBank customers.  The bank said it hoped to rectify the problem soon but it could take until this morning.  The bank was deluged by calls from customers seeking clarification about their accounts.  A bank statement said: 'The bank is working to identify the cause of the error and understands how many customers have been impacted.  'Our technical teams are working to rectify the issue and reverse these duplicated transactions as a priority.'  NetBank, the service affected, is the online outlet of the Commonwealth's banking services.  'Any customers impacted by this and who are seeking immediate cash should visit one of our branches,' the bank said.  'No customer will be charged fees or interest as a result of this problem.'  A number of customers have reported additional problems with Commonwealth Bank transactions in recent days.  One customer said the problems had occurred as early as Friday, with automated payments being deducted twice.  Another customer told Fairfax Radio that he pulled into a petrol station at 1am yesterday and went to pay with his credit card but was told there was no money in his account when there was supposed to be more than $5000.  Commonwealth Bank shares yesterday rose $1.55, or 5.1 per cent, to $31.77, broadly in line with the general market.
