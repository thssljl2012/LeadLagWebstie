Up to 200,000 customers were affected by the error, with many waking up this morning to find their accounts overdrawn or missing large sums of money.  In an 'emergency update' news item posted to the NetBank website at 2pm, the company said it would resolve the error overnight.  'We have a current issue affecting the balance on a number of customers' accounts where transactions were performed on the 22nd, 23rd, 24th of November,' it said.  'We have identified a fix to this problem which will be resolved overnight.'  NetBank, with Australia's largest customer base, deducted double the amount of money from some accounts following bill payments and withdrawals.  Commonwealth Bank senior media adviser Steve Batten said the bank was unsure of how many customers were affected.  'Until we confirm the cause we are yet to determine how many customers have been impacted. Our technical teams are working to rectify the issue and reverse these duplicated transactions as a priority,'' the bank said.  Customers seeking immediate cash as a result of the glitch should visit a Commonwealth Bank branch, the bank said.  No fees or interest would be charged as a result of the error.  The bank has advised customers who performed a transaction online or at an ATM yesterday to check their accounts.
