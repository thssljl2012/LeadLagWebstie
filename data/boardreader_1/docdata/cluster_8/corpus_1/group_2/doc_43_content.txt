Before looking at the best options available, however, be warned  these accounts are not for you if you dip into the red each month. For example the new 5 per cent AER (annual equivalent rate) Vantage offer from Lloyds TSB sounds good on the face of it, until you realise that this rate isn't paid unless you have a balance of between 5,000 and 7,000. And should you happen to go overdrawn, even for just one day, you will receive a paltry 0.1 per cent on your balance for the entire month.Although there are more than 20 accounts paying over 0.1 per cent, most only pay their headline rate up to a maximum of 2,500, so you need to pick the one that fits best with the size of the credit balance you keep in your current account.The Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester (A&amp;amp;L) Premier Direct is the best for balances of up to 2,500, but only for the first year while the rate is 8.5 per cent AER  the High Interest Current Account from Halifax pays 5.12 per cent AER, the best bet at this balance longer term.If you maintain a really big credit balance, then take a look at the First current account from Coventry Building Society, which pays 5.6 per cent AER in the first year and 4.75 per cent AER thereafter on balances up to a staggering 250,000. It is only within the very limited 5,000 to 7,000 band that the Lloyds TSB vantage option comes out on top.These days internet banking makes it easier to keep tabs on your money, so you don't have to rely purely on interest-paying current accounts to get the best return. As an alternative option, you could set up an internet-based savings account and you'll easily find a no-strings account paying 6 per cent AER or more.For example, you could opt for the Halifax High Interest Current Account and combine it with a savings account, such as the Internet Saver from Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley, which pays 6.51 per cent AER, or the isaver from Intelligent Finance paying an impressive 6.40 per cent AER. As always, look behind the often misleading headline rates and into the detail to check that you're still getting the best dea.&amp;amp;#149 Andrew Hagger is head of communications at www.moneynet.co.ukTHE growing spending squeeze means more people are considering switching to one of the many heavily advertised current accounts offering a tempting rate of interest on credit balances.
