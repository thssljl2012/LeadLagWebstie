THE Mop fair in Chipping Sodbury has been triumphed as one of the safest, most successful events in years.Changes to the bi-annual funfair, which had been dogged by underage drinkers and anti-social behaviour, caused controversy with residents and traders who claimed the traditional event was turning the town into a theme park. But police say teens and licensed shops took heed of warnings not to cause trouble.Acting Sergeant Neil Whyman said: 'The entire neighbourhood policing team were out on Friday and Saturday including beat managers, PCSOs and special constables.'We deployed officers on foot patrol, pushbikes and in mobile units.'The operation was to make sure the Mop fair was a safe, fun environment with no issues.'Sgt Whyman wrote to headteachers at Yate and Chipping Sodburys three secondary schools ahead of the two-day festivities warning children not to bring alcohol to the fair.Officers still seized gallons of cider, lager, wine, spirits and alcopops but only had to take one inebriated teenager home to her parents.'It was very successful from our point of view,' added Sgt Whyman.'The girl we took home was so drunk she was unsafe. That was exactly why we took steps to prevent teenagers from getting so drunk.'He added: 'I would like to warn parents to make sure they know where their children are, what they are doing and what they consuming.'Some of the alcohol we seized was taken from childrens homes and underage drinkers should be aware we carry test sticks so can easily find out if a bottle of fizzy drink contains vodka.'Mandy Sainsbury, who owns the Ball of Wool shop in the High Street, said the event had not put people off shopping in the town.She said: 'It was quite a positive experience.'It was the first Mop in nearly 20 years that did not adversely affect our trade.'I think the lovely weather played a part but it was also well organised and the advantages of closing Broad Street on Friday were that rides could be sited further into the road giving wider access for pedestrians to the shops.'  Email to a friend Your Say YourDursleyTheSodburyWatch, Chipping Sodbury says...2:07pm Wed 24 Sep 08The MOP fair brought traffic chaos to the town when barriers were placed across the road closing Broad Street. A mixture of busses,coaches and lorries doing 3 (or more)point turns. Delivery lorries parked two abrest outside the Spar Shop effectivley blocking one side of what should have been an open High Street.In the run up to the Mop the Town Council wrote to traders and residents informing them of road closures and parking restrictions on the Friday and Saturday of the MOP. No mention was made of the Thursday eveing, when a ride was positioned and ericted in front of the Spar shop and other large lorries were positioned parked overnight on the pitchings in front of Lloyds Bank.Signs erected in the High Street and Broad street warning of parking restrictions made no mention of restrictions on the Thursday evening.Do Town Councillors not impose restrictions on the Fairground Workers or do the owners of rides simply do what ever they want?
