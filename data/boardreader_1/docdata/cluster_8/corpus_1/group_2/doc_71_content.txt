A CHARITY ball that aimed to raise funds for the Chesil Trust has been cancelled for a second time.The Chesil Trust Spirit of the Sea' charity dinner will no longer be taking place next Friday and organiser Elizabeth Gould said it has cost her at least 1,000. The black tie 60-a-ticket event at the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy was originally planned for July to coincide with the Spirit of the Sea festival but postponed to September due to a poor response.All the money raised would have gone to the Chesil Trust charity, which assists local young or disabled people to take part in sailing and water sports Mrs Gould, of Gavi de Gavi event management, said: 'The problem is that last week I had about 20 people cancel. 'I found it really difficult to sell the tickets even though I approached all different companies in Weymouth. 'It's a real shame that the charity has missed out because I had secured sponsorship from Barclays which was going to match sponsorship.' She added: 'I personally have lost out on at least 1,000 in ticket refunds and from the deposit at the sailing academy. 'The academy was kind enough to let me move it from July to September but in the end I had to pay.' Mrs Gould, who has organised many successful events including a ball at Lulworth Castle that drummed up nearly 9,000 for the Prince's Trust, said it was the first time she had had to pay a deposit for a charity event. She added: 'It's all gone wrong.' Some people complained about the expensive ticket price but Mrs Gould said she had organised similar events in Bournemouth and sold 80 to 90 tickets at higher prices. She said: 'I don't know why big companies in Weymouth and Portland weren't interested in supporting it. 'I spent a lot of time and effort on this and it's a shame it hasn't gone ahead.' Mrs Gould, who is based in Bournemouth, is not letting the experience put her off working in the borough. She added: 'It's very disappointing but perhaps I'll try again next year.'
