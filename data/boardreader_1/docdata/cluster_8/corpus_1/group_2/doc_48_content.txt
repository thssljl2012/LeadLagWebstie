 As a rule, I steer clear of bankers and insurance agents, so if youre affiliated with Bank of America, AIG or Washington Mutual, Im not interested, but, this film is actually really funny. During a Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy report on CNN, two men are seen making out as part of cheeky Howard Stern prank. I am not sure if it is funnier that millions see the two getting it on, or that the news reader has a total lack of humor. While were on the topic, there was a bank closure yesterday in the UK and we had to deal with male bankers comforting female colleagues in a totally inappropriate manner. Well, I guess in all fairness, theyll miss out on their chance to hit on those women at the Christmas party, so good for them for trying.
