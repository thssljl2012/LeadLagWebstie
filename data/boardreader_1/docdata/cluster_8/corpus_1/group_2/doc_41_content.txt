The Birmingham Suit Amnesty is returning with volunteers being urged to put their unwanted suits to good use through charities.Anyone tired of, or who has grown out of, their suits are being urged to donate their apparel which will be used to help disadvantaged people look the part for when they go to job interviews. Last years amnesty collected 1,000 suits.Thrives Birmingham Suit Amnesty grew from an idea at a Thrive Forum. It inspired Graham Nicoll, Regional Centre Head at Barclays Wealth in Birmingham, and Fidelis Hynam, now a fundraiser at Birmingham Childrens Hospital, to put the idea into action.Fidelis and Graham are again helping co-ordinate the amnesty and they rely heavily on local businesses.Graham said: The 2007 event was very successful and we are asking people to donate suits, whatever size or shape, by bringing them to Birmingham Town Hall on  October 10 between 7.30am and 4.30pm. Last year a lot of time, money and effort was spent on dry cleaning so this year we are asking people to get suits cleaned before they bring them in.Mailwash Dry Cleaning, at Broadway Plaza, is running a special offer for suits to be cleaned on the run up to the day. It will cost 5 for a suit rather than 11.Kate Bartram, from Mailwash, said: This is our way of helping the amnesty. We will also be acting as a collection point for suits at Broadway Plaza making it quick and easy for busy city workers to donate suits.Arthur Webb, General manager of Broadway Plaza, one of the amnestys supporters, said: I knew last years event had been very successful. Its such a simple idea. There must be thousands more unwanted suits gathering dust all over the city, with thousands more people without enough money to buy one.Owning a good suit is something many of us take for granted, so to give young people a leg-up on to the employment ladder or something warm to wear is such a gift.Anyone who can help support the Thrive suit amnesty can get in touch with Graham Nicoll by email or 07775 554215, or contact Annie Roberts at annr@dircon.co.uk.Charities who feel they could use the suits to benefit individuals they support should contact: Fidelis Hynam on 0121 333 8539 or 07920 593577.
