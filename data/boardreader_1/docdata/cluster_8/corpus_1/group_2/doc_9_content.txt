IS IT just me, or is anyone else getting ever so slightly bored with the virtual beatification of the Bank of Scotland? It's a bank, for God's sake, a money-making business, albeit one with a long history. As part of HBOS, it borrows money from some of us and lends it to others, and, like other banks, it did obscenely well until the credit crunch, responsibility for which it can hardly claim to be totally immune from, particularly in its mortgage business.As part of Lloyds TSB, it will probably recover, with some painful consequences for some employees along the way. In the meantime it will continue to act like a bank in foreclosing on those who default on loans and repossessing homes where it feels that is necessary. I don't think I'll pull out the prayer mat quite yet.BILL GOODALLBaird TerraceEdinburgh
