Ouko said over 5,000 customers participated in the competition. 'We want to develop initiatives to help our customers achieve their growth goals. For a customer who wins a plot land today, this is a moment of growth as the land will appreciate,' she said. Vivian Igundura, the retail director, disclosed that the bank had also launched two new accounts; the daily interest current account and the term deposit account, which can earn up to 14% interest, depending on the length the money is saved. She said the initiative had improved the bank's balances over the last few months.
