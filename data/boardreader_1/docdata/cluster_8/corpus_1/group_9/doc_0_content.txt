  WASHINGTON (AFP) US lawmakers on Wednesday adopted new rules to block bailed-out firms from paying employees compensation 'not based on performance.' The US House of Representatives approved the text 247 in favor with 114 against -- just weeks after agreeing to impose 90 percent taxes on bonuses paid by companies who have received government bailouts. The law would 'prohibit unreasonable and excessive compensation and compensation not based on performance standards,' according to the text passed by lawmakers.  The measure was sponsored by Barney Frank, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee.  Firms receiving government funds have come under intense public scrutiny since insurance giant AIG was pilloried in March for giving millions of dollars in bonuses to staff, despite posting multi-billion-dollar losses.  Both the Senate and President Barack Obama have expressed coolness about the idea of those proposals.  The latest measures will also have to pass Senate scrutiny.
