The collapse of one of Wall Street's oldest investment banks, Lehman Brothers, has sent global markets into a tailspin and reinforced fears that the world is heading into recession.The Australian sharemarket slumped by 1.8% yesterday to its lowest level since January 2006 as investors reeled from a spate of negative news out of an already-distressed United States.Lehman Brothers' move to file for bankruptcy came as rival Merrill Lynch was bailed out in a $US50 billion ($A62 billion) merger with Bank of America, and as insurance giant American International Group teetered on the brink of collapse.At the same time, 10 of the world's biggest banks flagged plans to set up a $US70 billion emergency fund.Former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan called the crisis a 'once-in-a-century' event that was 'in the process of outstripping anything I've seen, and it still is not resolved and it still has a way to go'.And Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama called it the 'most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression'.The developments sent the main European sharemarkets tumbling more than 4% overnight, while share prices on Wall Street were down almost 3% early today Melbourne time.The recession fears also sent market interest rates into retreat, adding to the likelihood that the Reserve Bank of Australia will deliver another official interest rate cut next month, on top of this month's 0.25 percentage point reduction.Treasurer Wayne Swan tried to sooth nerves, saying local banks did not face the same problems as US ones. 'While our economy is not immune from international financial market turbulence, we are better placed than most countries to weather the storm,' Mr Swan said.Lehman Brothers has lost money in investments tied to the low-end US mortgage market. The collapse has put in doubt the jobs of 25,000 employees, including 130 in Australia.With TIM COLEBATCH, PETER MARTIN
