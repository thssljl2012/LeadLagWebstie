JAPAN'S Nomura Holdings is likely to win an auction for the entire Asian operations of bankrupt Lehman Brothers, two sources said. 'Nomura made the highest bid and they're ahead,' one of the people familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires. The person said Standard Chartered and Barclays also placed bids for the Asian assets, and the winner was likely to be announced as soon as today. Separately, Nomura and Barclays were contending for Lehman's European operations, the second person familiar with the matter said. Barclays last week agreed to pay $US1.29 billion ($1.6 billion) for Lehman's Manhattan headquarters and two data centres in New Jersey. It will pay another $US250 million for Lehman's US business operations. A spokesperson for Nomura declined to comment. Dow Jones Newswires
