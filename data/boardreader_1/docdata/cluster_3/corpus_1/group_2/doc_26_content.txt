HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby has admitted he does not know what role he will have in the banking giant created from the 30bn Lloyds TSB takeover.Mr Hornby also said it is 'very unlikely' any other bidder for HBOS will appear on the horizon.This appears to offer little support for SNP MSP Alex Neil, who wants elders of the banking community to buy out the Bank of Scotland part of HBOS.
