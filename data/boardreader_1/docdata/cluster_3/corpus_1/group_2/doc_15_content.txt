He also pledged the Scottish Government would 'strain every sinew' in an effort to keep as many jobs in Scotland in the wake of the 12 billion takeover by Lloyds TSB of Halifax Bank of Scotland. Mr Salmond made the pledge in exchanges at First Minister's Questions with Iain Gray, making his debut appearance in that role as Scottish Labour leader. Mr Salmond's exchanges with the Opposition party leader were largely consensual, and conducted with little or no party bickering, and in a sombre atmosphere. The First Minister also announced he has called an emergency meeting next Tuesday of the Scottish Government's financial sector advisory board, to discuss the implications of the takeover. Calling for action by the authorities, Mr Salmond said: 'I note today that Russia has outlawed short-selling... American authorities, I understand, have suspended it today. 'And I would urge - and hope the whole chamber would urge - our financial authorities to follow suit.' Otherwise, he said, other financial institutions could 'come under the cosh' like HBOS. Short-selling is the practice of selling shares in the expectation of a falling share price. Mr Salmond described it as 'people selling shares that they have absolutely no title to, with the aim of making a speculative profit out of other people's misery.'First Minister Alex Salmond has urged financial authorities to curb 'short-selling' to prevent financial institutions being laid low by speculators.
