  Settlement is on July 24. Some A$700 million will be offered to the public, with the remainder taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).In May, the Labor government announced it would be lifting the amount of bonds it issued in the fiscal year to end June 2009 to around A$10.3 billion, from an initial A$5.3 billion. The increase was to help boost liquidity in the government debt market where the total amount of debt outstanding has been static around A$50 billion. After running a string of budget surpluses, the government itself has no net debt but keeps cash bonds on issue to support an active market in bond futures.The AOFM said it planned on issuing a total of A$3.3 billion in the new 2014 bond this fiscal year, along with A$2.0 billion of the existing 2021 line. It would also issue around A$5.0 billion of other existing Treasury Bond lines, targeted at those in the shortest supply in the market. The AOFM said it planned to tender A$600 million of the 2014 line on Aug. 11 and another A$450 million on Sept. 15. A tender of A$400 million of 2021 bonds was planned for Sept. 8.The AOFM has also changed the procedure for tenders. Up to now, sales were usually conducted on a Tuesday with all bids to be in by 12:15 p.m. (0215 GMT).Future tenders will now normally be conducted on either a Monday or a Wednesday with a closing time for the lodgement of bids of 10:30 a.m. (0030 GMT).Full details can be found on:
