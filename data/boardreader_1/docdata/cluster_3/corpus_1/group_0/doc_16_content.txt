 St George Bank says its credit quality is 'excellent' and the firm has no exposure to collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) or US conduits.The credit quality of the Sydney-based bank reflected the high quality of the residential and business lending portfolios and prudent credit culture and policies, St George said in a statement.The bank said it had no exposure to sub-prime lending or hedge funds, here or in the US.St George had a conservative balance sheet with a low risk mix of businesses. Australian home mortgages made up 70 per cent of the bank's lending, which had proved to have a much better credit quality than other types of loans, Australia's fifth biggest bank said. Of the bank's business banking, about 95 per cent is secured and 80 per cent is secured by property.St George shares fell $2.41, or 8.42 per cent, to a six-week low $26.20 as of the market close, dragged down by ANZ Banking Group Ltd which announced $1.2 billion in bad debt provisions for the second half.
