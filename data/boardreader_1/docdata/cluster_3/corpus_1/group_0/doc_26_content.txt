 london  Investors from Qatar are now Barclays' largest shareholders, after the majority of existing investors snubbed the bank's 4.5bn cash call. New Asian and Middle East investor now own 16 percent of Britian's third largest bank.The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and Challenger, an offshore investment vehicle set up by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister H E Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabor Al Thani to invest family wealth, own a combined stake of more than eight percent in the British bank following the capital raising.Barclays chose to raise cash from strategic investors after watching the share prices of rivals HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley fluctuate wildly during their rights issues.Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, the Japanese bank, agreed to pay 500m for a guaranteed 2.1 percent stake in the bank. The QIA, Challenger, China Development Bank (CDB) and Temasek, the Singaporean wealth fund, said they would take up whatever was left over from the remaining 4bn worth of stock after existing shareholders were given an opportunity to buy in.Barclays said shareholders signed up to buy 267m new shares, or 19 percent of the 1.5bn shares on offer. As a result, the QIA will hold 6.2 percent of Barclays and Challenger 1.9 percent. CDB, which was already a shareholder in Barclays, will retain its 3.1 percent share in the bank and Temasek, the Singaporean wealth fund, will take its stake from about two percent to between 2.5 percent and three percent.The remaining 1.14bn shares will be taken by previously announced 'anchor' investors  rather than leave the market to soak up unwanted stock.Shareholders were offered three new shares at 282 pence each for every 14 existing shares. But take-up of Barclays' offer had been expected to be low because the company's share price has lagged the offer price since it was announced.'It was a very well structured and intelligent way of raising capital, it avoided the pitfalls that have been associated with rights issues,' said Mamoun Tazi, analyst at MF Global.It is the second time Barclays has raised cash from strategic investors. CDB and Temasek first invested in the bank last year, when Barclays needed extra money to fund its takeover battle with RBS for ABN Amro.
