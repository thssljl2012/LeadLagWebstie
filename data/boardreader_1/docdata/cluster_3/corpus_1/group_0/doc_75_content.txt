 PRIME CBD values held firm, but secondary commercial values fell away according to revaluations for nearly $3billion of property owned by two Australian listed office trusts.Commonwealth Property Office Fund (CPA) and Westpac Office Trust recorded marginal declines in value as yield softened in the sector. Properties in secondary locations saw their capitalisation rates blow out by up to one percentage point, but well-located assets in the central business district were holding up -- just. Commonwealth Property Office's fund manager, Charles Moore, said that in most instances solid underlying property cash flows had resulted in values remaining stable. The 10 properties revalued showed a $58.4 million unaudited decline to $1.66billion over the three-month period to June 30. The weighted average capitalisation rate softened from 6.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent. 'One of the most significant decreases in this latest round of asset revaluations was seen at 120 Pitt Street, Sydney, reflecting the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's lease expiry and staged exit from the building in April 2010 and April 2011,' Mr Moore said. The tower's worth fell 14 per cent to $115 million. The fund's biggest asset -- the 259 George Street, Sydney office tower -- rose 1.1 per cent in value to $415 million. Mr Moore said the fund's net tangible assets remained stable at $1.61 per unit at June 30. He said its development expenditure of $100 million and operating costs were well covered, having negotiated a new $150 million debt facility. It has no debt maturing until the 2010 financial year. Westpac Office Trust also reported revaluations yesterday with its portfolio down 2.37 per cent, or $31.3 million, since December 31, 2007 to $1.29 billion. The trust's weighted average capitalisation rate rose from 5.88 per cent to 6.22 per cent at June 30. The sharpest increase was 1 percentage point for its property in the northern Sydney suburb of North Ryde. Westpac Office Trust will pay a lower gross distribution of 6.65c a unit for this financial year, down from 7.25c a unit last year. Up to financial year 2008, the trust had paid more than 100 per cent of its operating income. The trust's fund manager, Keith Grayson, said: 'We have listened to the market and moved to a sounder basis for distribution. In future we will pay distribution out of operating income.' He added that the whole sector would refrain from paying more than its operating income. As well, the trust had renegotiated debt of $251 million, due next May, for another three years starting from this month, at the old base rate, but at a higher margin. 'In doing so, we will be able to provide our 2009 distribution guidance with clarity and certainty, reflecting the higher cost of funds,' he said. Babcock &amp;amp; Brown Japan Property Trust also saw a 1 per cent fall in the value of its assets, based on independent valuations. Of the six properties revalued, a Tokyo office appreciated by 6 per cent, but the remaining 5 properties declined by 9 per cent. As a result of the revaluations for June 30, BJT's gearing will increase 0.5 per cent to 56.6 per cent. BJT's unaudited NTA per unit was $1.40 at June 30, compared with $1.21 a year ago.
