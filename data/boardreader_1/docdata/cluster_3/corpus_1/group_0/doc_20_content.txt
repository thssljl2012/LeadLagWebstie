 Rising interest rates have overtaken concerns about job loss or illness as the biggest worry facing home loan borrowers, a new survey shows.Some 27 per cent of borrowers surveyed had fears about whether they would be able to repay their home loan in the next year, lending insurer Glenworth Financial said in its latest Mortgage Trend Report.This compares with 18 per cent in the previous year's survey and 15 per cent in 2006. This year's survey, of more than 2,000 people, was conducted over late April and early May and came after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had lifted the official cash rate four times since last August.Official cast rates between August and March rose by a total of one percentage point to a 12-year high of 7.25 per cent.Banks have also increased their rates independently of the RBA, raising their variable mortgage rates by an average additional 40 basis points to cover their increased funding costs caused by the global credit crunch.Of the borrowers who said they could have problems with their repayments, 44 per cent of this group pointed to rising interest rates as a factor that could impair their ability to pay off their loan comfortably.Although the report found that 73 per cent of respondents were confident about making their mortgage payments, Glenworth country executive Peter Hall said it still took an event such as income loss or illness, for a borrower to fail on their loan payments. 'However, when borrowers are already stretched to capacity, the defined event only has to be small to have serious implications,' Mr Hall said. Higher interest rates influenced what type of loan was taken, with half of the respondents saying price - a low ongoing rate and fees - was the top factor.Loan flexibility was the next most important factor, cited by 44 per cent. Loan flexibility was the No.1 reason for choosing a lender, the previous two surveys found.Despite rising oil prices, only two per cent of respondents said they were worried that higher fuel costs would affect their ability to pay off their mortgage. 'In 2006, 24 per cent of respondents stated that petrol price increases would impede their mortgage repayment, and this proportion decreased dramatically to seven per cent and two per cent in 2007 and 2008 respectively,' the report said. Just over half those questioned, 51 per cent, said less than 30 per cent of their income was used to repay their debt, while a quarter said more than half of their monthly income went to repaying their debt, up from 12 per cent in 2007.Longer-term mortgages, those that extended the term of a home loan from the standard 25 years to between 35 and 40 years found favour with 51 per cent of respondents.Even though the average monthly repayment falls for longer term mortgages, the total interest paid over the life of the loan is more.Respondents in Western Australia, at 72 per cent, had the highest level of property ownership, while those in NSW and the Australian Capital Territory had the lowest level of home ownership, 53 per cent, the survey found.
