 LONDON (AFP) - British lender HBOS failed on Monday to raise almost eight billion dollars from shareholders to boost finances hit by the global credit crisis, forcing the underwriting banks to step in.A company spokesman blamed the miserable investor response on a 'fierce financial storm' that has battered the world's banks in the fallout from the collapse of the US subprime home loan market and related credit crunch.Britain's biggest mortgage lender HBOS, seeking to boost its capital after heavy credit squeeze writedowns, said investors had agreed to buy just 8.29 percent of its 4.0-billion-pound or 5.0-billion-euro rights issue.The miserable take-up by HBOS investors makes it the most unsuccessful cash call since British energy giant BP attempted to raise seven billion pounds after the 1987 stock market crash.HBOS said in a statement that underwriting banks Dresdner and Morgan Stanley would try to sell the remaining shares. The pair will be obliged to purchase the stock on Tuesday if they cannot find buyers.In early afternoon trade on Monday, HBOS shares sank once more under the issue price of 275 pence.The stock dived 2.50 percent to 274.96 pence on London's FTSE 100 leading shares index, which was up 0.58 percent at 5,407.40 points. The rights issue 'has been conducted in the middle of a fierce financial storm,' said HBOS spokesman Shane O'Riordain. 'We have seen unprecedented volatility in banking stocks,' he said, adding: 'The bottom line is that we have raised 4.0 billion pounds of capital. 'Just like ships need more ballast in heavy seas, banks need more capital in tougher times. We have now raised that capital.' Under the terms of the rights issue, HBOS investors were offered two new shares at 275 pence for every five held at the end of April when the stock was trading at 500 pence.Since then, it has tumbled badly along with the other banks on deepening concerns over Britain's flagging property market and slowing economic growth.The share price last week fell 275 pence before closing at 282 pence on Friday, which was the issue deadline.Major commercial banks have suffered heavy losses related to complex investments in the US subprime or high-risk home loan market and the subsequent tightening of lending criteria.Other British banks have experienced varying success in their attempts to raise fresh cash from shareholders.Barclays announced last week that only one fifth of its 4.5-billion-pound rights issue had been taken up by existing investors, with the remainder bought by 'anchor' investment groups from China, Japan, Qatar and Singapore.The Royal Bank of Scotland also had to finance the mammoth takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro but with better timing, coming to market first, it had a take-up rate of 95 percent in its record-breaking 12-billion-pound rights issue.Analysts said investors were growing weary of banks looking for more money. 'Banks are already close to raising 20 billion pounds of capital, primarily via rights issues, but there are signs of shareholder fatigue,' said Roger Bootle of consultancy Capital Economics. 'UK banks are unlikely to raise enough capital to maintain their recent rates of lending so even if they overcome their immediate liquidity problems, the credit crunch is unlikely to ease soon.' HBOS claims two in five British households as a customer through its subsidiary Halifax.
