 Lloyds said it was increasing its the money paid out to investors by 2 percent to 11.4 pence (23 cents) per share. But the bank's shares fell 4.4 percent to 306.75 pence ($6.10) on the London Stock Exchange. 'Lloyds has not, of course, been totally immune to the wider credit crisis,' said Richard Hunter, head of U.K. equities at Hargreaves Lansdown, who added that investors' concerns over the sustainability of its dividend had been 'firmly quashed.' 'On balance, the general market view towards the shares remains neutral for the time being,' he said. While other British banks like HBOS and Barclays have been forced to tap their investors for extra cash to survive the turbulence, Lloyds TSB touted its 'robust capital and strong liquidity position,' suggesting the bank would hold off on seeking a multibillion pound (dollar) rights issue like its peers.Already among the country's leading mortgage lenders, Lloyds TSB said it was building new business in a weakening market and now accounted for nearly a 25 percent share of new lending.But the London-based lender's retail banking division  widely seen as insulated from the worst of the market turmoil  saw write-offs increase 4 percent to 655 million pounds ($1.3 billion). The bank was also hurt by a fall in the value of investments at its Scottish Widows insurance business.The statement said credit risk linked to the threat of recession was one of the major challenges facing the bank in the second half, adding that the reduction of house prices could lead to further write-downs.
