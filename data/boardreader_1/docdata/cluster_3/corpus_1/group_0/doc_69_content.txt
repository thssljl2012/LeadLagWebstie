 INSTITUTIONAL investors have placed $1 billion for investment in infrastructure assets with Colonial First State Global Asset Management in the past nine months.The Commonwealth Bank-owned fund manager will now seek to raise a further $500 million for two of its Australian-domiciled unlisted infrastructure funds. It also plans to launch a new infrastructure product into the European market. Colonial head of property and alternative investments James O'Leary said the volatility in equities and fixed incomes in the past nine months helped to heighten interest in infrastructure assets. 'Investors have realised the cost of living with volatilities in these markets,' Mr O'Leary said. Over the past five years, some institutional investors had started to allocate money to infrastructure, which had proved a source of stable returns, he said. The $1 billion, from Australian, European, US and Middle East institutions, has boosted the total infrastructure funds under Colonial First State's management to $3.5 billion.
