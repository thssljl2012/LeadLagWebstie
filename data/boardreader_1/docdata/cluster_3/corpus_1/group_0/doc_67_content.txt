 Average funds dropped 6.4 per cent in value in the year to June 30 as the global credit crisis sent markets into a spin. The loss would mean a worker on $70,000, with a 9 per cent employer contribution of $6300, would have seen $16,403 wiped off a total super investment of $256,300. Figures from research group SuperRatings yesterday reveal $60 billion in value lost from balanced-option funds, which make up about 90 per cent of Australian super fund investments. And worse could be ahead, given a grim outlook for the US and Australian sharemarkets. The All Ordinaries index is down almost 6.5 per cent since July 1. And it took another pounding yesterday after ANZ shares fell almost 11 per cent after the bank revealed its provisions for bad debt had reached $1.2 billion. 'We had a degree of hope sharemarkets would be on the way to recovery, but day after day we're confronted by more bad news from the credit crisis,' CommSec analyst Craig James said. SuperRatings managing director Jeff Bresnahan said the super funds it monitored posted, on average, their worst negative return since compulsory super was introduced in July 1992. He said the June rout on Australian and international equity markets flowed straight through to Australia's major super funds. 'It was the worst possible finish to an already poor year,' he said. 'Worse still is that a number of balanced options posted negative returns well into double digits.' The 6.4 per cent drop contrasts with a gain of 15.7 per cent in the previous financial year. 'As the sharemarket boom caused the super fund spoils of 2003-07, so too was it the downfall for 2007-08,' he said. Exposure to shares and to listed property trusts dragged down balanced funds, which spread investments across a range of different asset classes. The median gap between industry super funds and retail funds grew to 4 per cent. Retail funds' balanced option returns were an average -9.84 per cent; industry funds' average return was -5.78 per cent. Best-performed fund was , which had a 2007-08 return of -1.7 per cent.  was the worst, sliding 15.87 per cent. But superannuation experts also point to robust fund returns, when averaged over three and five years, of 7.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent per annum. Mr Bresnahan said these were the first negative returns since 2001-02 and in line with an expected negative return every six years.
