 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) is thought to be in discussions to reach a settlement deal with the adminstrators of collapsed broker Opes Prime, Ferrier and Merrill Lynch, reported the AustralianThe bank first indicated publicly that it wanted to reach a settlement deal when its barrister Philip Crutchfiel said a class action would not be an 'appropriate vehicle' to reach a conclusive deal. A creditors meeting is scheduled on July 30, after which a clearer idea on ANZ's position is expected to be announced. The adminstrator is expected to ask for the receivor Deloitee to be removed as part of the settlement. Opes Prime collapsed earlier this year as the global credit crunch put pressure on banks to recoup their loans, which the stockbroker used in its margin lending operation. It went into receivership and is being investigated by regulators.ANZ seized shares from Opes as it moved to recover a $616 million loan to the broker.
