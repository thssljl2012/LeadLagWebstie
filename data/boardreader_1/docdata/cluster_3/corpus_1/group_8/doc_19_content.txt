Ailing US bank Citigroup yesterday became an unlikely source of light in the perennially overcast financial sector.   In a leaked memo to staff, chief executive Virkram Pandit said Citigroup had managed to stay in the black during January and February.   The unusually upbeat prognosis raised hopes that the Wall Street giant could turn in its first quarterly profit since the credit crunch erupted in summer 2007.   Its shares jumped as much as 35 per cent , prompting Wall Street to rally by almost 380 points, as investors wagered that the bank may have finally turned the corner.   Shares in UK banks followed suit, with Barclays jumping 6.1p to 67.5p and HSBC up 50p to 399p. More...  However, there were fresh warnings that losses at British banks will soar as the recession deepens.   Sandy Chen at stockbroker Panmure Gordon predicted that Lloyds banking Group will run up pretax losses of 25billion this year and next as it digests stricken Halifax Bank of Scotland.   Investment bank Credit Suisse warned that taxpayers could be facing a loss of over 60billion from the government's toxic loan insurance programme.   Royal Bank of Scotland (up 2p to 21p) and Lloyds (7.1p higher to 50.8p) have placed 585billion of risky loans into the state's asset protection scheme.   Taxpayers could end up handing the banks as much as 65billion in the event of a 'very severe downturn', the Swiss bank warned.   But the insurance policy means RBS and Lloyds now have enough capital to see them through the recession, according to Credit Suisse.
