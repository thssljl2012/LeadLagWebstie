The FTSE 100 Index has fallen by 204.3 points to close at a six-year low of 3625.8.  Having fallen below the 3665 level it dropped to in October at the height of the banking crisis, the FTSE is now at a point not seen since March 2003.  The slump came after HSBC and insurance giant AIG sparked another crisis of confidence for world markets.  Market heavyweight HSBC was the victim of a major sell-off - its shares closed 19 per cent lower - after it slashed its dividend, announced a 62 per cent fall in profits and unveiled plans for a record 12.5 billion rights issue.  HSBC was down 92.25p to 399p, while Standard Chartered, which shares HSBC's focus on Asian markets, fell 77p to 587p.  Elsewhere part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group fell 15 per cent or 8.9p to 49.4p, Barclays was 5.7p lower at 87.7p, and Royal Bank of Scotland was 0.6p down to 22.6p.  Insurers also took a battering on the day that ailing US giant AIG - sponsors of Manchester United - crashed to the biggest quarterly loss in history.  The firm slumped 44 billion into the red in the final three months of 2008 and is in line for another huge bail-out from the US taxpayer.  Prudential, which is interested in buying some of AIG's Asian assets, was 16p lower at 264.5p, while Aviva fell 21.5p to 267.5p.  Elsewhere, Whitbread shares were under pressure - down 6 per cent or 44p to 702.5p - after it said like-for-like sales had turned 'predominately negative' in recent weeks. This reflected a slowdown at the Premier Inn budget hotel chain.  Winners: Admiral up 20p at 875p, Amlin ahead 7.75p at 350.75p, Balfour Beatty up 6p at 324p and RSA Insurance ahead 1.2p at 138.9p.  Losers: HSBC down 92.25p at 399p, Lloyds Banking Group off 8.9p at 49.4p, Xstrata down 94p at 601.5p and British Land off 57.75p at 400p.   Independent Television News Limited 2009.
