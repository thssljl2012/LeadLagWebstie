British bank Barclays moved to quell shareholder anger on Tuesday, offering them a slice of a 5.8 billion pound capital injection by Middle Eastern investors.   Barclays said Qatar Holding and Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan would each make up to 250 million pounds ($372.9 million) of reserve capital instruments available to existing shareholders in the bank in a bookbuilding process.   The bank said no bonuses would be paid to executive directors for 2008 and confirmed an earlier Reuters report that all board members would offer themselves for re-election at the company's annual general meeting in April 2009.   Shares of Barclays rose more than 3 percent in early London trading.
