The billionaire Abu Dhabi sheikh who bought football club Manchester City two months ago is set to pump up to 5 billion into Barclays.The bank unveiled Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the country's royal family, as a major investor in plans to raise up to 7.3 billion to strengthen its finances.Two other existing Middle East investors - the Qatari Investment Authority and Challenger, which represents Qatar's royal family - are also putting up more funds.The trio could own nearly a third of the bank between them following the capital-raising exercise, with Al Nahyan's stake in Barclays a potential 16.3 per cent.The funding move follows an earlier 4.5 billion cash call by the bank in June.Chief executive John Varley said: 'Today's capital raising provides certainty and speed of execution.'He called the move - which has to be approved by shareholders - a 'forward-looking and progressive approach to managing the share register'.Mr Varley said it put Barclays among the strongest banks in the world in capital terms.Qatar Holding and Challenger - a wealthy vehicle led by the Qatari royal family - are already investors in the group.
