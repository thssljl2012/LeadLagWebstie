The handling of the banking crisis will be examined by MPs later as they grill economic chiefs over the bail-out plan.  Chancellor Alistair Darling, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King and the Financial Services Authority chairman Lord Turner of Ecchinswell will face the Commons Treasury Committee. The 37 billion set aside to boost the banking sector has so far been slow to get lending moving again.  The option to plough in taxpayers' money will be questioned after one bank - Barclays - successfully secured extra funding from private investors in the oil-rich Middle East.  Unusually, the committee has invited members of the public to submit questions which they would like to see put to the authorities about the bail-out.  Questions will also be asked on the reliability of the ban on big-money bonuses to bankers.  Announcing the move last month, committee chairman John McFall said: 'Taxpayers are naturally very concerned about the scale of this investment. 'The committee hopes that by providing people with the chance to have us put their questions to those in charge, we can provide a constructive way of engaging the public on a matter of such deep concern to the whole country.'
