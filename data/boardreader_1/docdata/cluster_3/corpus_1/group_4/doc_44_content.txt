Lloyds TSB Lloyds TSB's prospectus  But Lloyds TSB today said they had found a way to repay a tranche of government preference shares  bonuses and salaries as it saw fit. The prospectus sheds an alarming new light on why HBOS came so close to collapse at the height of the banking crisis in September. The circular states that 'a review of non-public information' by Lloyds TSB shows that 'negative net capital adjustments of no more than 10bn' will be needed at HBOS after the acquisition. The amount written off will affect the balance sheet rather than profits of the merged bank.   The precise figure will be revealed when the merged banking group unveils its first half results next summer. Trading updates from Lloyds TSB and HBOS show that both have suffered in the turmoil that has gripped the banking world since the failure of Lehman Brothers on 15 September.   Lloyds TSB warned of a 'substantial reduction in statutory profit before tax' as a result of 'the impact of market dislocation, insurance related volatility and higher impairments'. HBOS also said its profitability 'has been impacted'.   The warnings are in contrast to Barclays  Lloyds wants to raise 4.5bn from investors and HBOS is seeking 8.5bn. If the shares are not taken up, the Government will acquire them. The Government will also directly buy preference shares in the two banks - worth 4bn. Other stories:
