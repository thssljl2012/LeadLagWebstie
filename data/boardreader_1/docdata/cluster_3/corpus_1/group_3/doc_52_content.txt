Lloyds TSB is considering a bid for Singer &amp;amp; Friedlander, the stockbroker owned by bust Icelandic bank Kaupthing, for a push into retail broking.Such a deal would be audacious given Lloyds' plans to rescue HBOS.West End-based S&amp;amp;F would provide Lloyds with an experienced and highly rated team of brokers as well as a sizeable infrastructure on which to build a High Street private-client wealth management business.As well as private banking, S&amp;amp;F's 600 staff offer corporate banking, capital markets and investment services. Last Wednesday S&amp;amp;F went into administration after the Financial Services Authority forced Kaupthing out of business, fearing its collapse, which came days later.Rival mid-market brokerages such as Numis, Evolution and WH Ireland are also thought to be looking. An executive at one said: 'Whereas before we would just have taken teams, on this occasion it could work to buy the whole company.Friday's collapse of Icelandic bank Straumur's 380m (300m) bid for Landsbanki's brokerage operations means Teather &amp;amp; Greenwood stockbrokers will go back on the block, pushing down the takeover premium even further.Kaupthing bought S&amp;amp;F for 547m in 2005.
