LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will launch its biggest retail bank rescue on Monday when the four largest, HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Barclays, ask for a 35 billion sterling ($60.5 billion) lifeline, the Sunday Times reported. The unprecedented move would make the government the biggest shareholder in at least two banks, HBOS (HBOS.L) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), the newspaper said on its website. It did not give a named source for its information. The Sunday Times said Royal Bank of Scotland, which has seen its market value fall to below 12 billion sterling, was to ask ministers to underwrite a 15 billion sterling cash call. It said HBOS, Britain's biggest provider of mortgages, was seeking up to 10 billion sterling, Lloyds TSB (LLOY.L), in the process of acquiring HBOS in a rescue merger, wanted 7 billion sterling, and Barclays (BARC.L) needed 3 billion sterling.
