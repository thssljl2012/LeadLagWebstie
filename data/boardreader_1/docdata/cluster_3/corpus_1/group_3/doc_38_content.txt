A second top-ten shareholder in both Lloyds TSB and Halifax Bank Of Scotland backed their 11.4billion rescue deal, boosting HBOS shares by almost 15 per cent.The Prudential's fund management arm, M&amp;amp;G, became the second major investor to publicly support the merger.It follows days of speculation that a gap between the Lloyds offer and the HBOS price might force City investors to reject the proposal.M&amp;amp;G, which has a 2.6 per cent holding in HBOS and 2 per cent in Lloyds, said: 'We support the deal on the terms as announced.'Support: Prudential's fund management arm M&amp;amp;G and Standard Life Investments both favour a Lloyds HBOS merger, and both are major investorsStandard Life Investments, which has 3 per cent of HBOS and 1.5 per cent of Lloyds, has also thrown its weight behind the deal.The support came as reports suggested Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country's second biggest lender, offered over 1.3billion for HBOS's subsidiary BankWest.CBA denied the offer, but analysts believe it is running the rule over BankWest.Lloyds is offering 83 of its shares for every 100 HBOS. The 'discount' between what Lloyds is offering and what the market thinks HBOS is worth narrowed as shares in the country's biggest mortgage lender rose 22p to 170.1p, valuing it at ;8.9billion. The offer from Lloyds (up 12p at 262p) values HBOS shares at 217.4p, or 11.4billion. It implies the market believes Lloyds should reduce its offer by about 22 per cent.A rescue takeover of HBOS by Lloyds was also backed by Fidelity fund manager Anthony Bolton, who said: 'My personal view on this is that it will succeed and it will go through on the original terms, and I think most parties would like it to succeed on that basis.'The government acted to engineer an HBOS rescue after a slump in the lender's shares following the collapse of Lehman Brothers a few weeks ago. It has waived all normal competition rules.Mike Trippitt, banks analyst at Oriel Securities, said the competition waiver was 'a gift for Lloyds' and he believes there is 'more than a 50 per cent chance' of the deal going through.But, he warned, there are still risks for Lloyds because the combined group will have a 55billion construction and property loan book, equal to 10pc of total loans.It will also have a 338billion mortgage book, accounting for 61 per cent of loans, and which will be extremely exposed to falling house prices and rising payment defaults.Read laterEmail to a friendShare this article:View allAdd your commentsComments (0)No comments have so far been submitted.
