LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Life Investments, a top investor in Lloyds TSB  and HBOS , supports the planned takeover of HBOS by Lloyds under the terms originally announced, a person close to the investment firm said.HBOS shares are trading at a big discount to the indicated offer price, reflecting concern the deal may not be approved by shareholders or will be revised by Lloyds.By 7:14 a.m. EDT, Lloyds TSB shares were up 14 percent at 258.5 pence, giving its offer a value of 214.5 pence. Under the agreed offer, HBOS investors get 0.83 Lloyds shares for every HBOS share they own.HBOS shares were 21 percent higher at 148 pence, making them the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 share index, and putting them at a 31 percent discount to Lloyds' offer price.On Tuesday, the discount rose as high as 35 percent as HBOS shares fell on market talk Lloyds could attempt to cut its offer to 0.6 of its shares per HBOS share.A second investor in both HBOS and Lloyds also expressed confidence the takeover would go ahead.'I don't think there is a danger of the deal falling through. I think the key think is to get the deal done. I won't particularly argue for repricing,' the investor told Reuters.POLITICAL PRESSURECredit Suisse analyst Jonathan Pierce said on Wednesday that 25 percent of Lloyds TSB's top 20 investors had equally big holdings in HBOS, making it more likely the bid will succeed.'Will the deal go ahead? We think the answer is probably yes. Not only is there considerable regulatory and political pressure to get this deal done, but there are considerable cross shareholdings between the banks,' he wrote in a note.Pierce added that the discount between HBOS shares and the Lloyds offer price exaggerated the true risk of the deal failing because of HBOS' vulnerability if it were to remain independent.'The potential downside in HBOS shares in the event the transaction doesn't proceed might be very significant. And so a relatively small risk of failure translates to a large discount,' he wrote.The Lloyds-HBOS tie-up, announced on Sept 18, was facilitated by the UK government, which exempted the deal from competition rules after a steep slump in HBOS' share price stirred fears the bank might fall victim to the credit crunch.On Wednesday, a spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the government remained in contact with Lloyds and HBOS.In an interview with Sky News on Tuesday, Brown said he was confident the deal would go ahead.Standard Life holds about 3 percent of HBOS shares and about 1.5 percent of Lloyds, making it the fourth biggest HBOS investor and eighth biggest in Lloyds, according to Thomson Reuters data.(Reporting by Raji Menon; additional reporting by Myles Neligan and Steve Slater; Editing by Hans Peters)
