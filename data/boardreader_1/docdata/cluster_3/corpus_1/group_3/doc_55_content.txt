Fears are growing that the 38.8bn bailout of Germany's second-biggest property lender Hypo Real Estate might not be enough to save the ailing giant.Shares in Hypo fell by 54% in Frankfurt despite the government's rescue. Investors and analysts said the collapse of an initial rescue when further liabilities emerged cast doubt on Hypo's future.Jeremy Sigee, analyst at Citigroup, said: 'The events of the weekend will likely raise further big questions about the state of the company's balance sheet and its management controls. The government and consortium are likely to prioritise a rapid wind-down (of the bank).'There are worries that this could hit Britain's property and financial sectors, because Hypo is a big player here and in Ireland.Any rapid withdrawal from the market could hit property prices if the lender is forced to sell off assets quickly, at a knock-down price. This could lead to banks and developers having to write down the value of their own property portfolio.Hypo's international division has a team based in the City of London that targets UK property developers and other speculators in the bombed-out sector.The company's own website says its UK team is 'one of the leading providers of real estate financing in the United Kingdom'.Alex Potter, banking analyst at brokerage Collins Stewart, said: 'You can't discount the asset price impact that the loss of a big lender in the market would have. And all the big universals (Barclays, HBOS, RBS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB) are big lenders into this (property) market.'HBOS (down 39.7p at 160.8p) has a 117bn corporate loan book stuffed with property and retail investments. It insisted the loss of Hypo would have no impact on its business.Royal Bank of Scotland (down 38.1p at 148.1p) said it had a 'very, very small exposure' to Hypo.
