Top British lenders lost over 17billion in a stockmarket wipeout, amid fears shareholders could be decimated in a government rescue.Royal Bank of Scotland lost an astonishing 39 per cent of its market value, shedding 58.1p to 90p.Its plunge was exceeded only by a 42 per cent decline by Halifax owner HBOS, which finished down 66.8p at 94p.Lloyds TSB suffered a 13 per cent share-price fall, finishing 33 p lower at 225 , while Barclays shed 9 per cent, ending the tumultuous session down 29p at 285p.Wipeout: The top British lenders lost 17billion in one dayInvestors fled the sector amid speculation the government will step in with a plan to inject taxpayer money in return for substantial stakes in the firms.Adding to the alarm, the International Monetary Fund boosted its estimate of the losses stemming from the sub-prime meltdown to $1.4trillion (800billion) from $1trillion.It called for 'comprehensive, early and decisive' action by governments.Estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research today will show that the credit crunch propelled the UK economy into recession as early as May.City sources said the government will pump up to 50billion of taxpayer cash into four big British lenders - RBS, HBOS, Lloyds and Barclays - in return for stakes in the firms.RBS is in particularly acute need of a handout.Suggestions that the Edinburgh giant could be in line for a 7.5billion equity injection provoked frenzied trading in its shares throughout the session.It is seen as the most vulnerable of Britain's banking giants after dramatically overstretching its finances in the 50bn carve-up of Dutch group ABN Amro and taking on billions of pounds of toxic US debts.A record-breaking 12billion rights issue earlier this year failed to restore confidence in the lender, led by former banking golden boy Sir Fred Goodwin.Yesterday the Scottish firm's market value tumbled to 15billion, a far cry from the 77billion valuation it was trading at this time last year.Prime Minister Gordon Brown last night met with Chancellor Alistair Darling, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King and Financial Services Authority chairman Lord Adair Turner for talks about a rescue deal.Any taxpayer-funded recapitalisation would be dismal news for ordinary shareholders, who face being heavily diluted if the government takes preference shares convertible into ordinary equity.But analysts said such a move is necessary to shore up confidence in the UK's outsized financial sector and thaw out the lending markets.Banks denied they had gone cap in hand to the Treasury yesterday, but there is little doubt as to their burning need for cash.The participation of HSBC in any bail- out is less clear, given analysts do not think it is short of capital and 75 per cent of its earnings come from outside the UK.Its market capitalisation stood at over 100billion last night - nearly twice the value of its four main UK rivals combined.The shares rose 19p to 901p. Bankers are also pushing for a guarantee of all UK deposits.Experts also fear that the UK could be forced to set up a US-style toxic asset dump to stabilise prices of repackaged mortgages.Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics warned that the continued deterioration of the housing market here and in the US, coupled with rising loan defaults, will mean any government rescue is only a temporary solution.He said: 'The erosion of bank capital is a major problem, and this may be best way of addressing it with public money, but it will not be a complete fix.'Read laterEmail to a friendShare this article:View allAdd your commentsComments (0)No comments have so far been submitted.
