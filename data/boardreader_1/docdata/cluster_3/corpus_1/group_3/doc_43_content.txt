LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays will try to raise 7 billion pounds ($12.10 billion) in extra capital from private investors rather than government funds, media reports said on Monday. The BBC and The Daily Telegraph website said the bank would attempt to go it alone while rivals such as Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS receive billions of pounds from taxpayers [nLD636580]. A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment. (Reporting by John Bowker) ($1=.5786 Pound) Keywords: FINANCIAL/BRITAIN BANKS BARCLAYS/ tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomson.com ak COPYRIGHT Copyright
