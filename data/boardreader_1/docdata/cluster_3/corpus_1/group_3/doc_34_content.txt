Dutch financial group ING has said it will sell its Taiwan life insurance unit to Fubon Financial for $600m (344m).It comes a day after securing a 10 billion euro ($13.5bn or 7.7bn) government cash injection.As policy-makers around the world pour in billions of dollars of state cash to help stabilise their banks, financial institutions such as ING and US insurance giant AIG have been selling off non-core overseas assets to help shore up their capital positions. 'ING is affected by the global financial crisis, and they need to adjust their asset allocation as a group,' Fubon President Victor Kung said. 'That is why we got this chance... We are sure we've bought a good company at a very reasonable price.' The Dutch financial giant announced the deal after it became the latest European bank to seek state funding by agreeing to a government cash injection on Sunday.Following a weekend of intense talks after its share price was slashed by more than a quarter in the latest trading session and the partial nationalisation of rival Forbis two weeks ago, ING was seeking to shore up its financial position. 'The market environment has changed over the last two weeks and the expectations for capital levels have changed following massive capital injections in financial institutions worldwide,' ING Chief Executive Michel Tilmant said. 'We have accepted the consequences of this situation and welcome the support of the Dutch state,' he told a news conference, flanked by Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos and central bank president Nout Wellink.ING will issue 10 billion euros worth of securities to the Dutch state, which will have a position similar to common shareholders.The transaction is designed not to dilute shareholder capital.But with a coupon of at least 8.5% and the right to buy back the securities at any time at 150% of the issue price or convert them into ordinary shares, ING will have a strong incentive to pay back the government.
