GORDON BROWN is to set up an emergency committee to take charge of Britain's response to the financial crisis.Reports today claimed it would be modelled on similar lines to Cobra, the Government's crisis management committee, and would bring together ministers, officials and advisers. Its secretariat would be run from the Cabinet Office.The report comes as the US Senate voted to back a revised $700billion (385bn) bail-out package to rescue the nation's battered economy.According to some reports, the Prime Minister is to announce its formation at the same time as a reshuffle to replace Ruth Kelly, the outgoing Transport Secretary.The BBC claimed the limited reshuffle would take place in the next few days, although Downing Street refused to comment on the BBC report.The news of Mr Brown's latest response to the continuing financial turmoil came as it emerged savers in Britain were rushing to put billions of pounds into accounts that guarantee their deposits.Banks that offer 100% guarantees on their customers' savings have seen significant surges in new account openings.And savers are also flocking to banks such as Lloyds TSB and Abbey, which is owned by Spanish giant Santander, as well as to the Treasury-backed National Savings &amp;amp; Investments.The Irish Government's pledge this week that it would guarantee all money saved with an Irish institution for two years is also thought to be causing a flow of money to Irish banks.The pledge covers six institutions - Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Anglo-Irish Bank, Irish Life and Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society and the Educational Building Society.All savings will be guaranteed in their entirety and the move also covers customers at UK branches of Allied Irish Bank, Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.But British banks have challenged the Irish Government over its promise to give 100% protection, suggesting the move was anti-competitive.The protection offered is far more generous than the 35,000 worth of savings protected under current UK legislation.Gordon Brown has promised to increase from 35,000 to 50,000 the amount of a saver's deposits that are protected in British banks.However, the rush of money to new accounts has forced the newly-nationalised Northern Rock to withdraw some of its savings products for new customers in a bid to ensure it does not have an unfair advantage from state ownership.Increasing numbers of consumers looking for safer places for their savings placed Northern in danger of exceeding a 1.5% cap on its share of UK retail deposits.The lender said there had been a 'sizeable' inflow of deposits in recent days.Shares in Halifax Bank of Scotland closed 21% higher yesterday amid hopes a rescue by Lloyds TSB will go ahead.
