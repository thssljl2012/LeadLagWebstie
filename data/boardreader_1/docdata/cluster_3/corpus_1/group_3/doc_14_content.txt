Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HBOS have fallen sharply despite the UK government's rescue package for the three banks. With profits from the banks about to be shared with the government, there has been a mass exodus from the stocks. While the government plan is meant to secure the banks, shareholders have realised they will not be receiving any meaningful dividend. On Monday, HBOS closed down 27.5%, Lloyds TSB was 14.5% lower and RBS down 8.4%. However some financial experts have criticised the government's strategy on saving the banks. They say, in the long run, the competitiveness of Britain's banks will be destroyed and Londons reputation as a financial powerhouse will be ruined.
