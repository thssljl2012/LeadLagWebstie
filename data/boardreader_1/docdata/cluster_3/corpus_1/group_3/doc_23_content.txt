First Minister Alex Salmond's team of economic experts have backed efforts to get the best deal for Scotland from the HBOS takeover.The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) met in Ayrshire to discuss the 12.2 billion takeover by Lloyds TSB. The council, chaired by former Royal Bank of Scotland chief Sir George Mathewson, said the proposed takeover would have a potentially 'significant impact' on the Scottish economy.'The Bank of Scotland represents well over 300 years of banking history,' a joint statement on behalf of the CEA said afterwards.'It is an iconic brand, a cornerstone of the Scottish financial sector. The council therefore supports the alliance that is being led by the Scottish Government to maximise the benefit of the merger and minimise any potential negative impacts to Scotland.'Mr Salmond is preparing to lead a Scottish Government presentation to Lloyds TSB chairman Victor Blank, setting out the advantages Scotland has to offer companies as a business base and centre of expertise in financial services.The statement said there are 'compelling business and competitive arguments' to have key decision-making elements of the merged organisation in Scotland.A summit of business and political leaders in Edinburgh last week, chaired by the First Minister, agreed a 'national statement of concern' over the takeover.Later that week Mr Salmond told Parliament that the Government's objectives included maximising jobs and decision-making functions in Scotland, as well as mitigating any adverse impacts on the economy.The takeover was prompted after a sharp fall in the HBOS share price last month - blamed partly by Mr Salmond on 'spivs and speculators' who participated in the 'short-selling' of HBOS shares.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
