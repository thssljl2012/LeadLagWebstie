 NEW YORK - A few years from now, the world's largest insurer might not be so large.Embattled American International Group Inc., in an effort to become profitable again, appears to be leaning toward shrinking - a similar strategy to that taken by Citigroup Inc., one of the world's biggest banks.'A less complex AIG will be a better competitor,' AIG's new chief executive, Robert Willumstad, said during a conference call yesterday with investors.But Willumstad, a Citi veteran, has yet to reveal any definitive plans. And with the mortgage crisis still far from resolution, investors remain wary about stock in a company that has lost money for three straight quarters and that may have to raise more capital. After revealing a nearly $5.4 billion second-quarter loss late Wednesday, AIG saw its shares plummet 16 percent in trading yesterday.'AIG could not have reported more horrific results,' wrote Bijan Moazami, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey, in a note early yesterday. He downgraded AIG's stock to 'hold' from 'buy.''At this point, we believe that AIG is too big and too complicated for anyone to fully understand and it should be broken up,' Moazami said. 'We will reassess our views on AIG when a strategic plan is unveiled or when the market environment improves.'AIG operates a wide variety of businesses in about 130 countries, ranging from life insurance, auto insurance, property insurance, and mortgage insurance to retirement services, lending, investment services, and airline leasing.Wall Street's calls for a break-up of AIG are not as loud as they were for Citigroup, which was having problems boosting profits even before spiking mortgage defaults triggered the credit crisis last summer.Citigroup is not headed for a break-up now, but rather a paring down; its chief executive said in May that in the next few years, the company - which also has suffered three consecutive quarterly losses - will shed about one-fifth of its assets, including a huge chunk of its mortgage lending operations and investments.Willumstad's review is still incomplete, but he said it will result in 'significant changes.''Our goal is straightforward: to define AIG's vision and determine the optimal portfolio of businesses based on where our true competitive advantages lie,' the CEO said during yesterday's call.He reiterated, though, the company intends to keep International Lease Finance Corp., AIG's airline leasing business, which posted record results in the second quarter.Over the past three quarters, AIG has lost about $25 billion in the value of credit default swaps - or default protection for bondholders - and about $15 billion in other investments.Executives say they believe actual, realized losses will end up being much smaller.But the problem is that AIG - which called its subprime exposure 'minimal' a year ago - is not only joining the likes of Citi and Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. in its mortgage-related assets write-downs. Its other businesses are also weak.AIG's general insurance segment saw a 54.3 percent decline in operating income to $1.39 billion. Income also fell in its life insurance and retirement services division and in its asset management unit.The company said it expects its residential mortgage insurance unit, United Guaranty Corp., to continue to see losses into 2009.
