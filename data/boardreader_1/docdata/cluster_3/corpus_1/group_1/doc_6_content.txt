  By Peter TaylorUBS, Citigroup and Britain's leading high-street banks have been left to step in with close to 200m of funding for Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley after investors all but snubbed the cash call. B&amp;amp;B on Monday will join HBOS and Barclays on the roll of British banks largely ignored after turning to shareholders for crucial injections of capital. Investors are expected to have taken up little more than 20pc of the shares issued under B&amp;amp;B's 400m rights issue, which closed yesterday.The take-up figure is likely to include allocations to leading institutional investors Standard Life, Legal &amp;amp; General, M&amp;amp;G and Insight, who are together sub-underwriting the cash call to the tune of 150m. But analysts said most of the bank's 930,000 retail investors, which account for some 40pc of the existing shares, would have ignored the rights issue.UBS and Citigroup are underwriters, but have sub-underwritten much of the programme to the four institutional shareholders along with six retail banks - Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Abbey.The banks are expected to end up with stakes of at least 3pc each in B&amp;amp;B, with some likely to be left with interests closer to 5pc.The problem-plagued rights issue, which was twice-revised after private equity firm Texas Pacific Group (TPG) entered and then dramatically pulled out of the fund raising programme, closed at 10am yesterday. B&amp;amp;B shares were trading at 55p - just p above the rights issue price - when it closed, and ended the day at 54p. Besieged chairman Rod Kent is likely to call the 20pc acceptance level a success after earlier claiming any take-up rate beyond 8pc would be outstanding.Eight per cent was the take-up rate for the 4bn rights issue carried out by HBOS, which was one of the most disastrous in British history after shares traded as low as 225p - a 50p discount to the rights issue price - days ahead of the closing date. The value of B&amp;amp;B shares collapsed at the same time, hitting a low of 31p.They have traded above 50p recently, despite almost a quarter of the stock being short-sold.Britain's biggest provider of buy-to-let mortgages - a market yet to be tested in a broad economic slowdown - B&amp;amp;B is regarded as highly vulnerable to the downturn.TPG stunned the City when it backed out of a capital raising scheme that would have seen it pay 179m for a 23pc stake in the bank.Mr Kent told the 56 shareholders who attended B&amp;amp;B's extraordinary meeting last month that he was 'surprised and disappointed' by the private equity group's withdrawal.
