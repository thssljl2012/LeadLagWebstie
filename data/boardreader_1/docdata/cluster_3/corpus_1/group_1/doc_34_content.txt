 Sir Fred Goodwin, chief executive of NatWest owner Royal Bank of Scotland is set to come under renewed pressure from investors this week as the bank is forecast to report the biggest-ever loss in UK banking history.Analysts predict that RBS will take another 6bn hit from the credit crunch, driving its first-half loss for the year to as much as 1.7bn.That would be as much as five times the amount Barclays lost in 1992 at the height of the last recession which was the previous record.RBS reports its first-half numbers on Friday and chairman Sir Tom McKillop, alongside Goodwin, is expected to face increased scrutiny when they meet top investors of the following week.The RBS board has already been heavily criticised for its role in the 71bn consortium takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro and the subsequent 12bn rights issue.Analysts say that much of this week's writedowns will come as a result of the ABN deal. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is expected to see a 35% drop in first-half profits to around 2.6bn as tougher economic conditions in the UK combine with global credit crunch pressures.It is forecast to add a further 3bn of writedowns to the 1.7bn which it revealed for the first three months of the year.
