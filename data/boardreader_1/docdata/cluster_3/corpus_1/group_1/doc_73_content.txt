 They say that from a customers point of view, a major drawback of a market economy like ours is that it provides too much choice.Naturally theres a huge choice of examples, from the serried ranks of breakfast cereals and washing powders in the supermarket to the staggering number of beverage variants  I think someone calculated its over 30,000  available from your neighbourhood Starbucks. But in the world of financial services, there are few market sectors which make the point better than direct motor insurance.There was no such thing as direct motor insurance until the mid-80s, when a very clever  and now very rich  man called Peter Wood picked up an obsolete red telephone and put it in the spotlight to act as what we in my trade call a branding icon for his new business, Direct Line.Ever since then, the market has grown and grown and grown, with more and more organisations spending more and more money (close to 400 million a year at the last count) to get their message across.Its not just that there are more organisations. There are more different kinds of organisations. There are the big mainstream players, like Direct Line and Churchill; the bargain-basement firms like Admiral and Elephant; the High Street financial institutions like Halifax and Lloyds TSB; the niche specialists like Sheilas Wheelsand Saga; and the firms in completely different markets who want to get in on the act like Tesco and M&amp;amp;S. And then, of course, in addition, theres the latest major growth sector of the market  the rapid profusion of price comparison sites like GoCompare, Confused.com, Money Supermarket and, yes, its them again, Tesco.And whats really confusing is that apart from the few niche specialists, almost everyone is saying the same thing (low prices) and targeting the same customer (nice ordinary people in nice ordinary cars who stick to the middle of the road in every non-literal sense of the term).Actually, in marketing terms, it isnt just confusing, its very odd. Usually, even in the biggest and most crowded market sectors, those responsible for managing the brands on offer try hard to maintain some kind of differentiation  either in terms of the benefits a product offers, or in terms of the consumer target market, or, more often, both. Drawing on my long-distant experience of the confectionery market, for example, I could bore for Britain on the distinct strategies of the Mars Bar (the bar that thinks its a meal), the Milky Way (the bar that definitely isnt a meal) and the KitKat (the bar thats a break between meals).But in direct insurance, uniquely as far as I can recall, as the market has grown the trend has been in the opposite direction. Brands that did once emphasise some kind of differentiation  like Privilege, for posh people, or Admiral, which claimed to be keen on insuring Londoners  are now at pains to point out that theyre just the same as everyone else.
