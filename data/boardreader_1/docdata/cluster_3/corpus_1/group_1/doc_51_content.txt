 Westpac says there has been a modest rise in loan defaults but it still expects earnings growth of between 6 and 8 per cent, in line with its previous forecasts.In an update to the market, the bank says the number of stressed loans have increased but there are no new writedowns in the third quarter. But Westpac's chief executive Gail Kelly says the bank has weathered the financial storm. 'Westpac has performed through the current cycle largely due to the disciplined risk management that we have in place, the skills and experience of our people,' she said. 'The proposed merger with St George remains on track with implementation planning underway. 'And while the current environment is certainly more challenging than ever, Westpac is well positioned to deal with it.' Westpac says it expects the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates by half a per cent at its board meeting next month. A short time ago, Westpac shares were down 1 per cent to $22.93.
