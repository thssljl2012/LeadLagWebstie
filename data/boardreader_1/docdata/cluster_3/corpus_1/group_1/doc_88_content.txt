 LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss-based miner Xstrata is talking to banks about a $15 billion loan to fund its planned $10 billion hostile bid for South Africa-focused Lonmin, senior banking sources said on Thursday.Xstrata has asked banks for proposals on such a loan, larger than the 5 billion pounds ($9.34 billion) loan originally anticipated, which will refinance Xstrata and Lonmin's existing debt and finance the acquisition, the sources said.Lonmin, the world's third-biggest platinum producer, has rejected Xstrata's planned 33 pounds per share approach as too low and opportunistic.Xstrata has approached 22 banks to make large commitments and give pricing indications on the $15 billion loan, with the aim of putting a club of senior banks together to fund the deal at the top level, they added.Xstrata is asking banks to make large commitments in line with other jumbo loans of up to $1.75 billion each as seen with InBev's $45 billion loan backing its acquisition of Anheuser-Busch on either a sub-underwriting or 'take and hold' basis, several bankers said.Banks are however, proving reluctant to underwrite risk and are finding it difficult to make large commitments given cash constraints and high funding costs, and are opting to make smaller, more clearly defined 'take and hold' commitments of around $1 billion each. 'Take and hold commitments of $1 billion or more are still quite a lot. There will be pressure from the senior banks to launch the deal to a wider syndication,' a banker said. PRICE TALKInitial indications suggest that pricing on Xstrata's loan is likely to be similar to the initial pricing of 175 basis points on InBev's $45 billion loan at 150-175 b.p., bankers said.The loan may face a challenging syndication as it battles for limited liquidity with second round syndications for InBev's loan, a $14 billion loan for BG Group and a 16.1 billion euro ($23.86 billion) loan for Schaeffler.Xstrata's loan could also raise mining sector exposure issues for some banks as BHP Billiton's $55 billion financing backing its bid for Rio Tinto is still on banks' balance sheets. The deal, which was underwritten this year, has yet to fund due to a lack of resolution around the outcome of the bid.Xstrata is however, backed by a strong core of relationship banks and the company has said that it anticipates little problem in securing the financing. Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander have been associated with the loan, among others.The company said that following the proposed acquisition the company's net debt would rise to around $26 billion from $14.8 billion, with gearing rising to two times from 1.37 times.Xstrata also said it expected to retain its investment-grade rating if the acquisition goes through. The company is currently rated BBB+ by S&amp;amp;P and Baa2 by Moody's.(Reporting by Tessa Walsh, additional reporting by Alasdair Reilly; editing by Rory Channing)
