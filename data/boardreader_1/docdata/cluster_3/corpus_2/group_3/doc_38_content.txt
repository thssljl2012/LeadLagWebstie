Still in RBS?   Saw this:      UK Darling:Every Reason To Be Confident Taxpayer Won&amp;#039;t LoseLast  update: 10/13/2008 3:47:57 AMLONDON (Dow Jones)--      The U.K. government doesn&amp;#039;t expect to lose money on its investments  in a number of banks, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling  said Monday. Earlier, the government said it will take stakes  costing a combined GBP37 billion in the Royal Bank of Scotland  (RBS.LN), Lloyds TSB (LLOYD.LN) and HBOS (HBOS.LN). In an interview  with the BBC, Darling said he expects the government to have a  stake of 60% in RBS, for which it will pay GBP0.655 a share, and a  stake of 40% in the merged Lloyds and HBOS. The government will  borrow the GBP37 billion through the sale of gilts and Treasury  bills starting the week of Oct. 20. But Darling said borrowing to  buy stakes in the banks was an investment, in contrast to borrowing  to pay public sector salaries or for defense. &amp;quot;We are taking an  investment in two banks that are worth a great deal,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;quot;There is every reason to be confident that the British taxpayer  will get the money back.&amp;quot; Darling said the banks will be run on a  commercial basis, with the government taking no day-to-day role in  management. But he wouldn&amp;#039;t say how long he expected the government  to keep its stakes. &amp;quot;We will do whatever it takes for as long as it  takes,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But I don&amp;#039;t think governments can run banks for  very long.&amp;quot; -By Paul Hannon, Dow Jones Newswires, +44 20 7842 9491,  paul.hannon@dowjones.com
