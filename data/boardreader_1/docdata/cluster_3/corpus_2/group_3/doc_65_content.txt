         The only odd thing is that the inflation from 81.6 to 217.2 is an increase equivalent to 100 to 266 but the current price last Friday was 267.6. only a bit more, but that may be because I should have used a date eight months back as maturity values are on that basis.  Re Lloyds, I&amp;#039;ve been looking at the Lloyds TMF board which is full of angry private shareholders. We don&amp;#039;t want to merge with HBOS, a basket case. It must have been forced on Lloyds.  Without the merger Lloyds could have done the same as Barclays and said No to the Gov onerous conditions and raised money by a share issue and seen a price rise today instead of a massive price fall.  We assume that institutional shareholders who also own HBOS want the merger to stop them losing even more holding HBOS (what&amp;#039;s left of it).
