  quote:   THE government will tomorrow launch the biggest rescue of Britains high-street banks when the UKs four biggest institutions ask for a 35 billion financial lifeline.  The unprecedented move will make the government the biggest shareholder in at least two banks. The Royal Bank of Scot-land (RBS), which has seen its market value fall to under 12 billion, is to ask the government to underwrite a 15 billion cash call. HBOS, which is Britains biggest provider of mortgages, is requesting up to 10 billion. Lloyds TSB, which is in the process of acquiring HBOS, and Barclays require 7 billion and 3 billion. ... The British bank rescue could leave the government owning 70% of HBOS and 50% of RBS. ... Further capital is also available and the Treasury has increased the total amount to 75 billion.      The nationalization begins.
