 Guess we may not get to step 12 right away?       http://www.reuters.com/article/topNe...dChannel=10338            Quote:                         Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Barclays were in line to receive the billions of pounds from investors and taxpayers in a bid to rescue them from the impact of the global credit crisis, said the sources, declining to be named.      Media reports said Barclays was trying to raise cash from private investors rather than the government, but that the other three were expected to tap into a huge cash-pile made available by the government.      The move could result in the government becoming the biggest shareholder, and even a majority investor, in Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS -- effectively partly nationalizing two of Britain&amp;#039;s biggest banks.      Talks among the banks, government officials and regulators were due to go on through the early hours of Monday to determine how much each would need from the 50 billion pounds offered by the government last week to offset the global credit crunch.      An announcement was expected before markets open on Monday, but details were still being fine-tuned, said the sources.
