          they grovelled so much at last night&amp;#039;s meeting.    Apparently not so according to Robert Peston&amp;#039;s blog last night: the banks were asking for Darling to get off the fence. However the reportage of the meeting sent out a different picture which spooked the markets this morning. Hence this evening&amp;#039;s panic, the result of which we will see tomorrow.   http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/     last night a trio of the UK&amp;#039;s biggest banks - Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, and Lloyds TSB - signalled to Alistair Darling that they&amp;#039;d like to see the colour of taxpayers&amp;#039; money rather quicker than he might have expected.  According to bankers, these three were disappointed that at a private meeting last night with Darling, held at his request, he didn&amp;#039;t present to them a fully elaborated banking rescue plan.  One banker told me that what he called the Gang of Three of Barclays, RBS and Lloyds TSB told Darling to pull his finger out and finalise whatever it is he&amp;#039;s eventually prepared to offer on taxpayers&amp;#039; behalf.  On paper, Lloyds TSB, RBS and Barclays don&amp;#039;t have a pressing need for additional capital.  But they have become concerned that they are being weakened significantly by investors&amp;#039; perception that they are short of capital and their balance sheets need to be strengthened.
