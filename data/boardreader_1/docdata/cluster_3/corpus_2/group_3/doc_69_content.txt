          ... meanwhile at 11am in London... Barclays -5.2% HBOS -14% Lloyds -10.2% RBS - 27.35% This is on top of the largest fall in the FTSE&amp;#039;s history yesterday.   So what, even if it followed what was  NOT  the largest % fall in the FTSE yesterday (see way back in October 1987). In a society linked to capitalist ideals that is what happens to shares - they do go down as well as up (or have you forgotten your FSA lesson in MARKET ECONOMICS COURSE 101?)
