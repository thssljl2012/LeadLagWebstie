         Surely by selling now you fall victim to the trap that most private investors fall into, namely that they buy high and sell low. I think in all honesty the big four banks (HSBC, Lloyds TSB, RBS and Barclays) will be the survivors from this, and whilst it may take time, their profits and share price will recover.  Whilst I&amp;#039;m not suggesting this will be any time soon, if you&amp;#039;re prepared to sit back and enjoy the dividends for the next 3-5 years then your patience will be rewarded.  Remember that true stock market wealth is gained over time and short termism is what kills investors profits.
