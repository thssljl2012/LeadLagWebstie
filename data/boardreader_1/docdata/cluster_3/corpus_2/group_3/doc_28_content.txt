Investors shares will be worth nothing.       http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/f...ke-in-RBS.html                       Mega political problems there. Bank shares were regarded as safe , had decent dividends, did better than most after the 2000-2003 crash and feature heavily in pensions, pension plans  and people&amp;#039;s savings and in bank worker&amp;#039;s company share plans. They would still look viable in a recession at their old prices, dividend rates, price earning ratios  and interest cover. They looked safe and were sold as such.  There&amp;#039;s an awful lot of angry people there if you do a Ralitrack on them.      The problem is their value and ability to lend has been driven down by the share price crash (its a viscious circle) and they  can&amp;#039;t raise more capital to increase it or borrow -  more than that they have bad debts. If the problem is really that the trillions and trillions of dubious financial instruments really matter there is no answer other than governments promising to pay of all that debt too - in about 5000 million years time....
