           The Government is expected to invest 12bn in RBS, 10bn in HBOS, 7bn in Lloyds TSB and 3bn in Barclays, following request for the emergency funding from the banks.    Game On indeed!  Could this mark the turning point in this banking crisis and return to less emotional trading based on the future prospects of a company. Lets hope so.
