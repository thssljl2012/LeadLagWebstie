         Can I opt out?   http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sect...   THE government will tomorrow launch the biggest rescue of Britains high-street banks when the UKs four biggest institutions ask for a 35 billion financial lifeline.   The unprecedented move will make the government the biggest shareholder in at least two banks. The Royal Bank of Scot-land (RBS), which has seen its market value fall to under 12 billion, is to ask the government to underwrite a 15 billion cash call. HBOS, which is Britains biggest provider of mortgages, is requesting up to 10 billion. Lloyds TSB, which is in the process of acquiring HBOS, and Barclays require 7 billion and 3 billion.   The scale of the fundraising could lead to trading at the London stock market being suspended.
