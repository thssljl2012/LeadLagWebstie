          I say again, equity investors can decide whether or not they want to keep funding a business through secondary offerings etc but this is not the same as shorters deciding to fundamentally cripple a business for their own ends. In the former example, the only loser is the silly investor whereas in the latter it is the business itself. This is the asymmetry.    I&amp;#039;ve still yet to see an example of where this has actually happened. It&amp;#039;s quite clear that with RBS they were &amp;amp;quot;crippled&amp;amp;quot; by a management team that encouraged excessive risk taking.  It would have been impossible for the &amp;amp;quot;shorters&amp;amp;quot; to have been responsible because it is widely acknowledged that there was actually very little shorting activity in RBS (and the other banks).  Eg:   Data reveal short sellers not to blame for UK bank falls   Short sellers could not have been to blame for the share price falls in UK banks, according to data just published, as consultants warn the shorting freeze imposed by the Financial Services Authority has damaged market confidence. ... The levels of stock borrowing of other UK banks was also in single digits. At Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley, it was 6.8% of the shares available to be lent; at Alliance &amp;amp;amp; Leicester, it was 6.8%; Standard Chartered, 2.3%; Lloyds TSB, 3.1%; Barclays, 4.5%; HSBC, 2.8%; and at  RBS, 1.2% .   see:  www.wealth-bulletin.com/archive/tag/HBOS/content/2451947961   It is a myth that shorters cripple companies, the real culprits are incompetent management teams.
