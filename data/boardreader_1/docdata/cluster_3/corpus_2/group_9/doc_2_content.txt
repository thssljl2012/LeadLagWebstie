Rule book on Monopolies completely shredded up then.        Santander must almost be too big to allowed to buy this..im sure they will be blocked.  Or private equity firms....WTF       Surely they will just use it to run up huge debts like their business model, operate on a shoe string and therefore reduce tax liability...
