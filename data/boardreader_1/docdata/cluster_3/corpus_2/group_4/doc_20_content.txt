          but isn&amp;#039;t it also likely to have been for a higher capital amount, more than the 7bn they are raising now? That&amp;#039;s why they can argue the Gulf money is cheaper overall than what was on offer from the gov.   Barclays, and the other banks, were told how much they needed to raise by the year end. Whilst they now have until the end of March? the options for these capital raisings were the government or &amp;#039;investors&amp;#039; or a combination of the two.    Irrespective of the cost of this exercise the point now is that the majority of existing shareholders will see their investment greatly diluted. A select band of &amp;#039;johnny come lately&amp;#039; investors are to an extent being allowed to offset their current paper losses by providing the necessary additional capital. As a long term shareholder I have subscribed to all previous rights issues including the one in the early 90s? where the money was immediately lent out and lost in the last property market crash.   So I am a bit peeved that I am not being given the opportunity to subscribe on the same terms as the select investors. Yes I can buy more shares in the market but why shold I have to pay additional commission and stamp duty just to stand still.
