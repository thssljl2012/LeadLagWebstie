          So I am a bit peeved that I am not being given the opportunity to subscribe on the same terms as the select investors. Yes I can buy more shares in the market but why shold I have to pay additional commission and stamp duty just to stand still.   As can be seen from the following table     Bank           Offer Price        Current SP ====           ===========        ==========  Lloyds         173.30             168.10                           HBOS           113.60              95.00                 RBS             65.50              56.00        the current share prices of Lloyds, HBOS and RBS are all sufficiently lower than the offer price as to make it cheaper to buy additional shares on the open market even with stamp duty and commission charges.  If Barclays had taken the Government money rather than going to the Middle East investors I think it quite likely Barclay&amp;#039;s share price would like the others be trading at a discount to the offer price. Unfortunately I can&amp;#039;t remember seeing what price the Middle East investors are paying for ordinary shares but given the recent falls in Barclays SP I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if you could purchase them cheaper on the open market even with stamp duty etc.  Dave
