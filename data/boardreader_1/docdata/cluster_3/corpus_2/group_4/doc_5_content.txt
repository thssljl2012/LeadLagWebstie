          The bank has struck deals with the Qatar Investment Authority and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to strengthen its capital position, as demands grow for leading banks to cushion themselves against a protracted recession. Barclays plans to sell 5.8bn to the Middle Eastern investors and 1.5bn to other shareholders.  ... The fundraising will help Barclays avoid the shackles placed on rivals such as HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland, which have accessed the bail-out plan. Gordon Brown has ordered banks to take advantage of a 40 billion cash pot from the European Union to help small businesses through the economic crisis.   So far the major high street banks have taken up just 10bn     http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcr...   The story is not fully out yet, but in summary... the UK government is bailing out banks... the government is forcing some of the weaker ones to take UK/EU money (with all of it&amp;#039;s rules and stipulations). Barclays refused to take cash on these stipulations, in fact the chairman of Barclays got down on his knees (literally) before Brown and begged not to have to take this UK/EU funding (and hence state control).  Now as an altenative to Brown, they have sold 1/3rd of their share-cap to Qatar/Abu-Dhabi.  There goes another slab of a British company, to foreign ownership. I think New Labour cruising in throwing down the diktats for how banks must run some form of socialist banking coopertive did no favours, as evidenced by those with a choice, tieing up elsewhere.  Any other views?
