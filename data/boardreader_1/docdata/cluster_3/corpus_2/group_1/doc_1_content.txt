         From Times Online August 7, 2008  Barclays&amp;#039; profits drop a third  by Patrick Hosking  John Varley, chief executive of Barclays, today posted what he called an &amp;amp;quot;acutely disappointing&amp;amp;quot; 33 per cent slide in first half profits to 2.8 billion and apologised for the collapse in the bank&amp;#039;s share price.   &amp;amp;quot;Our shareholders have had to endure a lot,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Varley said, and gave warning that it would take a long time for the business volumes enjoyed before the credit crunch hit to be achieved once again.   Total bad debts for the six months to June came in at 2.4 billion, a 155 per cent increase on the same period in 2007. The investment bank, Barclays Capital, posted net credit losses of 2 billion, sending its profits diving from 1.7 billion last time to 524 million.   Barclays Global Investors, the fund management arm, was also hit by the decline in world stockmarkets, recording a 32 per cent fall in profit to 265 million.   However, other parts of the bank proved more resilient, with Barclaycard, the credit card division, putting in the best performance with a 30 per cent increase in profit to 388 million.   As previously promised, Barclays held the interim dividend at 11.5p. Last month the bank raised 4.5 billion in a placing and open offer to shore up its weakened balance sheet.
