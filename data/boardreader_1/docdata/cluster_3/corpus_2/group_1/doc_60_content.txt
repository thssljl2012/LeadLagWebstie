 Been looking into it,  Barclays seem relatively ok, 12 a trade, 30 to managed a stocks and shares ISA to stick them in and some relatively decent tools and info.      Just wondering what other people use, is there a better site. I&amp;#039;ve checked a couple of other banks but not been to impressed and a few other sites with prices that didn&amp;#039;t seem great.      Also, anyone know of any particularly good sites with, info on stocks and shares trading,  a decent site with business info, i guess other sites that are in the similar vain to the Financial times type content and so on.      Its yet another subject where, theres just to many sites to look though and too much information so if anyones got any recommendations it could help.
