Performance Highlights  &amp;#039;In the difficult environment of the first half of 2008, Barclays remained solidly profitable, albeit at levels below the record performance achieved last year. We were helped by the earnings diversification that we have created across the Group and by our improved ability to flex both costs and balance sheet. This enabled us to absorb the cost of the credit market dislocation while seeking opportunities in areas of long term growth.&amp;#039; John Varley, Group Chief Executive  Income in line with record prior year despite challenging conditions Costs decreased 3%, leading to a two percentage point improvement in the cost:income ratio  Group profit before tax of 2.75bn, reflecting lower profits from Investment Banking and Investment Management as a consequence of the credit market dislocation and an increased contribution from Global Retail and Commercial Banking:  Improved profitability, tight cost control and strong mortgage book growth in UK Retail Banking  Stable performance in Barclays Commercial Bank, consistent with cautious lending approach  Very strong profit growth at Barclaycard with good progress both internationally and in the UK  Accelerated investment in Barclays international retail and commercial banking network reflected in very strong income growth  Barclays Capital profitable after a further 1bn of net losses in the second quarter due to credit market dislocation, in addition to the 1bn already announced in the first quarter; costs and credit market exposures significantly reduced  Solid income growth at Barclays Global Investors and selective support for liquidity products  Broadly based income growth in Barclays Wealth  Capital ratios strengthened following July equity issuance: Pro forma  Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.1% and Equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.3%   Interim cash dividend maintained at 11.5p      They seem OK.   Certainly they have done enough for me to say:-  &amp;amp;quot;There is no more reason to worry about this share in my portfo;io&amp;amp;quot;.     Glas.
