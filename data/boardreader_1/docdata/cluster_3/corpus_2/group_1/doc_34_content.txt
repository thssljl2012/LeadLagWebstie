Half of that 22%+ is disappearing now in the adjustment cycle and now re-aligning hopefully into new industry and thats when sustainability will come for the economy with that 2.5% growth.                      i didnt mean structurally, i just meant right now. In both the US and the UK the banks are in an absolute mess having made massive massive losses over the last year, they&amp;#039;re in far worse condition than ours - Irish banks, for all the bad sentiment surrounding them, have actually steered almost 100% clear of the whole subprime, CDO, CLO SIV, conduits etc. RBS, HBOS, Citi, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Bradford and Bingley, Barclays, Wachovia etc etc have all had to raise fresh capital to keep their balance sheets afloat, never mind Bear Stearns and Northern Rock - Irish banks haven&amp;#039;t and won&amp;#039;t this year touch their shareholders looking for capital. The worst thing to happen to the Irish banks last year was a couple of solicitors fleecing them for a few quid. Couple this with inflation running amok and currencies more fitting of toilet paper in both countries and you have the receipe for serious long term problems in the US and UK.
