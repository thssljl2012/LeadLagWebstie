 Linda even the big names come unstuck................Todays Times      THE Royal Bank of Scotland is poised to unveil the biggest loss in UK banking history after taking a hit of almost 6 billion from the credit crisis.      Britains second-largest bank is this week expected to reveal a pre-tax loss of at least 1 billion for the first six months of the year, with analysts warning it could slide to as much as 1.7 billion in the red.      The loss would be roughly five times higher than the deficit racked up by Barclays in 1992 at the height of the last recession.      RBS chairman Sir Tom McKillop is already under pressure from investors after the banks recent 12 billion rights issue. His chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, who marks 10 years at the bank this weekend, also faces shareholder scrutiny.
