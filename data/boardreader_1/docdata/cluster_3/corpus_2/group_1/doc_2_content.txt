Any reason you can&amp;#039;t set up a ScotiaBank account just for travelling - as the previous poster says - it saves you the $5.00 fee if you use Barclays, Deutsche and BNP Paribas in Europe.  As well as Bank of America, Westpac (Australia)and possible ABSA in South Africa - although this may be just for Westpac customers.
