Yep, I think it&amp;#039;s just the retail version of Barclays Capital from what I can tell, operated by Barclays Stockbrokers.    The idea was good and you can see what kind of clients they&amp;#039;re targetting but I think they&amp;#039;re relying too much on their branding to bring in the business. Spreads aren&amp;#039;t great, not the worst but not the best, but pricing does seem fair when compared to 3000 Xtra.    Time will tell but I feel comfortable with them so far...    You&amp;#039;re on FXi, right?    edit: Yes just spot, and no Level 2    Also 100k min and 3m max so they&amp;#039;re middle of the road. Enough for me but minimum may be too much for small traders and maximum would probably be too small for large traders. I&amp;#039;m not sure who developed the package but in my opinion it needs reviewing if they expect to entice customers away from what&amp;#039;s on offer already.
