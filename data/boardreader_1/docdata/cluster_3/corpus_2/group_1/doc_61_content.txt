       Fannie, Freddie Fall on Likely Need for a Bailout    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;amp;sid=ahRjVXxNFU6Q&amp;amp;amp;refer=home    Aug. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac tumbled to about 18-year lows in New York trading on concern the government will be forced to bail out the mortgage-finance companies, wiping out common stockholders.   Fannie and Freddie each fell as much as 19 percent after Barron&amp;#039;s said the Bush administration anticipates the government- chartered companies will fail to raise the equity capital they need, prompting the U.S. Treasury to step in. Fannie is down 84 percent this year. Freddie has fallen 86 percent.   ``It is very, very likely to happen before the end of the third quarter,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Ajay Rajadhyaksha, the head of fixed income strategy for Barclays Capital Inc., said in an interview. ``Without government help, we think there is very little chance of Freddie completing a significant capital raising.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;   The government plans to recapitalize Fannie and Freddie with taxpayer money should their capital raising fail, Barron&amp;#039;s said, citing a person in the Bush administration it didn&amp;#039;t identify. A rescue of the companies, which own or guarantee 42 percent of the $12 trillion in U.S. home loans, would include preferred stock with a seniority, dividend preference and convertibility that would wipe out common stockholders, Barron&amp;#039;s reported.   Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who on July 31 received the unprecedented authority he requested from Congress to help the companies if needed, has said a bailout won&amp;#039;t be necessary.   ``We aren&amp;#039;t going to comment on speculation,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said a Treasury spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli. ``As the Secretary has said, we have no plans to use these authorities.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;   Fannie Mae was down $1.40, or 18 percent, to $6.51, at 1:40 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Freddie fell 93 cents, or 16 percent, to $4.92.   Housing Slump   ``The Barron&amp;#039;s article significantly overstates our financial situation,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Sharon McHale, a spokeswoman for McLean, Virginia-based Freddie. She said the company is ``adequately capitalized&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and believes ``we will get through the current housing market crisis.&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Brian Faith, a spokesman for Washington-based Fannie wouldn&amp;#039;t comment immediately.   The companies have been battered by record delinquencies and rising losses amid the worst housing slump since the Great Depression, posting four straight losses totaling $14.9 billion. Both cut their dividends this month and announced plans to slow growth after bigger-than-expected losses for the second quarter.   Freddie Chief Executive Officer Richard Syron said on Aug. 6 that the U.S. housing market is still ``searching for a bottom&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and that most of the company&amp;#039;s expected losses have yet to be realized. The U.S. mortgage delinquency rate has set a record every quarter since March 2007 while the rate of late payers going into foreclosure is also at an all-time high, Freddie said.   Raising Capital   Fannie was created as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt&amp;#039;s New Deal in the 1930s, a time when the U.S. economy was struggling to emerge from a stock market crash, industrial production had tumbled 50 percent and the unemployment rate reached 30 percent. Freddie was started in 1970 primarily as competition for Fannie.   Fannie has raised $14.4 billion in new capital since last December to offset credit losses. Freddie, which sold $6 billion in preferred stock in November, is struggling to raise $5.5 billion more that that company said in May it planned to sell.   Syron said on Aug. 6 Freddie would have to pay ``double- digit&amp;#039;&amp;#039; rates to issue preferred stock, compared to the 8.75 percent Fannie paid for its preferred stock issue in May. The task is made even more difficult now that Freddie&amp;#039;s market value has dropped to about $3 billion from $42 billion a year ago.   ``If they&amp;#039;re unable to tap the markets to raise capital, I think we&amp;#039;re talking a matter of quarters before the government has to step in,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Joshua Rosner, an analyst with independent research firm Graham Fisher &amp;amp;amp; Co. in New York, said in an interview this month.   Puling Market Down   Both companies will need to raise as much as $15 billion, Paul Miller, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp;amp;amp; Co. in Arlington, Virginia, said earlier this month.   Fannie paid a record high yield in a $3.5 billion sale of three-year benchmark notes last week that drew less demand from Asia, the second-biggest buyer of Fannie&amp;#039;s debt and mortgage- backed securities. Asian investors bought 22 percent of the issue, almost half the demand of three months ago and about two- thirds of Asia&amp;#039;s usual buying.   Treasury data show that private and government investors in Japan slowed purchases of their debt to $770 million in June, from $4.5 billion a month earlier. China bought $9.6 billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt, down from $14.9 billion in May.
