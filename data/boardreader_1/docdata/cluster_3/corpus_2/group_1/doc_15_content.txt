 Hi all      The CBA cut all its fixed home/investment rates about a week ago by 0.25%after (from memory) ANZ cut its fixed rates.      Go onto their website under $ Rates, fees &amp;amp;amp; charges then half way down click Home Loans then Complete. About a week ago their 1 year fixed was 9.60% and the 15 year was 9.30%.       Having said that they had jacked them up a lot in the previous 6 months.      Hopefully there is more drops to come in the next few weeks/months.      Flipper
