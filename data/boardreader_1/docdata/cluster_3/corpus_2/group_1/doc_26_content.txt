There are some guaranteed options available with certain providers.     The investment bond must not be sold with that purpose in mind. It needs to be documented as chosen for another reason. Otherwise it fails the means test requirements. If it is chosen for investment purposes such as tax efficiency, lower cost etc then if local authority care is required then it will be exempt from the means test.     All that said, going to a bank for financial advice is the most expensive way to get advice and typically you end up seeing someone with lower experience and lower qualifications. Banks are the natural training ground for new advisers nowadays. They operate on a sales force basis and that is not the environment ot seek proper financial advice. As reflected by complaints stats where banks account for the majority of all complaints going to the FOS.                         Thank you very much for this detailed post, I feel a lot better informed now. I totally agree with your comment about banks (and I particularly dislike Barclays) but I can only advise my MIL in this instance. I am concerned that Barclays have clearly tried to persuade her to take out a product that she doesn&amp;#039;t need.     Thank you again.  CelticStar
