The underwriters and sub-underwriters had to pick up most of the tab.  Hardly a successful rights issue.    From ft.com:     http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a9e5521a-6...0779fd18c.html      Bradford and Bingley&amp;#039;s  rights issue has been largely shunned by its shareholders with investors taking up only 20 to 30 per cent of the shares offered in the 400m rights issue.  ..    However, the issue is heavily sub-underwritten. The UKs biggest banks including Lloyds TSB, HBOS, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays are on the hook to sub-underwrite about 120m.     Four large investors, Standard Life, Legal &amp;amp;amp; General, M&amp;amp;amp;G and Insight, are to sub-underwrite about 145m of the issue.   ..   B&amp;amp;amp;Bs rights issue has attracted a lot of adverse publicity. The buy to let lender has been forced to restructure it twice  following a shock profit warning and for a second time after private equity group TPG withdrew its support in July.         Let&amp;#039;s face it -  every  major bank will be &amp;#039;successful&amp;#039; in raising money because the government will make sure they get the cash they need
