    AIG May Report Quarterly Profit     Plunge     on Writedowns        Aug. 6 (Bloomberg) --   American International Group Inc.  , the world&amp;#039;s biggest insurer, may post second-quarter results that are close to break-even after writedowns tied to the U.S. housing slump cut into earnings from insurance.      AIG probably will say later today that net income fell   97 percent   to $148.9 million, according to the average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The New York-based company has been battered by losses from contracts sold to protect fixed- income investors amid the subprime mortgage market collapse.       http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2...&amp;amp;amp;refer=finance
