         Started a group to try and get shareholders to let Barclays management know that we don&amp;#039;t want bits and pieces of our company sold off at rock-bottom prices, and they should preserve capital instead. Do consider joining...   http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=42980557664   I&amp;#039;m not sure what kind of difference my email might make, since I&amp;#039;m just a small investor in a very large pond, but I believe in strong future for the bank.  These are hard times, and hard times call for hard decisions, and it takes courage and conviction to weather them. I find it distressing then that Barclays has decided on a business as usual approach as far as dividends and capital preservation go.  As an investor, and I think I speak for many of us, I would not be upset if the dividend was cut to retain earning and beef up the balance sheet, or if you paid my dividend in shares.  Yes it would hurt to receive less cash, but it would hurt me even more if the very institution that generated it were to weaken. The last thing we want to see is further dilution of equity at these low prices to opportunistic investors. Save the cash, and we&amp;#039;ll take the hit in the near-term if it means a stronger Barclays in the future.
