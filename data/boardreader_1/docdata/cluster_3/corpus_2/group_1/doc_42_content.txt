         From the same Timesonline article:  &amp;amp;quot; Alex Potter, analyst at Collins Stewart, said that Lloyds TSB&amp;#039;s capital base was still appropriate for the bank&amp;#039;s defensive balance sheet, particularly given that some of the impairments announced yesterday were temporary. &amp;amp;quot;  Just for balance.
