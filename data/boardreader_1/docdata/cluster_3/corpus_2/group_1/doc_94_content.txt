Small banks that are over exposed to the mortgage market are suffering, Rock went bust due to a run on it, what you&amp;#039;re saying resembles reality less and less.      What is your vested interest, I&amp;#039;m sure you have one, so you may as well explain.                      Barclays         Nawtest         Bradford and Bingley      Northern Rock      Who else? Surely you know.      Frankie and Bennies (or is it Freddie and Mackies) - the biggest mortgage lender in the world.........finito&amp;#039;d just a few months ago.      Wimperies - only 1.5 billion loss - called in Rothschild things are so good, they&amp;#039;re gonna have a party they are.      Dixons to close hundreds of stores      5000 Estate agents gone bust this year so far....more to come...      Airlines going bust      Persimmons in deep doodoo      Even Amtrak are in receivership      I could go on, but won&amp;#039;t, as clearly the economic stability in the world is solid as a rock. Northern Rock...boom boom.       Anyone associated with MORTGAGES.....hsbc have not been as stupid as other banks...      You&amp;#039;re right, and those banks who check customers details, and don&amp;#039;t give &amp;#039;liar loans&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;self certififcation loans&amp;#039; are those I bank with, at least they&amp;#039;re safe.
