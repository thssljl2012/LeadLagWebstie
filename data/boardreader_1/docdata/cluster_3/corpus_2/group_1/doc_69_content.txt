    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Asia&amp;#039;s tigers will roar once again   G&amp;amp;M    Saturday, August 30, 2008  Asia&amp;#039;s tigers will roar once again        DAVID BERMAN        When a value investor sees any investment fall well below its euphoric peak, a light bulb turns on: Is this thing a buy?    In the case of China, the Shanghai stock exchange composite index has been falling so sharply since hitting a peak in October that the question arises nearly every day. As of yesterday, the index was down more than 60 per cent from its high, making it the world&amp;#039;s biggest stinker.     Of course, the decline was no surprise to observers who followed the investing mania there last year. Just about everyone was scrambling to open a trading account, and some investors were selecting stocks based on lucky numbers. Clearly, this was an unsustainable boom.    But the severe decline has lopped off the parabolic spike of the past two years, bringing down the index to a more reasonable level. Indeed, it has risen by a total of just 20 per cent since the start of the decade, a period during which China&amp;#039;s gross domestic product has grown by an amazing 150 per cent.     What&amp;#039;s also interesting is that China is not alone in this stock market mayhem: Indexes in India, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan have also fallen sharply, suggesting that the downturn is not due to domestic issues alone.     &amp;quot;Asian equities looked very expensive back in October,&amp;quot; Niall MacLeod, a strategist at UBS, said in a note to clients. &amp;quot;Now, however, they are within a whisker of valuation levels that have historically resulted in good returns over the next six months.&amp;quot;    Chinese stocks now trade at 16 times 2007 earnings - not bad, given that corporate earnings are expected to rise 30 per cent this year. South Korean stocks, among the cheapest of the bunch, trade at just 9.7 times earnings.    No one is suggesting that the volatility is over. Mr. MacLeod noted that Asian equities have a habit of continuing to fall even after entering &amp;quot;buy zone&amp;quot; valuation levels. In other words, they tend to overshoot on the downside.     But if you have a reasonable time horizon - say, more than six months - investing in an exchange-traded fund that tracks Asian stocks or the Chinese market in particular is beginning to look like a good bet: According to Mr. MacLeod, Asian equities have historically risen 11 per cent six months after entering the &amp;quot;buy zone.&amp;quot;    Fortunately, investing is a snap with the help of exchange-traded funds. Barclays offers the iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25, which gives exposure to large Chinese firms, and the iShares FTSE China (HK Listed) index fund, which gives a wide exposure to stocks listed in Hong Kong.     If you prefer to bet on the entire region, Barclays also offers the unwieldy sounding iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan index fund, in which China is the giant. One day, it will also be the world&amp;#039;s giant.
