So what will drive gte sp, price of crude or the fundamentals of gte exploration success ?    I think the details of institutions/ mutual fund investments as at end of June 30 2008 is pretty enlightening. I would surmise majority of these positions were initiated in June &amp;#039;08. Trading volumes in the last 2 weeks in june was particulary heavy ( 12m day/ several 4.5m days) on the AMEX when the sp set the year high $8.70+-.Institutions &amp;amp; Mutual funds such as U.S Global, Barclays Global, State Street, Hartford Inv., just to name a few, were actively initiating positions. Yet the crude at this juncture had not spiked to the mid $140s I would estimate their avg sp lies in the $6.50 to $7 range. I would say these these investors are forward looking and they like, very much, gte&amp;#039;s prospects. Furthermore with their longer term investment horizons than the retail contingent I would expect them, and the dozens of lesser holdings such as Putnam, JP Morgan, Stanley Morgan, Deutsche Asset, Invesco etc, to add as the additional data on Costy 1-5 unfolds.  I predict a $7 sp in the very short term as the future prospects/ fundamentals, attractive risk/ reward, will out weigh wti gyrations regardless of the returns of the bulls.
