A   kitchen assistant working 40 hours a week on the national minimum wage   of 11,481 would take a 72.5% drop in income.         I also suspect that the downturn and credit crunch will affect a   greater percentage of bankers than kitchen assistants.       And this is right and proper, since the credit crunch is entirely   the result of a load of greedy bankers doing something which a child   of six could see was stupid.      I don&amp;#039;t agree. The credit crunch is &amp;amp;quot;entirely&amp;amp;quot; the result of a load of  foolish people buying property on microscopic (or even negative!)  margin which even a child of six could see was stupidly risky.    Except, of course, I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s as simple as that. Lloyds bank  didn&amp;#039;t particularly get involved in the more risky and esoteric bits  of mortgage finance and lending. In 97 its share price was around 800.  It&amp;#039;s now 300. Barclays share price was around 400, it&amp;#039;s now 350. Even  UBS isn&amp;#039;t (yet) seeing the 10 year declines that Lloyds has. Some  people have made huge amounts of money backing Barclays and UBS that  they would have failed to do with Lloyds.    The people wanted credit, and the banks shareholders (also the people)  wanted them to have it. If the government (representing the people)  wanted to make all the banks behave like Lloyds, they could have  passed laws but the people would then have objected that they couldn&amp;#039;t  get onto the property ladder because they couldn&amp;#039;t get mortgages on  terms like the banks were offering to people in the US etc and the  shareholders would have objected and sold UK banks and bought US  banks. So the people would have voted the government out and installed  another one that would have done what the people wanted at the time.    Tim.
