 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U...es_metropolitan_area   Based on the 2005 census, the top 20 MAs have a population of 115M which is nearly 40% of the entire country. I would not consider 40% a &amp;quot;limited&amp;quot; sample size.  As for not being able to find the raw data itself, well that&amp;#039;s how S&amp;amp;P, MSCI, Dow Jones, FTSE, etc. make money. My brother-in-law works at Barclays and he says they pay a pretty penny to get this data. It&amp;#039;s very unlikely you can just browse on their public sites and get anything more than recent summary numbers.
