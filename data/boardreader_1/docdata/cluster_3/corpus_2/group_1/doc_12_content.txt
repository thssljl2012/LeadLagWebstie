 City of London   225m   48 fl   Demo + U/C (delayed) - Page 119 - SkyscraperCity       Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  the spliff fairy                         argh thats what I mean. 28 months imo is waaaay too long, especially given the volatility of any given market. Seriously what do they do (genuine question) in that time to justify such slow processes?      We&amp;#039;re the financial capital of the world dammit. Youd have thought more than one skyscraper would have gone up 2003-2012 of the 40 planned. Every year NYC, Tokyo and Chicago, our main competitors for the title, open new skyscrapers added onto their skylines, and I needn&amp;#039;t even mention the other end of the spectrum, Shanghai or Dubai (Shanghai added nearly 2000 buildings over 140m in 5 years). I understand much in Asia is completely different in outlook and circumstance, but at  least  more than one or two for London would be normal? argh....                      Have you any idea how many millions sq ft of offices have been built since 2000 &amp;amp;amp; is being built now? London is predominately low-mid rise has been for a long time. Numerous skyscrapers have been built  in London since then.CW alone has seen HSBC/Citi, Barclays &amp;amp;amp; the Bank St towers with Swiss Re, 201 BG &amp;amp;amp; Willis following in the city.       How many have been built in cities such as Paris, Frankfurt &amp;amp;amp; Sydney in that time. Answer not a lot. Even with the delay on this it should still be built or U/C by 2012 with the possibility of LBT, Pinnacle Heron , RS and 20FC. They are still continuing with sub structure works so when they do decided to continue with construction it will go up very fast.       Last July there was a fear that none of these towers would get built/get funded as there was supposed to be a massive over supply of offices by 2010 &amp;amp;amp; developers were falling over themselves to schemes started as a lot of schemes got pre-lets. Current circumstances show a lot can happen in a year &amp;amp;amp; I would imagine a lot of developments will be getting dusted down in a year or two.
