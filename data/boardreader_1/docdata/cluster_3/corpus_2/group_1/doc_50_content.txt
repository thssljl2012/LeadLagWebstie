If your NCD haven&amp;#039;t reach 50% and you have no claim for the current coverage period, then u&amp;#039;ll get additional 10% NCD at the next renewal.    You might get even cheaper premium if you happen to cross into a different age group where the premium is cheaper during renewal. Example... from 29 to 30 year old.    But then, the overall premium is always rising due to &amp;#039;rising cost&amp;#039; (so the insurance coy say la). The drop in premium due to above factors might be offset by even greater increase in premium.
