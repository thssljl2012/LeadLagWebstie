After gaining in morning trading, RBS shares fell by 11 per cent to 10.3p as fears of full nationalisation continued to grip shareholders. Confidence in the sector was again undermined when US analysts said Bank of America might need an $80bn capital injection. The bank sparked panic last week when it announced big losses in credit markets. The Bank of New York Mellon brought forward its fourth-quarter results from Thursday after its shares lost nearly a third of their value yesterday.    Lloyds was the biggest faller in the UK banking sector, dropping 31 per cent to 44.8p, despite issuing a statement on Monday saying it was trading broadly in line with previous guidance. The bank, formed from the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB on Monday, sought to reassure the market again yesterday. "We have a robust capital position and a strong business model," a spokesman said. "We estimate our core tier-one capital ratio, a key measure, as at 31 December would be within our previously announced target range of 6-7 per cent."    He would not say if Lloyds would bring its results forward from 27 February.
