Short sellers have to buy back one day and pay commission in the meantime.  If the business is sound, then short selling does little harm and the sellers can often get badly burned.  The problem here, as has been evident since the awful new chairman, preening himself with Gordon Brown led LLoyds into the disastrous HBOS deal where they did not ( and do not) know the horrific liabilities they were assuming, is that the business is not sound.  How could the institutions have allowed this, only because they were HBOS shareholders as well, I suspect.  For Bank of America now "discovering" liabilities were worse than they thought in Merryl Lynch, read Lloyds -HBOS in the UK.  Lloyds Board were dazzled by prospects of power and bonuses and the business is very likely bust without Government takeover all IMHO   Price details at 2009-01-16 16:35:17:-  Bid: 98.40, Ask: 99.00, LastTrade: 98.40, Change: -4.93%
