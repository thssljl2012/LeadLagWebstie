          Re Barclays, however, I&amp;#039;d be amazed if they didn&amp;#039;t pick up some of the parts of Lehmans in this weeks fire sale....    Further evidence for that can be found here:   http://fool.uk-wire.com/cgi-bin/articles/200809150700083938D...   ....plainly all the relevant people remain fully engaged with the Lehman situation!   The other aspect of course is that banks now have to face quantifying their net exposures to Lehmans - this may well be substantial in many cases, quite probably including Barclays.  ee
