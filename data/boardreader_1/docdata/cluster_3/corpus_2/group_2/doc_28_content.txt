In fact, my understanding is that   UBS is more on the line here than any other foreign bank.     &amp;amp;nbsp;    John McCain&amp;#039;s top economics advisor, who is widely believed to be his choice for Treasury Secretary, should he win in November, is former Sen. Phil Gramm.  (Indeed, just last night his spokesman    refused to say    Gramm wouldn&amp;#039;t be McCain&amp;#039;s choice for Treasury Secretary.)   &amp;amp;nbsp;    Gramm is both      vice chairman of UBS&amp;#039;s US division and a lobbyist for UBS     .    &amp;amp;nbsp;   If UBS successfully lobbied over the weekend to get in on the bailout, what was Gramm&amp;#039;s role in the lobbying?   &amp;amp;nbsp;   --Josh Marshall        &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;nbsp;    This is tragic, we are on the brink of economic collapse. As for Gramm we already know he can&amp;#039;t be trusted. Gramm&amp;#039;s one of the biggest reasons the market is in this mess.

There are none so blind as those who will not see
