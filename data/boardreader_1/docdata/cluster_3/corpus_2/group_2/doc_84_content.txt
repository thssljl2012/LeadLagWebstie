 CWEI Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              Re: Federal Reserve MAY Cut Rates In Wake Of Financial Crisis - I tired of the over use of the word &amp;quot;MAY&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;MAY&amp;quot; should only be used with reference to the month...Of course the FED may, might, could cut rates. What the heck does that tell anybody.    If you have an opinion then state it..&amp;quot;MAY&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#039;t say anything...We all know that....it&amp;#039;s useless verbage...    The FED will not cut rates - that&amp;#039;s my opinion, not today, too much damage to be done to the dollar...AIG will fail, the insurance policies will be paid, their finacial pyramid of derivatives will fall and there will be damage to others&amp;#039; balance sheets....At this point I think the FED is prepared to let that happen...GOLD will ultimately be the winner....risk is down to $680...        thread start
