When RBS took over Natwest, this resulted in a combined market share (of current accounts) of 21%. Lloyds/TSB alone as 21%, and HBOS 14% ( source ).    Having a leader that&amp;#039;s 50% bigger than its next competitor is probably not healthy. That said, there are other markets to consider (personal mortgages, business banking...) so I&amp;#039;m sure if there is an opportunity to shout &amp;amp;quot;Monopoly!&amp;amp;quot;, HSBC, RBS or Barclays will do so within the next 10 minutes
