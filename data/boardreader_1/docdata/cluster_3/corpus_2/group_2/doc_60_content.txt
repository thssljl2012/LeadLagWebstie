So basically, the GOVERNMENT   is &amp;amp;quot;BAILING OUT&amp;amp;quot; major banking and insurance institutions of FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, AND AIG   that made poor loans to banks,   so the stupid American public could finance and buy OVERVALUED PROPERTIES AND BUSINESSES that they stupidly continued buying.   Example &amp;amp;quot;run down shacks for 240,000&amp;amp;quot; dollars.&amp;amp;quot;  So who are we bailing out really? Big time high finance EXECUTIVES AND THOSE who made bad property investments, capitalized and profited by making these bad loans.  PEOPLE this is saying to me CHARGE UP YOUR CREDIT CARDS AND DO NOT PAY THEM BACK while you got the chance.  This is what the BANKING EXECUTIVES have done with their loan practices so they might get bonuses, paybacks and higher executive compensation.  GUESS WHO ARE PAYING THE OVERPAYED, OVERCOMPENSATED EXECS OF THE BANKING INDUSTRY NOW.  Yes you!   The American Public who will be paying with higher taxes we are going to have to pay. THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE many of the extremely WEALTHY out there have flipped homes and businesses and profited hugely by PYRAMID scheming the American public. But many of us haven&amp;#039;t profited from this and now we are going to have to pay too.  Banking EXECUTIVES with their HIGH EXECUTIVE compensation are on nothing more than the top of a giant PYRAMID scheme.
