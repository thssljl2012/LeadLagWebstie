                       Another thought:  Are lehman&amp;#039;s employees worth less than AIG&amp;#039;s employees?  (They were both bankrupt and AIG is an insurance company. It seems to me that AIG&amp;#039;s employees (managers) are worse than lehman&amp;#039;s. But both are crap, anyway  )                                       Edited:  Wed Sep 17, 08  at  11:26 AM  by  BullBear
