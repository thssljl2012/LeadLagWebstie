US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said after meeting members of  Congress legislation would be required to rid banks of their bad  assets.       He said this was at the heart of the rescue plan, which will be worked out over the weekend.        US stocks had earlier surged on news of the rescue plan, with the Dow Jones up 3.86%, to 11,019.69.           Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei echoed the rally, with a 1.24% rise at Friday&amp;#039;s opening.        World markets have been volatile in the wake of huge upheavals among banks.        Since the start of the week, Lehman Brothers has collapsed, the Federal  Reserve has bailed out insurance giant AIG, Merrill Lynch has been  acquired by Bank of America and in the UK, Lloyds TSB has acquired  HBOS.       Mr Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke briefed Congress leaders on the plans they were considering.        &amp;quot;We talked about a comprehensive approach that will require legislation  to deal with illiquid assets on financial institutions&amp;#039; balance  sheets,&amp;quot; Mr Paulson said.       Democrat Senate Majority leader Harry Reid said he expected to have a proposal in a matter of hours, rather than days.
