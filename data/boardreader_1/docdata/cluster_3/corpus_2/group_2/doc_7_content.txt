QUESTION:        For all You Republicans: When a big business mismanages their money and screws up its OK for the taxpayers to foot the bill??        But if an American Citizen can&amp;#039;t buy food for their families and they need money thats Not OK???       You support the Government taking over these failing private Businesses, but on the Other hand.. Government has no place in private business?? It just doesnt make sense to me..                      Jonathan Martin - September 18, 2008      Obama spokesman Bill Burton, in the course of noting McCain&amp;#039;s flip-flop on the matter, lets slip that his boss backs the Fed&amp;#039;s $85 billion bailout of insurance giant AIG:   Considering the fact that John McCain flatly opposed the bailout of AIG a day before he changed course and supported it, were not sure why on earth the McCain campaign wants to have a debate about economic indecision. Barack Obama does not second guess the Feds decision to take unprecedented action to prevent the failure of one of the largest insurance companies in the world from creating an even larger crisis, and he believes it must protect families who count on insurance.&amp;quot;
