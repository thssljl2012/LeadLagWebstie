And what are the current curbs and stops, etc....can it even drop 2,860 in one day without shutting down the markets?  So it might take two or three days to get there.               Kris                         I am not an economist, and don&amp;#039;t even play one on TV, so please forgive me if this is a stupid question, but         Back in 1987 when the stock market crashed, wasn&amp;#039;t the rest of the financial world basically OK?         By that I mean, we didn&amp;#039;t have Fannie &amp;amp;amp; Freddie crashing too, and major investment banking firms being taken over or going under, and insurance companies like AIG and automakers like Ford begging for Uncle Sugar bailouts, and big banks like IndyMac already down and others (like Washington Mutual, Wachovia, and maybe others) about to go down, etc. etc. , right?         I was a very young man back in 1987 and didn&amp;#039;t have much back then so I just don&amp;#039;t remember for sure, but I do remember when I heard the stock market was crashing, thinking how that was unfortunate, but at least it did not affect me.         And as far as I am aware, that crash never did affect me.         This one, however, I figure is going to hit everybody BIG TIME...
