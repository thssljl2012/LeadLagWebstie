                                         Quote:                          Originally Posted by  refined silver                         Gold&amp;#039;s two recent tops where it was hammered were $1030 on the day of the Bear Sterns rescue, and $840ish at the time of the Fannie and Freddie rescue.       In both cases, the Wall St and media spin was everything is ok now, the worst is over, the Fed has provided liquidity and its all good now.      This weekend, we&amp;#039;ve got Lehman Bros, the 4th biggest US investment bank about to or already failed. Merryl Lynch is being bought out by BoA (where will they get the $40b????), AIG the world&amp;#039;s biggest insurance co is asking for a $40b loan or saying they will be dead in 48hrs.  http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/20.../index.html?hp    The US Fed are saying we&amp;#039;ll now take basically anything as collateral.  http://news.goldseek.com/GoldSeek/1221454799.php          Were the premises under which gold was hammered right or wrong? Looks like they were so wrong it wasn&amp;#039;t funny, and the spin was pure lies and BS.      If Lehman fails it triggers CDSs wherever it is a counterparty. If AIG goes, or is downgraded they are the major underwriter of CDSs and other OTC derivatives. Ready for a $60 trillion unwind? Got gold or silver?                                             Well I agree with you as usual..   and then there is this chart, completely out of line with the fundamentals, a bit like the past few months of market action.   Personally I&amp;#039;d like to see how this technical situation resolves, and convincing bottoms in gold and oil before adding.. wouldn&amp;#039;t want to discourage anyone else from buying though.      EURUSD daily 2005-2008 - made a few hours ago.. down a couple of percent since then on very high volume..
