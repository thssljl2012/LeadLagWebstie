         I was worried about the size of the exposure of Barclays as creditor of Lehman but am no longer worried because the exposure seems to be immaterial in the context of Barclays&amp;#039; net assets and profitability:  &amp;amp;quot;Lloyds TSB and Standard Chartered of the UK are among the banks listed as top-30 unsecured creditors of Lehman Brothers. Lloyds is owed $75.4m (42.1m) by Lehman in the form of a letter of credit. Standard Chartered is owed a $41m  bank loan  and $36.1m under a letter of credit.&amp;amp;quot;  Source: Barclays Stockbrokers: Morning Call
