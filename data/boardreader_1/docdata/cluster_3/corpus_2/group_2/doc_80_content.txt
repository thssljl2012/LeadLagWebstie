The UK government is also authoring the &amp;#039;nationalisation&amp;#039; of another bank, if that is what it turns out to be. The Bradford and Bingley (ex-building society) is in deep trouble, apparently, and the UK government and/or BoE are in the process of selling or nationalising it now, with a firm intent to have the whole plan sewn-up before the UK stock markets open tomorrow.     I find it interesting that so far in the UK the biggest problems have afflicted organisations that were formerly non-banks. I attribute that to a lack of wider expertise which has led to over-exposure to some types of risk. Of course there are some genuine banks that could fall flat on their faces, but I hope that there are fewer of those.....     It is also MHO that the government (of any country) will have to step in to effect any remedy with failing banks. This is because banks are only interested in their own particular circumstances and are predatory by nature.  We saw this recently with Barclays and Lehman Bros. There is no way they are going to step in and pay more when they can just watch and wait, and then pick up the interesting pieces for a song some time later.
