What McCain has proposed is, allowing insurance companies to sell their health insurance products across state lines (not currently allowed) - which would spread their risk pool and would reduce premiums substantially.     On this issue, I agree with Senator McCain                                         __________________             &amp;amp;quot;Tomorrow is the most important thing in life.
