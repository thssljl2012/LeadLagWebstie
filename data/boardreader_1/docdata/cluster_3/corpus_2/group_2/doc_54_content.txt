It wouldn&amp;#039;t have been possible prior to that for AIG to be in this business without that industry deregulation, specifically the repeal of Glass/Steagall (at least the parts that were designed to curtail derivatives as instruments of speculation).  So, yes, the CDS&amp;#039;s weren&amp;#039;t technically deregulated, the industry deregulation made it possible for them to be created and traded in the first place.  I stand corrected.                         Thanks for making this clearer.
