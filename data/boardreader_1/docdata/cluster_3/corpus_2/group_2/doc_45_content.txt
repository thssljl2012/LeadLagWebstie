            Latest:      1) Lehman Brothers will go bankrupt--no buyers.  Perhaps there would have been (Bank of America or Barclays) had the US government guaranteed trading obligations of Lehmans until a transaction was final (which they did with Bear Stearns), but they (the government) did not.  There is an unwillingness to invoke further moral hazard for obvious reasons.  But other mitigating reasons were 1) Lehmans&amp;#039; failure probably has less severe implications for follow-on multiple bank confidence crises (&amp;amp;quot;systemic risk&amp;amp;quot;) because it is neither a deposit taking institution (Northern Rock, UK) nor does it have a substantial prime-brokerage business (Bear Stearns), and 2) there has been more time elapsed for counterparties of Lehman to prepare in advance for this event (not just including a Sunday trading session in which yours truly had to work).  So Lehmans&amp;#039; shares will be suspended and worthless, it defaults on its debt (expected recovery rates are guesswork but around 30%) and credit-related transactions with Lehmans (the stuff that was being shut down yesterday by other institutions) will be voided due to its insolvency.      2) Various stuff about the US Federal Reserve further expanding the types of things it will accept as collateral (subject to a risk-adjusting haircut) to lend to banks.  Not many banks are using this facility though.      3) Merrill Lynch (&amp;amp;quot;the one that would be next&amp;amp;quot;) has arranged to sell itself to Bank of America to remove the possibility of a contagious speculative attack.      4) Ten banks have set up a private USD70bn lending facility that that stands outside any central authority arrangements (like the Fed) to help each other out if need be.  This is a commercial &amp;amp;quot;lender of second-last resort&amp;amp;quot; decision that is in the same vein as &amp;amp;quot;the herd learning that it is overwhelmingly in their interest not to stampede&amp;amp;quot;
