That&amp;#039;s funny, it was two Republican administrations that spent like money grew on trees that led to the last one.      Go Bluelamp, you are on it! Here is McSame bragging about deregulating the financial industry -- in his own words, AND also proposing market-based health reform: &amp;amp;quot;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&amp;amp;quot; What&amp;#039;s his excuse now? Will he &amp;#039;flip-flop&amp;#039; or keep pretending that the $62 trillion market for credit default swaps does not need regulatory oversight? Warren E. Buffett called these things financial weapons of mass destruction. McSame is a BOMB and we are the target.
