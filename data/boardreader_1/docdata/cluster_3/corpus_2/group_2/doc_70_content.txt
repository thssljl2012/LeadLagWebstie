   Meanwhile, broader efforts to tackle problems plaguing the industry are underway.  The Federal Reserve announced a series of steps to support the financial markets. The Fed said it would expand its short-term lending to banks by starting to take all investment-grade debt as collateral - instead of just Treasurys and other high-grade securities.  &amp;quot;The steps we are announcing today, along with significant commitments from the private sector, are intended to mitigate the potential risks and disruptions to markets,&amp;quot; said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.  Similarly, a group of 10 commercial and investment banks including, among others, Goldman Sachs (  GS  ,   Fortune 500  ), Citigroup, Barclays and Morgan Stanley, agreed to pony up $7 billion each to create a $70 billion lending pool to help troubled institutions.  The measure would also help resolve exposure between Lehman Brothers and its counterparties, the companies said.  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who has led efforts to help get the U.S. housing market and the broader economy back on track, applauded the plan and steps taken by regulators.  &amp;quot;These initiatives will be critical to facilitating liquid, smooth functioning markets, and addressing potential concerns in the credit markets,&amp;quot; Paulson said in a statement.
