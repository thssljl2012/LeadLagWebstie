   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; It is so strong that virtually every investment bank on Wall Street went belly up, or was salvaged by the government, or Warren Buffet. It is so strong that AIG is effectively a government ran insurance company. It is so strong that we have to have $800 billion in taxpayer dollars to bail out the banks. What kind of nonsense are you peddling? And where are we going to get that money, in any case? What will we give China in return?
