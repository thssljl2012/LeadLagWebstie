           Advertisements [ ? ]                         John Waples and Danny Fortson From Times Online September 21, 2008   STAFF at Lehmans New York office who helped to cause the worlds biggest corporate bankruptcy are to share in a $2.5 billion bonanza.   The bonus, which has been described by London staff as a scandal has been pledged by Barclays Capital, the British-based bank that last week acquired Lehmans American operation and took on 10,000 staff.   The $2.5 billion (1.4 billion) pot, which has been ring-fenced as part of the acquisition, has caused huge resentment among the 5,000 staff in the firms European and Middle Eastern operations who are not guaranteed to be paid after this month. There are, however, hopes that half the jobs in Lehmans Canary Wharf office could be saved today by either Barclays or Nomura. Bids are being submitted for its UK equities and investment-banking business.   A Chapter 11 bankruptcy document filed by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc says that Barclays has identified eight individuals out of the New York staff of 10,000 who are vital to make the deal succeed and a further 200 who are identified as key. It is thought that these eight directors will be locked into two-year contracts worth between $10m and $25m a year.   &amp;amp;lt;more&amp;amp;gt;   http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry...                         ...
