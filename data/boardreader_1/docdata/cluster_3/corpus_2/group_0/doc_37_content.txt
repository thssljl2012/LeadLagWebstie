 If things keep at this rate I can see a worst case scenario for owners as affordability fallings back 1980s and 1990s levels.      The only thing stopping it are the last remnants of the property overvaluers/over bidders, who see 80s and 90s affordability type prices as just too cheap, and 80s and 90s as the ignorant dark ages from a property valuation point of view.      There are plenty of properties for sale so its not a supply issue ala dubai or something.         As an aside I had this exchange starting from the bottom on the &amp;amp;quot;2.8m&amp;amp;quot; almost finished project ... 3 storeys, 350m2 double brick with huge ocean views, which has dropped from 2.2 to 1.3 in 2 months!!!!!! 300k to finish internally tops.
