          Rang DD yesterday and was told the structured protected commodity products should be OK as DD were merely distributors and the Medium Term Notes were issued by Barclays or JP Morgan. I was interested in No. II and I was told the issuer was Barclays, and the Notes were with a nominee company, and only if Barclays went insolvent would my inv&amp;#039;t be at risk....   Keydata Investment Services Limited are headed on the correspondence I&amp;#039;ve had about my DD product.  Not sure what the link is between DD and Keydata, but I rang their Client Services and was told essentially the same as you.  I was assured that all investments were done via separate co.&amp;#039;s so were unnaffected by DDG&amp;#039;s problems, and that that the notes were issued either by Morgan Stanley or Barclays.
