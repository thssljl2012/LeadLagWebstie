         &amp;amp;quot; SYDNEY/LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank (NAB.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) has pulled out of talks to buy ABN AMRO&amp;#039;s Australian and New Zealand unit from Royal Bank of Scotland, it said on Tuesday, just over a week after announcing it was in negotiations.  RBS (RBS.L: Quote, Profile, Research) led a consortium of banks in the takeover of Dutch rival ABN last year and is selling the Australian unit as part of efforts to restore its balance sheet, battered by the sector&amp;#039;s biggest ever takeover and the global credit crunch.  Two other bidders are reported to remain in the running for the Australian unit, valued at around A$800 million ($784 million), but the withdrawal of a high-profile suitor is likely to focus attention again on RBS&amp;#039;s planned asset sales, as interest in its insurance unit, the largest asset on the block, dwindles.  The Australian Financial Review reported earlier this month that Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) and Japan&amp;#039;s Nomura (8604.T: Quote, Profile, Research) were bidders for ABN&amp;#039;s Australian unit.  RBS declined to comment on Tuesday. NAB also offered no explanation for its decision to withdraw from talks.&amp;amp;quot;   http://uk.reuters.com/article/UK_MERGERS/idUKL22564938200807...
