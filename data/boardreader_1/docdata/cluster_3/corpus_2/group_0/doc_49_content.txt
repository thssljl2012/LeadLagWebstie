Looks like nowadays many big houses and investment bankers are making  the last effort at touting you to be the  bagholders.        They told you to jump in when ENER was around 80 only to see it get  beaten down to low 60s in less than 2 weeks. Same story with CSIQ,  FSLR and many flying  pigs.            ++++++++         Barclays warns of a financial storm as Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s  credibility crumbles            28/06/2008            US central bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock that will  rock financial markets, reports Ambrose Evans-Pritchard      Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for  a worldwide financial storm, warning that the US Federal Reserve has  allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its  credibility fall &amp;amp;quot;below zero&amp;amp;quot;.            &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re in a nasty environment,&amp;amp;quot; said Tim Bond, the bank&amp;#039;s chief  equity strategist. &amp;amp;quot;There is an inflation shock underway. This is  going to be very negative for financial assets. We are going into  tortoise mood and are retreating into our shell. Investors will do  well if they can preserve their wealth.&amp;amp;quot;            Barclays Capital said in its closely-watched Global Outlook that US  headline inflation would hit 5.5pc by August and the Fed will have  to raise interest rates six times by the end of next year to prevent  a wage-spiral. If it hesitates, the bond markets will take matters  into their own hands. &amp;amp;quot;This is the first test for central banks in  30 years and they have fluffed it. They have zero credibility, and  the Fed is negative if that&amp;#039;s possible. It has lost all  credibility,&amp;amp;quot; said Mr Bond.      ----------------------------------------            RBS credit strategy team warns of worst market crash in 100 years            Global stockmarkets are braced for one of the worst crashes in 100  years, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) credit strategy  team.            In a special report, the RBS credit strategy team said it expects  inflation to paralyse economies and spark the crash.      The report advised investors to be prepared for a severe downturn  in global stock and credit markets, saying the S&amp;amp;P 500 index is  likely to fall by more than 300 points to around 1,050 points by  September.          It added that such falls across the globe would amount to one of  the worst bear markets in the last 100  years.
