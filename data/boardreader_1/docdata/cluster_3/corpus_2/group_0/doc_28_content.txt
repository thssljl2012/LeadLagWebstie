       National Australia Bank&amp;#039;s Write-Down May Lead to Higher Funding Costs  &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;Hey!!!  Its contained to subprime....US subprime.&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;  By ENDA CURRAN July 25, 2008 3:44 a.m.  SYDNEY -- National Australia Bank could face higher funding costs after the bank surprised investors Friday with   a write-down of 830 million Australian dollars (US$796.1 million),   blaming the global credit crunch and slumping U.S. housing sector.    NAB said the write-down was for its exposure to a   A$1.2 billion portfolio of 10 collateralized debt obligations backed by U.S. residential mortgages.      Ratings agency Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s said the news will unsettle investor confidence, and warned of a potential increase in funding charges. &amp;amp;quot;Today&amp;#039;s announcement highlights that NAB may face challenges in predicting future credit losses,&amp;amp;quot; Credit Analyst Sharad Jain said. &amp;amp;quot;Furthermore,   such developments could reduce investor confidence, which would put pressure on the bank&amp;#039;s funding access and costs.&amp;amp;quot;    S&amp;amp;amp;P left it&amp;#039;s rating on the bank unchanged at AA, but changed its outlook from &amp;amp;quot;stable&amp;amp;quot; to &amp;amp;quot;negative.&amp;amp;quot;  Analysts at Lehman Brothers said NAB&amp;#039;s total provisions for the fiscal year that ends September 2008 now stand at A$1.56 billion, up from A$726 million at its interim results announced in May, &amp;amp;quot;and will clearly hurt profitability.&amp;amp;quot;   &amp;amp;quot;This latest news raises the risk profile of NAB in terms of asset quality and   leaves questions on other exposures that might be lurking,&amp;amp;quot;   Lehman said.    (Personal Comment:  I would just love to find out what is lurking in Lehman&amp;#039;s Tier II and III)  The timing of the disclosure has irked fixed-income investors, coming only days after the bank completed a hefty bond sale. On Tuesday, NAB raised A$850 million through the increase of its existing 2011 bond line, priced at 0.9 percentage point over the bank bill reference rate.  Fund managers say if the same deal was brought to market in the light of the write-down, the premium sought would be wider. Other investors concurred, saying the premium expected from NAB, and possibly Australia &amp;amp;amp; New Zealand Bank, would now be higher than domestic peers Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corporation.    NAB&amp;#039;s disclosure will likely unsettle further fragile investors in Australia&amp;#039;s shattered fixed-income market, who are   still reeling after incurring significant portfolio losses since the global credit crisis erupted in 2007.      Reflecting the deterioration in investor confidence, the cost of insuring against NAB defaulting on its corporate debt widened immediately after the bank&amp;#039;s announcement, a trader said.  The credit default swap spread on the bank&amp;#039;s senior five-year debt has widened by 0.13 percentage point to 0.93 percentage point and the CDS on National Australia&amp;#039;s subordinated debt has widened 0.25 percentage point to 1.45 percentage points. The senior debt spread is around 0.05 percentage point wider than CDS on Commonwealth Bank and Westpac and the subordinated debt CDS is around 0.1 percentage point wider.
