I find it interesting that Barclay&amp;#039;s National is one  of the banks in the InBev consortium,  and    also one of the banks assisting  in    their stock  sale.        Barclay&amp;#039;s investment arm is also the largest holder  of AB  stock.        I wonder where they are going  to    cast their vote for the  InBev    offer if it ever gets to  the    shareholders.   They stand to  make    a ton of money if AB  accepts    InBev&amp;#039;s offer.    Hmmmmmmm...I&amp;#039;ll    bet they are going to vote  &amp;amp;quot;yes&amp;amp;quot;.    Just a  hunch.
