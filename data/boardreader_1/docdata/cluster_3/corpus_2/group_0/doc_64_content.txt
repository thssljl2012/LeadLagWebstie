Read the Paribas post, and the reasoning behind it. It  is not  B.S.    The poster forced me to do research and  thinking.Obviously, this is largely speculation. I  still think that Gasparino was aware of  something!       Let me know what you  think!       I am the one who commented with some geopolitical  factors, which might bring a Barclays, Deutsche,  Santander,HSB, or even a Japanese player in to the  picture.
