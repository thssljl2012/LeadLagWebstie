 I used Barclays stockbrokers, you can do it all over the phone, BA shares are pretty volatile over the last few months, as you have missed the end of May qualifying date for the discount from Novermber, I would hang tight and wait for them to drop below 2 again, if there are any problems with the final move to T5 (hope not) it could have some impact on the share price and then would be the time to buy   I am not a share expert, I am in the same position as you, these were the only shares I have bought since BT in the 80s,
