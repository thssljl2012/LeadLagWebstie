Actually, July 2 was the date of record for receiving  the &amp;amp;quot;right&amp;amp;quot; (one for every 4.67 appx shares owned) to  purchase additional shares as part of the raising of  capital. This has nothing to do with the  dividend.          http://www.investorrelations.barclays.co...          http://www.offer.barclays.com/index_main...        Not an awesome deal from what I can tell as they are  being issued at 282p (UK) and closed at 279p (UK) on  Friday.
