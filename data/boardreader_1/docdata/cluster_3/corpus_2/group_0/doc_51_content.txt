    President Puss:      Nory: DOW is up 80 points If only the DOW was an economic indicator...    Really... the DOW is so easily controllable. Barclays owns 20 percent of the DOW and between the Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets, the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the primary dealers and investment banks of the Federal Reserve, you can have the DOW do almost anything at any time.  I don&amp;#039;t take those very seriously who rely on the DOW as an economic indicator. It&amp;#039;s a goddamn joke.
