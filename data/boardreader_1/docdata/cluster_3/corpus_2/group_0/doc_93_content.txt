    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Barclays sold 1M+ this quarter    http://www.nasdaq.com/asp/holdings.asp?symbol=NXG&amp;amp;selected=NXG&amp;amp;FormType=Institutional     Looks like we had a big seller this past quarter, I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if Renaissance has diminished their holdings too. The big question is who started selling first. If Barclays started first, I&amp;#039;m sure Renaissance&amp;#039;s black box would have picked up on it and started selling too.     Looks like the shine came off with the weak 1st quarter numbers, perhaps we can win them back with a great 2nd quarter.  Thank goodness gold is cooperating.   Haynz
