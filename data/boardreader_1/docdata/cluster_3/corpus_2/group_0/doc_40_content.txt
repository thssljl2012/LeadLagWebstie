American International Group Inc. plans to absorb losses for a dozen insurance units after their securities-lending accounts suffered $13 billion of writedowns tied to the subprime-mortgage collapse during the past year.  The world&amp;#039;s largest insurer will assume as much as $5 billion of any losses on sales of the investments, up from a previous commitment of $500 million, said Christopher Swift, vice president for life and retirement services, in an interview. AIG also will inject an undisclosed amount of capital into some of the subsidiaries, he said.  Moody&amp;#039;s Investors Service and A.M. Best Co. both cited the writedowns in May when they downgraded New York-based AIG&amp;#039;s credit ratings. State regulators in Texas said they didn&amp;#039;t know AIG was investing cash collateral from the securities-lending business in subprime-linked assets and were concerned the insurance units hadn&amp;#039;t put aside enough capital to cover potential losses.  ``We were aware of this portfolio, but we didn&amp;#039;t have transparency on what was in it because it was off-balance sheet&amp;#039;&amp;#039; in the company&amp;#039;s statutory accounting reports, said Doug Slape, chief analyst at the Texas Department of Insurance in Austin, which oversees three AIG insurers that have suffered about 60 percent of the writedowns.     &amp;quot;State regulators in Texas said they didn&amp;#039;t know AIG was investing cash collateral from the securities-lending business in subprime-linked assets and were concerned the insurance units hadn&amp;#039;t put aside enough capital to cover potential losses.&amp;quot;  In this case, cash was put up as collateral, but AIG put the money in subprime-linked assets.
