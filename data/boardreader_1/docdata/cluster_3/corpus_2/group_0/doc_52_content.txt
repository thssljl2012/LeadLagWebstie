Wayne Swann demands banks explain why they are increasing interest rates. Basically he understands that the costs of doing banking have increased since sub-prime but its still not enough justification to explain why they are increasing rates to make it harder for working families.                       Part of my job is to explain to customers of the bank I work for why rates have been increasing.     Customer: I&amp;#039;d like you to tell me why my interest rate has gone up 1.5% when the reserve bank has only put up rates by 0.75%     Me: Certainly sir, it&amp;#039;s because of the increased cost of borrowing.     Customer: &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s because your bank is foreign isnt it&amp;amp;quot;?     Me: &amp;amp;quot;Certainly not sir, if you look around, most other lenders have rates that are very similar to ours.  This is because other lenders all borrow from the same places and in the same ways we do.  It doesnt matter if your head office is in Sydney, Melbourne, Hong Kong, London or New York.   ALL Banks in Australia borrow money from the same places and have the same pressures.&amp;amp;quot;     Customer: &amp;amp;quot;Other banks havent put their rates up outside of the reserve bank like youse have&amp;amp;quot;     Me:  &amp;amp;quot;Well if other banks had similar interest rates to us 12 months ago and they have similar rates to us now then I would suggest that there is a strong possibility that they have raised the rates outside of the reserve bank&amp;amp;quot;     Customer: &amp;amp;quot;St George are 0.3% lower than you&amp;amp;quot;     Me: &amp;amp;quot;They were until they moved their rates up by 0.2% last Friday, now the gap is 0.1%&amp;amp;quot;     Customer: &amp;amp;quot;Yeah but the reserve bank has only put up rates by 0.75% - you&amp;#039;ve put mine up by 1.5%&amp;amp;quot;     Me:  &amp;amp;quot;Unfortunately the costs of how we source our funds have been going up continually over the past 12 months.  In fact, not including reserve bank rises it now costs us more than 1% more to borrow than it did a year ago by securitisation and almost 2% more if we lend out savings deposited with the bank&amp;amp;quot;     Customer: &amp;amp;quot;I dont believe youse blokes, you&amp;#039;re always attacking the little man.  You just dont care about your customers&amp;amp;quot;     Me:  &amp;amp;quot;No decision to raise rates is ever done lightly, but we need to maintain a margin on loans to remain profitable.  Some lenders have actually left the mortgages market as they were unable to offer competative products.  Even though our own costs have risen by more than 1% over and above the reserve bank rises, your rate has not.  That means we&amp;#039;re taking smaller margins and reduced profits in order to help our customers through these difficult times.     Customer: &amp;amp;quot;Yeah but your still making huge profits&amp;amp;quot;     Me:  &amp;amp;quot;Globally some areas of the business are doing well.  That&amp;#039;s what enables us to absorb some of the costs which we could have passed on to our mortgage customers.     Customer:  &amp;amp;quot;My rate with youse is 9.5% I&amp;#039;ve been offered a rate elsewhere of 8%     Me:  &amp;amp;quot;Sir, we&amp;#039;re paying more than 8% on deposit funds to clients at the moment.  If you&amp;#039;ve found a home loan with a rate of 8% then I would suggest you take it.  In fact our cost of borrowing on new funds TODAY is 9%.  If you can find lenders offering way below that then please give me their number as I want my loan there as well.     Customer: &amp;amp;quot;Whats the best you can offer me?&amp;amp;quot;     Me: 9%     Customer&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;you&amp;#039;re taking the piss.  All you big companies do is try and screw the little bloke etc etc etc&amp;amp;quot;        Thank you Mr Swan for giving idiots like this reasons to ring me up and make my life miserable by having to point out the bleedin fucking obvious to them.
