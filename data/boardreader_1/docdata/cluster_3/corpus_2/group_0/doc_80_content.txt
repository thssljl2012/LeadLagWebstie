My post on 26-Jun-08 at 10:21 pm. (Cytec opened at  $59.40)    So you will see $50 by August and $40 by December,  trust me. Well if I had trusted myself I would have  shorted it, but I didn&amp;#039;t, short it, that  is.        Well, sorry folks I was wrong.   Cytec won&amp;#039;t be $50  by August. It was $50.54 at noon on 7/3!   Maybe I  should have said $40 by August !   You bagholders  will be here a long time before you see north of $60.          garieh4 on 23-Jun-08 at 10:48 am (Cytec closed at  $59.33)    I&amp;#039;d buy Cytec in a heartbeat at 55 and lower. She  pops back to 60 real fast.            So, garieh4, how&amp;#039;s you&amp;#039;re new stock purchases at $55  working out?   Getting rich? That pop to $60 happened  so fast it wasn&amp;#039;t even recorded !            In November of 1997 Cytec was $50.62, now almost 11  years later it is the same price (ignoring the 11  years of time valued inflation).   Way to go David  &amp;amp;quot;Lilley-Pads for Brains&amp;amp;quot; !   Using $600 million to  buy back stock sure was a great way to return value  to the shareholders.            On July 20th, 2007 Cytec hit a new high at $74.25.    But going from $50.62 to $74.25 in 11 years is  nothing to brag about.   Why is the man still at the  top?   Why haven&amp;#039;t the shareholders run this ass out  of the company?   A chimpanzee throwing darts at a  stock chart would have a 96% probability of chosing  investments that performed better than David &amp;amp;quot;Lilley  Pads for Brains&amp;amp;quot; has performed as Cytec&amp;#039;s  CEO.        These names represent 40% of Cytec&amp;#039;s Shares:    Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Ltd, Lord  Abbett &amp;amp; Co. , Ospraie Managment LP, Clearbridge  Advisors, LLC,    Vanguard Group.   Axa Group , Bank  of New York,   Mellon Corp., Wachovia Corp, ING  Investment Management Europe B.V. Legg Mason Partners  Appreciation Fd., Lord Abbett all Value Fund,  Columbia Acorn Fund, College Retirement Equities  Fund-Stock Account,   Lord Abbett Research  Fund.        They could run him out (jail him) along with the  Board of Directors.   It baffles me why they do  nothing but loose value for the common man who owns  these funds.   You bagholders should sell now to cut  your future losses.   Park your money  elsewhere.
