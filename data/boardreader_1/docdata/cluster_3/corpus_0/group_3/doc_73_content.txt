         Sky News is reporting, as repeatedly foretold by this blog from the day of its announcement, the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS will not proceed.  Links to be provided when available.This Guardian report indicates the reports have substance but do not provide confirmation.Elsewhere Eurozone members are reported to be about to guarantee interbank lending, if only these wasted billions could be directed to the aid of those with negative home equity - almost at a stroke the banks would then be able to resume normal activities!Tomorrow looks like being another hectic start to the week, as I blogged here seven days ago, I will report things as they appear to me on the morrow.  G'night!Labels: Gordon Brown, HBOS
