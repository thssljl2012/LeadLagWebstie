From Robert Peston's blog on the BBC News website:We own the banksWho would have thought, only a few weeks ago, that taxpayers would end up owning around 60% of Royal Bank of Scotland and about 40% of a super retail bank formed by Lloyds TSB buying HBOS.But that's what has been announced today by the Treasury, in what will count as perhaps the most extraordinary day in British banking history.Those three banks alone are raising 37bn from the state, with Royal Bank of Scotland taking 20bn of that.Thought for the day: Since we now collectively own all these banks, does that mean we can lobby our MPs to get those bloody awful Halifax adverts with the singing bank clerks taken off the air?
