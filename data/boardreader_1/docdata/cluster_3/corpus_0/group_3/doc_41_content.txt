The Prime Minister is taking a huge gamble on his political survival over the future of HBOS, in whose proposed takeover by Lloyds TSB he personally intervened.Lloyds is offering the equivalent of 188p for every HBOS share, but yesterday HBOS closed at 122.40p, a fall of 13.8 per cent on the day. Its hard to see how the deal can go ahead in its present form; Lloyds shareholders will be extraordinarily reluctant to see their company pay 50 per cent over the odds for a company whose stock apparently remains in freefall.This is very bad news for the Prime Minister on several fronts. The potential collapse of one of the countrys biggest retail banks and arguably its best-known mortgage lender would be bad enough in itself, but the political fallout in Scotland would be devastating for Labour. The demise of such an iconic Sottish institution as HBOS would almost certainly mean defeat in the Glenrothes by-election, which is the next awful hurdle facing the PM. The loss of what ought to be a rock-solid seat might well be enough to trigger a direct challenge for the party leadership.Mr Brown is reported in todays Times as confident the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS will go ahead. That is very brave talk. If the deal doesnt come off, the Prime Ministers remaining political credibility may be terminally undermined.
