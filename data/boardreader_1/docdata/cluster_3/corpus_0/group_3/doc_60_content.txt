         I found this interesting article yesterday by the BBC's Robert Peston (definitely the man of the moment in financial reporting, he has broken all the major "credit crunch" stories in Britain) concerning the impending takeover of HBOS (my employers) by Lloyds TSB. What he has to say is very sensible. Like him, I read the reported quote in the Guardian from the "major investor" with a feeling of disbelief.
