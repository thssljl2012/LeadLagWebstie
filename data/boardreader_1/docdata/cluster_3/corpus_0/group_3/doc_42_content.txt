     What an incredible month. Financial news moved on to the main news arena when the credit crunch began in August 2007. But in September 2008, interest in markets, banking, mortgages and savings surpassed anything seen before.  Nearly 1.35m visitors came to This is Money in a month - that's nearly 60% up on September 2007, which was pretty busy in its own right given the nationalisation of Northern Rock.   Your concerns led the agenda: savings safety, with particular interest in Icelandic banks with even some archived stories making the top ten; the Lloyds-HBOS takeover; the woes of the FTSE 100.  Anyway, see for yourself with the list below.
