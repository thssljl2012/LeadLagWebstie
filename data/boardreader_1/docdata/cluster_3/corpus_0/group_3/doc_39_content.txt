The Lloyds TSB take over of HBOS was an ill thought out rescue plan that would benefit only one person - our glorious unelected Leader.Sure Lloyds TSB looked as if they were getting the bargain of the century, but I think they might have found out there were a few more surprises hidden on/off the HBOS balance sheet.Plus I think they would have found themselves mired in all sorts of political wrangling north of the border with the Scottish element of what they had bought.Also the way the share price is falling should tell Lloyds TSB the market thinks it was a political stitch up from the beginning.So I'm not going to keep my fingers crossed it goes thru in it's current shape with-out our glorious unelected Leader making further concessions.
