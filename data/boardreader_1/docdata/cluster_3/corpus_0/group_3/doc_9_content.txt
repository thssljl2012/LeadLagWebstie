I have learned that Alistair Darling has called in the UK's banking bosses to 11 Downing Street at 6pm this evening. I am presuming they are not getting together to watch World Grand Prix Darts on Sky. As I write RBS is down 15%, Barclays 12% and they are supposed to be the good ones. My editor has asked me to come up with a simple explanation of "bank recapitalisation". Can anybody help me?
