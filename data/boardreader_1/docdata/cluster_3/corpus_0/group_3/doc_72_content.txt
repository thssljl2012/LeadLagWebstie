We have lost count of the billions of our money that have been injected into British banks, This morning yet another 37 billions have been given to the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS and Lloyds TSB. We only hope that now the bankers will deliver and assist to restore confidence in British banks. If this fails we will be staring into the abyss and disaster will affect us all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
