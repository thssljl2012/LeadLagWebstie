Here's today's output editor, Robert:  Good morning everyone,  What an extraordinary day. The Treasury has announced it is putting 37 billion into the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HBOS, in return for shares.    More than half the money will be used to shore up RBS, whose chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, is resigning.   The government has insisted that no cash bonuses are paid to senior directors of the three banks this year.    Do come to the meeting armed with ideas on how we are going to do this story. We're bidding for Darling on these events.   This will form part of a special entitled Credit Crunch: The Trial, asking who is to blame for the current financial crisis.   The programme will hear from a former bank boss, a hedge fund manager, politician and regulator - all senior in their fields - who will be giving evidence on the global financial turmoil and how it has come to pass.   We will also feature the results of a ComRes poll asking people who they think is to blame for the current crisis.   Robert
