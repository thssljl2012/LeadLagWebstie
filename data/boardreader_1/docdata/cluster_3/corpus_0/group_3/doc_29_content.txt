It is positive to hear this morning that Sir Fred Goodwin, the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, has resigned.   His company has accepted &amp;pound;20bn of taxpayer money to stay afloat.  The government buying &amp;pound;5bn of preference shares and underwriting &amp;pound;15bn of ordinary shares, making the taxpayer the majority owner.  HBOS and Lloyds TSB have also accepted taxpayer funds.  The combined total investment is around &amp;pound;37bn.  Barclays are 'going it alone' and plan to raise &amp;pound;6.5bn on their own.  Remember that this is an investment.  Over the long term we should see a decent return of this investment, particularly as the government is buying at what looks a lot like the bottom of the market.
