The Abbey in Hyde is on the corner of Hamnett Street and next door but one to the White Lion.Originally it was the Abbey National Building Society before demutulising in 1989 to become a bank. In 2004 it was taken over by the Spanish based bank Santander. National was dropped from the name and it is now known simply as the Abbey.Last week I showed you the local branch of the Bradford and Bingley, which has featured heavily in the news. It seems probable that the Abbey could be taking over some of the B &amp; B's business. However, as with the Lloyds TSB/Halifax BOS takeover, these things take time and for the moment it is business as usual as far as branch customers are concerned.
