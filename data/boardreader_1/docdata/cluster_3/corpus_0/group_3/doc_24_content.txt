From the BBC story:Barclays has struck a deal to raise &amp;pound;6.5bn of new capital - saying it was confident of raising that from shareholders and investors, rather than going to the government - meaning it will not have the government influencing its day-to-day decisions.It also said it would abandon its dividend for the second half of this year, to save &amp;pound;2bn. So, that seemingly leaves Barclays and HSBC outside the scope of this deal... with RBOS, HBOS&amp;nbsp;and Lloyds TSB accepting the government's funding. Um. Will need a while to thinl about the implications, but at first glance it sounds like Barclays have done the right thing, if they're sure about that funding...
