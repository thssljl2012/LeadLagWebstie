Hmm.. A good idea is to buy stocks cheap. When the economy is hurting (like it clearly is) everything is undervalued&amp;#8211; meaning that in 5+ years they&amp;#8217;ll be worth much more once the economy turns around. Like it always does. That&amp;#8217;s right people, markets cycle like Nephites. Buy low sell high? Right now it&amp;#8217;s low. [...]  Hmm.. A good idea is to buy stocks cheap. When the economy is hurting (like it clearly is) everything is undervalued&amp;#8211; meaning that in 5+ years they&amp;#8217;ll be worth much more once the economy turns around. Like it always does. That&amp;#8217;s right people, markets cycle like Nephites. Buy low sell high? Right now it&amp;#8217;s low. Buy time. I can&amp;#8217;t promise it&amp;#8217;s bottomed out yet (best time to buy), but it&amp;#8217;s pretty cheap.  So what should I buy? Well, look at what is really hurting right now but isn&amp;#8217;t out for the count. Bear Stearns. I&amp;#8217;m wondering about Banks- like Bank of America. They&amp;#8217;re not doing so hot, but are they going to pull a Bear Sterns   I hope. Energy (Alternative Energy) I&amp;#8217;ll cover in a minute, but I think that&amp;#8217;s a great sector to get in now that will only go up in 10-15 years ($$$$). Umm.. What else. . Oh, my Origin Oil - right now it&amp;#8217;s sitting at .46 cents. In a month it went up a hair shy of 300%. Triple your money!! I knew it, I just didn&amp;#8217;t have any money!!! Dang it! As soon as I get some play money I&amp;#8217;m going to seriously consider plopping it down on this and seeing where it is in a month.    There are different investing philosophies. At this moment I feel like I have two:    Find companies that will do great in a decade or two      like GE, FPL, or maybe UA (money I won&amp;#8217;t touch for a long time) Find stocks that are going to      have a great month or quarter. I think I may try being an active trader-      trade it in a month or two after I&amp;#8217;ve made a decent profit. Ex: If I bought OOIL at 35 cents and      sold it once it hit a buck or something, I dunno. That&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s scary to      me. If I see a volatile stock (which is this category) like OOIL increasing, it&amp;#8217;s tempting to cut bait and run with my 300% gain, but then      again, what if the stock goes up from 1 dollar to 5 dollars in a year or      two? Or what if it becomes a full fledged company and goes up to 11 bucks      or 30? Well what I think is I&amp;#8217;d get out cheap (a buck or so) and then if I      check on it a year or three later and it&amp;#8217;s a healthy, viable company      trading at 7, 10 bucks or something and I feel it&amp;#8217;ll only continue it&amp;#8217;s      upward trend, I&amp;#8217;ll buy back in.    So that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ll do. In my Roth IRA with Charles Schwab I&amp;#8217;ll invest in steady indexed mutual funds and the like, fund I know I can count on to retire on with relatively low risk. In my Scottrade account I&amp;#8217;ll buy and sell more volatile stocks to get my feet wet (my investing learner&amp;#8217;s permit as it were) while trying to make a bit of a profit taking it a month at a time (I say a month for two reasons- 1) it&amp;#8217;ll cost 14 bucks to buy and sell if I do it all at once (7 bucks per buy/sell), so it&amp;#8217;ll have to make a decent return to make it worth the cost. If I only earn 25 bucks that month only to lose most of the ground I gain in sell it?? So it would have to be like a 100 buck gain- a 20% gain a month would be cool. Then I&amp;#8217;d sell and be all smiles. 20% a month is causing you savvy investors to laugh. I know it&amp;#8217;s not going to happen&amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a goal is all I&amp;#8217;m saying. Dream the dream I say. It&amp;#8217;ll be money I don&amp;#8217;t NEED and can learn. Even if I lose my initial 500 bucks, I feel I&amp;#8217;ll learn a lot. That&amp;#8217;s why you start young- you can rebuild.   So I&amp;#8217;m still reading the Motley Fool Investment Guide. It&amp;#8217;s great. They suggest that when you start investing to start in a few comfortable domains. Start with what you know. If you work in the energy sector, you probably have a decent working knowledge of the industry and the different companies, which ones are going places, which ones are hurting- so start there! For example: My dad works for Baker Hughes Oil . During his career, oil did great as we all know, but is now hurting. There is currently a change in the wind and a lot of people are crying out for a change in our oil addiction. So in the next several years there&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge shift toward alternative fuels. Talking to my dad he thinks it would be wise to keep your eye on the energy sector. Check out T. Boone Pickens, oil companies are some of the leaders in developing alternative energy sources because they need to adapt to survive . GE is clearly an energy leader and could be a great investment to make. If I felt like FPL, a leader in wind power, is going to just go gangbusters in a decade when we try and use much more wind power, then I should buy low- buy now. Here in 15 years stocks in alternative energies could be great!   Anyways, everything you read tells you to start young. Time is on your side, they say. The power of compounding interest and dividends. It&amp;#8217;s true. If I stick in some money now when I&amp;#8217;m 24 and a few thou each year, I&amp;#8217;ll be sitting pretty.
