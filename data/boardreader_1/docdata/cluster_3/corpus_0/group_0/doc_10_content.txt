 Liner and non-linear modelsTwo examples of models that you have already ecountered in some detail are the SERAS CBA model and Lovelock&amp;apos;s Daisyworld model.(i) Which of these two models is a linear one, and which is non-linear?~SERAS is a linear model, although some of the data involved may be taken from non-linear sources.~Daisyworld is a simple non-linear model as one of the variables involved, temperature, is also dependent on the behaviour of the daisies.(ii) How would the output values for each of these models change with respect to changes in input values? (Try to visualise the types of graph outputs that you would get under different circumstances. What shape would they have?)~In SERAS, any change in input will produce a proportionate change in output, so a graph of input against output would probably be a straight line.~In Daisyworld, the model itself predicts the way output values change over time. Changes in input could produce any of the graph types shown in the Feedback model.
