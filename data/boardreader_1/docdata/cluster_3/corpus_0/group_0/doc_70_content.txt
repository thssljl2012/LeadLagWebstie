Beginning on August 1st, a new underwriting rule goes into effect to&amp;nbsp;halt the "buy-and-bail".&amp;nbsp;  Fannie and Freddie underwriting guidelines will require&amp;nbsp;that borrowers applying for a mortgage to purchase a property, and who already own another, must verify that they have at least 30% equity in the old property - or they can't get a loan. Countrywide has already instituted the new guideline, and is also applying&amp;nbsp;it towards FHA applicants as well.&amp;nbsp; This came into play on the Arthur deal, and as a result, we don't have a winner yet - but stay tuned, tomorrow is the day!&amp;nbsp; In an interesting twist, Countrywide is applying the rule towards FHA loans, and Bank of America is not - at least, not yet.
