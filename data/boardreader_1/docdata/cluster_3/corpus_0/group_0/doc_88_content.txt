  My bank, Westpac, has announced another rate rise for home loans.  The standard variable rate will be 9.61% from Thursday.  I know why they are doing it, so I can't really be angry with them, but it's killing my budget.  Which is, I suppose, exactly what it is meant to do, to tame the beast of inflation.  Bloody hell. I shall go back to my budget spreadsheet and see what the numbers look like.
