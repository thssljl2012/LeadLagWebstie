 MONEYSUPERMARKET.COMS share price rose 50% yesterday after it announced it had rejected a takeover approach.  The Deeside-based price comparison website firms share price had climbed steadily during the day before it confirmed Simon Nixon, its founder and chief executive, had received an unsolicited approach from an undisclosed source.  In a mid-afternoon statement, the company said: The board notes the recent movement in its share price and confirms an initial approach regarding a possible offer for the company was today made to Simon Nixon, the companys chief executive, in his capacity as 54% shareholder.  The approach did not contain indicative terms for any offer and has been rejected by Mr Nixon.  Shares in the FTSE-250 company climbed to 102.5p following the disclosure of the rejected offer, which valued the business at more than 500m. The shares later fell back to close at 84.25p, a 22% increase on the previous days close. The price remains just under half its 170p price when it floated last July.  Moneysupermarket.com has grown quickly in recent years but the price comparison website sector has become increasingly competitive, with a flurry of new entrants last year including gocompare.com and tescocompare.com, launched by retailer Tesco.  Earlier this month Moneysupermarket issued a trading statement warning that revenues would be down by 7m following the withdrawal of Barclays-owned Firstplus from the home loans sector, while underlying earnings would fall by up to 5m.  Analyst David McCann at Numis Securities said: It is a market leader in the UK and probably globally, in terms of the competences, technology, knowledge and experience. That does make it attractive to a lot of people.  It doesnt look like the company rejected it on price because a price wasn't offered. This doesn't mean they won't sell out, he said.
