This from a &amp;#8220;30year veteran of the bond market. My career began at the Open Market Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the significant majority of the subsequent years were spent&amp;nbsp; trading (Treasuries) or selling high grade fixed income product for some of the largest primary dealer firms&amp;#8221; The situation is grim: Endgame?, by Tim Duy: News is flowing in faster than the ability to process the implications.&amp;nbsp; When I went to bed Saturday night, the only sure thing looked like the liquidation of Lehman Monday morning.&amp;nbsp; A scant 24 hours later, to that liquidation is added the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and, later the possibility of a collapse of AIG by midweek.&amp;nbsp; The Fed and Treasury suddenly play hardball, and the floodgates break open.
