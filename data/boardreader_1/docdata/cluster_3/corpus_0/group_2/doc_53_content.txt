CAMPAIGNING across Florida over the weekend Barack Obama, using the Wall Street meltdown as a theme, pounded John McCain on Social Security and health care concerns.   Given the state&amp;#8217;s huge elderly population Obama reminded Floridians that McCain had backed President Bush&amp;#8217;s effort to let Americans invest Social Security benefits in the stock and bond markets.   Had the plan succeeded, Obama said, millions last week would have watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes.&amp;#8221;   More to the point an increasingly aggressive Obama expanded his criticism of McCain&amp;#8217;s suggestion, buried in an actuarial industry publication, that health care can be deregulated, like banking.   &amp;#8220;&amp;#8221;And here&amp;#8217;s the really scary part. Now this &amp;#8220;Great Deregulator&amp;#8221; wants to turn his attention to health care.&amp;#8221;   He mentioned McCain&amp;#8217;s article, Better Health Care at Lower Cost for Every American, in the Sept. /Oct. issue of Contingencies, the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries, about the wonders of market-based health care reform:   &amp;#8220;Opening up the health insurance market to a more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the past decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&amp;#8221;      Also on Saturday the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who writes about economics, said: &amp;#8220;So McCain, who now poses as the scourge of Wall Street, was praising financial deregulation like 10 seconds ago &amp;#8211; and promising that if we marketize health care, it will perform as well as the financial industry!&amp;#8221;    Caveat emptor.
