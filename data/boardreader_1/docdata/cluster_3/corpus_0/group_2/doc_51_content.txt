 If you&amp;#8217;ve been living under a rock you might want to catch up on whats been going on in the U.S. Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Company Inc. was the third largest US investment bank and was also a global financial services firm. It survived wars, the Great Depression- but couldn&amp;#8217;t survive the mortgage destruction in mid-2007. On Sept.14.2008 is announced that it would sell itself to Bank of America for $44 billion. Thats like business prostitution. If Merrill didn&amp;#8217;t sell itself, it would have ended up like the Leham Brothers: Bankrupt. Fact: The economy is rapidly plunging down and taking the big dogs with it.
