mccain on banking and health care  Here is what McCain's ideas for market-based health reform which is similar to what he supported for the privatization of Social Security!    Quote:                    Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.                McCain, who now suddenly claims to want to regulate Wall Street, having been struck and enlightened by God and saw the light on the road to Damascus, was praising financial deregulation day before yesterday  and promising that if we marketize health care, it will perform as well as the financial industry!  :omg: :omg: :omg:
