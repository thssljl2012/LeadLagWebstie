We have just lived through what some analysts say is a 'historic day in financial history'.In a single day, Lehman Brothers, one of America's largest investment backs with a rich history dating back several decades filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, marking the end of bank that prided itself in financial innovation. Within the same few hours of the bankruptcy announcement, Bank of America announced that it was acquiring the other once-mighty American investment bank, Merrill Lynch.Reading the newspapers of the world, it is really hard to see any joy in all the doom and gloom that the markets are creating. Some are comparing this financial crisis with the Great Depression of the 1920s, others are saying that this is a 1-in-a-100 years phenomenon. All that is certain..sadly...is uncertainty...uncertainty of what tomorrow will bring, and uncertainty as to just how much more the world has to endure in terms of this financial contagion.In times like this, it is important to keep stock of what we have. In turmoil and uncertainty, there are a few things we should try to keep as constant - love, faith and hope - love for those we love and those who love and depend on us, faith in God and in the good foundations we have laid in the past and continue to lay each day, and hope for a brighter tomorrow.
