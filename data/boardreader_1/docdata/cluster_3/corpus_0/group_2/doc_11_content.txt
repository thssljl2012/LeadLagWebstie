 How is it possible to see any upside in the takeover, overnight, by Lloyds TSB of HBOS? How is it possible to happen? It&amp;#8217;s a fucking total and utter calamity. It&amp;#8217;s of gargantuan proportions and I feel much more than sad about it: much more. In fact I feel really, really angry.  I will refer you to my POV about Lehman and their total fuckfest of Monday morning as evidence. But it was an inevitability that something like this was going to happen, not necessarily to HBOS but to one of the big ones, because the whole shoddy, greedy, badly processed, managed, organised and risk-assesed fuckola was rank. And, as soon as you dig down it was HBOS that was by far the most at risk as the UK&amp;#8217;s biggest mortgage lender. I don&amp;#8217;t know the facts here, but we were all disgusted at mortgage mutiples of 5 and 6 were made available to the market (weren&amp;#8217;t we - as middle class blog writer/readers?) and obviously HBOS, as market leader, had to be engaging in this behaviour: to protect its market share: not its business: its market share. Come on guys. Who cares a flying fuck about market share if it destroys margin and profit?  Market share?  Market fucking schmare. It&amp;#8217;s vanity. The outcome though has little or no upside for me.  Alex Salmond has a real challenge on his hands.  Yes, we all know that HBOS&amp;#8217; Scottish HO status was a Halifax sop, but people forget. This is a serious fucking up of Scotland&amp;#8217;s commercial status. I&amp;#8217;m really, really pissed off. You should be too. Oh yeah and the fact that the outcome is next door to a monoply. &amp;#8220;What fucking ever&amp;#8221; says the Government. Sheesh. Is this Gordon Brown&amp;#8217;s legacy coming back to bite him? I think so. And who&amp;#8217;s left to explain it? Alastair fucking Darling. What a joke.
