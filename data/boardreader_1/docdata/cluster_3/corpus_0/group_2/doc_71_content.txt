Here is the transcript for the Sean Hannity interview with Sarah Palin. Amazing the difference in interview techniques. No attack agenda, unlike the Gibbons interview. Part 1: This is a rush transcript from &amp;#8220;Hannity &amp;amp; Colmes,&amp;#8221; September 17, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST:She is the politician who has taken America by storm and who has changed the very dynamic of the presidential race. Governor Sarah Palin has been the target of left-wing smears and conservative adoration as she was introduced as Senator McCain&amp;#8217;s running mate nearly three weeks ago. Now, earlier today, we met her in Cleveland, Ohio for a no-topic-off- limit interview that last almost a full hour. Tonight, in part one, the governor discusses the current crisis on Wall Street, what her role will be in a McCain administration, and what we have to do as a country to secure our energy independence. And we even got a reaction to the &amp;#8220;Saturday Night Live&amp;#8221; skit that everyone is talking about. She saw it, too. And her response, well, it may surprise you. Also, Karl Rove will join us tonight with reaction and a representative of the Obama campaign will also be here to respond. But we start tonight with Governor Palin herself in a &amp;#8220;Hannity &amp;amp; Colmes&amp;#8221; exclusive interview: HANNITY:Governor, thank you for being with us. GOV. SARAH PALIN, VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:Thank you so much. HANNITY:All right. You said when you were asked to be Senator McCain&amp;#8217;s running mate that you didn&amp;#8217;t hesitate, you didn&amp;#8217;t blink. Tell us about the call, when that came. PALIN:Well, I found out about the actual selection just a couple of days before you guys all did. Getting that nod was quite an experience, of course, because I knew that Senator McCain and his team had been doing a heck of a lot of research and vetting of many names. So, of course, it&amp;#8217;s the utmost honor is what I felt when he actually said, do you want to help me do this? And I said, absolutely. Let&amp;#8217;s get in there and let&amp;#8217;s reform. We&amp;#8217;ll shake some things up. But we start tonight with Governor Palin herself in a &amp;#8220;Hannity &amp;amp; Colmes&amp;#8221; exclusive interview: HANNITY:Governor, thank you for being with us. GOV. SARAH PALIN, VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:Thank you so much. HANNITY:All right. You said when you were asked to be Senator McCain&amp;#8217;s running mate that you didn&amp;#8217;t hesitate, you didn&amp;#8217;t blink. Tell us about the call, when that came.

We&amp;#8217;ll shake some things up. HANNITY:What was your family&amp;#8217;s reaction? Was there time to huddle and have a hockey team meeting? PALIN:It was a time of asking the girls to vote on it, anyway. And they voted unanimously, yes. Didn&amp;#8217;t bother asking my son because, you know, he&amp;#8217;s going to be off doing his thing anyway, so he wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so impacted by, at least, the campaign period here. So asked the girls what they thought and they&amp;#8217;re like, absolutely. Let&amp;#8217;s do this, mom. HANNITY:Let&amp;#8217;s talk about, Governor, obviously, the economy is on the minds of many Americans. We&amp;#8217;ve got Lehman, we&amp;#8217;ve got Merrill, we&amp;#8217;ve got AIG. Senator Barack Obama yesterday was attacking Senator McCain for saying that the &amp;#8220;fundamentals of the economy are strong.&amp;#8221; Do you believe that the fundamentals of our economy are strong? PALIN:Well, it was an unfair attack on the verbiage that Senator McCain chose to use because the fundamentals, as he was having to explain afterwards, he means our workforce, he means the ingenuity of the American. And of course, that is strong and that is the foundation of our economy. So that was an unfair attack there, again, based on verbiage that John McCain used. Certainly it is a mess though, the economy is a mess. And there have been abuses on Wall Street and that adversely affects Main Street. And it&amp;#8217;s that commitment that John McCain is articulating today, getting in there, reforming the way that Wall Street has been allowed to work, stopping the abuses and that violation of the public trust that too many CEOs and top management of some of these companies, that abuse there has got to stop. It is, somebody was saying this morning, a toxic waste there on Wall Street, affecting Main Street. And we&amp;#8217;ve got to cure this. HANNITY:Through reform? PALIN:Through reform, absolutely. Look at the oversight that has been lax, I believe, here it&amp;#8217;s a 1930s type of regulatory regime overseeing some of these corporations. And we&amp;#8217;ve got to get a more coordinated and a much more stringent oversight regime. Not that government is going to be solely looked to for the answers in all of the problems in Wall Street, but government can play a very, very appropriate role in the oversight as people are trusting these companies with their life savings, with their investments, with their insurance policies and construction bonds and everything else. When we see the collapse that we&amp;#8217;re seeing today, you know that something is broke and John McCain has a great plan to get in there and fix it. HANNITY:Is Senator Obama then using what happened on Wall Street this week? Is he using it for political gain? Is there a danger of a presidential candidate is saying to the world that America&amp;#8217;s situation of economic crisis is the worst that we&amp;#8217;ve seen in decades  which was words that he was using yesterday  is there a danger in terms of the world hearing that? PALIN:Well, there is a danger in allowing some obsessive partisanship to get into the issue that we&amp;#8217;re talking about today. And that&amp;#8217;s something that John McCain too, his track record, proving that he can work both sides of the aisle, he can surpass the partisanship that must surpassed to deal with an issue like this. It is that profound and that important an issue that we work together on this and not just let one party try to kind of grab it all or capture it all and pretend like they have all the answers. It&amp;#8217;s going to take everybody working together on this. HANNITY:Who is responsible for these failing institutions, in your view? PALIN:I think the corruption on Wall Street  that is to blame. And that violation of the public trust. And that contract that should be inherent in corporations who are spending, investing other people&amp;#8217;s money  the abuse of that is what has got to stop. And it&amp;#8217;s a matter, too, of some of these CEOs and top management people and shareholders too not holding that management accountable, being addicted to, we call it, OPM  O-P-M, &amp;#8220;other people&amp;#8217;s money.&amp;#8221; Spending that, investing that, not using the prudence that we expect of them. But here again, government has got to play an appropriate role in the stringent oversight, making sure that those abuses stop. HANNITY:Well, you know, both you and Senator McCain supported the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. You both opposed the bailout of government intervention as it relates to Lehman or Merrill. But now we read this morning that AIG is going to get some type of government bailout. Was that the right call? PALIN:Well, you know, first, Fannie and Freddie, different because quasi-government agencies there where government had to step in because of the adverse impacts all across our nation, especially with homeowners. It&amp;#8217;s just too impacting, we had to step in there. I do not like the idea though of taxpayers being used to bailout these corporations. Today it was AIG, important call there, though, because of the construction bonds and the insurance carrier duties of AIG. But first and foremost, taxpayers cannot be looked to as the bailout, as the solution to the problems on Wall Street. HANNITY:How connected is it, though, to Washington? You have 354 lawmakers got money from Fannie and Freddie  354. If you look at the years from 1989 to 2008, the second top recipient was Senator Barack Obama. Should there be an investigation in terms of the relationship between the political donations and then, of course, the bankruptcy that ensued and the impact on the economy? PALIN:I think that&amp;#8217;s significant, but even more significant is the role that the lobbyists play in an issue like this also. And in that cronyism  it&amp;#8217;s symptomatic of the greater problem that we see right now in Washington and that is just that acceptance of the status quo, the politics as usual, the cronyism that has been allowed to be accepted and then it leads us to a position like we are today with so much collapse on Wall Street. That&amp;#8217;s the reform that we&amp;#8217;ve got to get in there and make sure that this happens. We&amp;#8217;ve got to put government and these regulatory agencies back on the side of the people. It&amp;#8217;s what John McCain and I  we have very consistent track records showing that we&amp;#8217;re capable and we&amp;#8217;re willing to do this. Ruffling feathers along the way, but it&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;re expected to do and what we&amp;#8217;re promising to do. HANNITY:You&amp;#8217;ve talked about  Senator McCain has talked about  you want to eliminate earmarks, that you want to reduce government spending, that you want to keep taxes low, you want to reform government. You&amp;#8217;ve used to the term reform a lot  Senator McCain has used the term reform a lot. Many people have gone to Washington and they&amp;#8217;ve made these promises, especially when it comes to cutting spending and it doesn&amp;#8217;t h...
