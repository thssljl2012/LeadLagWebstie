Ok, so putting aside the fact that the Government has just waived perfectly good and sound competition rules to make this deal happen (presumably firms will wait until future crises to make takeovers, judging the likelihood of Government cave in to be highly probable), the numbers are quite interesting.  Lloyds TSB has unveiled details of its 12.2bn takeover of HBOS, a deal it described as a "unique opportunity". The deal values shares in Halifax Bank of Scotland - the UK's biggest mortgage lender - at 232p each, and could lead to cost savings of 1bn a year.  Lloyds confirmed jobs would be lost as a result, but played down claims that up to 40,000 staff faced the axe So 1bn savings; About 1,000 branches to close; and a large number of job losses. Assuming each branch costs, what?, 100,000pa to keep open (rent, rates, maintenance, heating, lighting, etc), that equates to about 100m. 900m for 40,000 people equates to 22,500 per employee cost (sounds a bit low, once HR, Employers NIC, Pensions, Health &amp; Safety, and God knows what other nonsense ads to the cost of employing people are all taken into account). But let's take the 40,000 people figure. This is one giant productivity gain. Lloyds and HBOS have a combined workforce of 142,000, so delivering the same service with 40,000 less people and 1bn less costs (That's about 0.06% of GDP in savings?) must be statistically significant and so reflected in the next productivity stats? Or have I got my numbers horrendously wrong?
