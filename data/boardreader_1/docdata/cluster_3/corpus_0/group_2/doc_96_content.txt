Talk about timing. &amp;nbsp;John McCain continues his terrible week, this time talking healthcare. &amp;nbsp;Paul Krugman points us to McCain's distorted view of what we need in the way of healthcare reforms:Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.Krugman then offers his own analysis:So McCain, who now poses as the scourge of Wall Street, was praising financial deregulation like 10 seconds ago - and promising that if we marketize health care, it will perform as well as the financial industry!I wonder if the NJ GOP candidates for office agree with their party's standard bearer, who wants the healthcare industry to operate more like the financial industry? &amp;nbsp;I guess since we have seen all those government bailouts in the financial industry this week, it's safe to say they now support taxpayer funded healthcare? Who knew.
