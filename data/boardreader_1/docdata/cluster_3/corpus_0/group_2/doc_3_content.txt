This morning in Jacksonville, Florida John McCain stated: "You know that there's been tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall St. And it is -- people are frightened by these events. Our economy, I think still -- the fundamentals of our economy are strong. But these are very, very difficult times."Really? Then why did Lehman Brothers just file for bankruptcy last night and the largest American stock broker, Merrill Lynch, just hand itself over to Bank of America for protection from the economy? Why has the number of Americans with jobs declined significantly every month in 2008? Why have three houses on my short block been for sale since March with no buyers looking at them?Does the phrase "fundamentals of our economy" have any meaning to a 72-year-old guy who is married to a wealthy beer distributorship heiress and who owns somewhere between seven and ten houses in four compounds and who flies everywhere in his wife's private jet? Or is he just mouthing sweet nothings in the voter's ears in order to gain the power of the Presidency no matter what he has to say or do to get it?McCain really is just like Bush. Now they share the same bubble and the same ignorance. Only McCain also adds his age, years of boxing and heavy drinking, and his five and a half years of torture and privation as a POW to the mix. No one who reads the newspapers today could honestly think that the "Fundamentals of our economy are strong" unless they were losing their mind or being lied to - or both.
