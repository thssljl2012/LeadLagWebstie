Now that we&amp;#8217;ve dealt with the morning&amp;#8217;s news churn, let&amp;#8217;s return to the Meltdown on Wall Street, where the Fed has agreed to lend up to $85 billion to bailout AIG, and Lehman employees are cheering after Barclays, in a bold move, announced it would buy the bulk of the firm for $1.75 billion.  Lehman bonuses? Not so fast: The NLJ reports that Lehman&amp;#8217;s Chapter 11 filing could feature a challenge to executive bonuses on the ground that they were fraudulent transfers made by an ailing company. Lehman&amp;#8217;s filing lists assets of $639 billion and pegs debt at $613 billion, but creditors may question 2007 bonuses paid near the end of last year, attorneys said. Lehman paid about $5.7 billion in bonuses, which are typically 60% of compensation, according to a December Bloomberg News story. &amp;#8220;When significant payments [are made] to insiders within a year of the filing, it&amp;#8217;s heavily scrutinized,&amp;#8221; Steve Jakubowski, of the Coleman Law Firm in Chicago, told the NLJ. One question, says Jakubowski, is whether Lehman gave its employees more than the value of their services at a time when the company was insolvent or undercapitalized, he said. Neither Lehman nor its bankruptcy lawyer, Weil Gotshal&amp;#8217;s Harvey Miller, immediately returned the NLJ&amp;#8217;s calls for comment. Cleary lands Barclays; Davis Polk takes care of the Fed: Cleary partners Victor Lewkow, Lindsee Granfield, David Leinwand, Duane McLaughlin, Meme Peponis, Lisa Schweitzer and Steve Wilner advised Barclays in its deal to buy Lehman&amp;#8217;s North American business, which, according to the WSJ, will include most of its people, franchise, brand name, technology and clients, but not the risky trades and liabilities that had hurt Lehman in the markets before its bankruptcy filing. Meanwhile, uptown, Davis Polk&amp;#8217;s Bradley Smith, Marshall Huebner, Donald Bernstein, Robert Heckart and Ethan James advised the Fed in its bailout of AIG. Also, the Lawyer reports that a S&amp;#038;C team led by Rodgin Cohen is advising AIG.   Will plaintiffs lawyers be the big losers in the AIG bailout? The AmLaw Daily&amp;#8217;s Andrew Longstreth (link unavailable) urges us, in the wake of the AIG bailout, to consider the plight of Labaton Sucharow&amp;#8217;s Thomas Dubbs, whose firm is lead counsel in a securities class action against AIG. It has fought hard in the case, beating back AIG&amp;#8217;s motion to dismiss and preparing class certification motions. Labaton expected big returns when it filed the case in 2004. AIG&amp;#8217;s stock was then trading north of $55 per share. Yesterday it closed at under $4. Even though the the Fed agreed to loan AIG $85 billion so it could avoid bankruptcy, the plaintiffs will almost certainly be forced to settle for less than they&amp;#8217;d once hoped, writes Longstreth.    The Federal Reserve building in Washington, Sept. 16, 2008. (AP/Charles Dharapak)   Fed dusts off rarely-invoked legal authority: Our friends over at the Real Time Economic blog note that, in lending up to $85 billion at a hefty interest rate to AIG, the Federal Reserve once again relied on its rarely used legal authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to lend to non-banks in unusual and exigent circumstance, provided the borrower is unable to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions. Until its loan to Bear Stearns in March, the Fed hadnt used that lending authority since the Great Depression, reports Real Time Economics.
