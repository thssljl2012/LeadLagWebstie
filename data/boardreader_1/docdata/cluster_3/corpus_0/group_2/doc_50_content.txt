Washington, D.C.Alongside former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and current economic bad-ass and University of Chicago economics professor slash Nobel prize winner Gary Becker (no, not that bad Ted Danson sitcom from a few years back) the Ted Lilly Fan Club today announced that they will halt all their inane, Ted Lilly-focused commentary for the time being to focus on the financial crisis.Now is not the time for us to be making random allusions to Greek mythology, quasi-obscure 80s pop culture and TL's weirdly perfect abs, said the Ted Lilly Fan Club. We need to come together as a Chicago Cubs Blog Community (CCBC) and help solve our nations financial crisis. We call on other Cubs blogs, like Cub Reporter, Bleed Cubbie Blue and A League of Her Own to do the same. We solemnly ask: If not Cubs blogs, then who?In addition to taking a stronger stance in the public affairs arena, the TLFC has also taken steps to use its gigantic cash reserves to help prod the market into stabilization by making a $5 billion dollar investment in Warren Buffett who just made a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs. Do the math: the numbers work.This, of course, comes on the heels of last week when the TLFC shockingly announced a capital infusion and option to purchase plan for veritable, yet beleaguered, Investment Bank Lehman Brothers for an undisclosed, but nominal, sum."At the time, the TLFC said, "We've been looking to add to our portfolio as the Fan Club for a Adonis- like core, left throwing, bad ass pitcher for a National League Central Champion team and transform ourself into a financial services and asset management powerhouse; Lehman fit our goals," said TLFC, "Ted's growing popularity, future no hitter slash World Series MVP, will provide cost savings and synergies and whatever buzz words you can think of--'e-solutions', 'glass ceiling'--whatever. "After TLFC ultimately declined the opportunity, Barclays swooped in for sloppy seconds.Of course, this self-imposed blog blackout probably will only last until Saturday when Ted Lilly takes to the mound against the Brewers but, til then, TLFC: Change You Can Believe In.http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheTedLillyFanClub
