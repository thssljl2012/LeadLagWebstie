Good morning and good Monday. Well, not really. In case you&amp;#8217;ve kept the computer off all weekend or, like me, you spent Sunday watching the Giants win and the Jets - damn it - lose their home opener, here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s happening: Wall Street is in chaos.  Lehman Brothers, burdened by $60 billion in soured real-estate holdings, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection because no one wants to buy them. And Bank of America is going to buy Merrill Lynch for a cool$50 billion all-stock transaction. To make matters worse, New York&amp;#8217;s American International Group Inc., the largest insurer in the world, is being forced into a restructuring. How wide will the ripple be? Here is a one-stop spot for everyone to keep track of a few Long Island banks and thrifts. Click on the company name to see where the stock is at this moment. Astoria Financial opened at $20.97. New York Community Bancorp is at $17.29. Bank of Smithtown, trading far closer to a 52-week low, opened this morning at $17.52. First of Long Island is at $22. That bank has stayed within a tight range for the last year. Here is the link to track Capital One and Washington Mutual, two other banks with a big presence on Long Island. Capital One bought out North Fork Bank nearly two years ago and is the biggest bank based on deposits in Nassau-Suffolk. Hold on to your hat &amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s going to be a bumpy Monday.
