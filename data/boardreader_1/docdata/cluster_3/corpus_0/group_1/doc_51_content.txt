Friday night, the end of the working week, and it's supposed to be satisfying as an end to what can be a less than relaxing undertaking. Normally, I look forward to the Friday evening, a beer or three, a read of Snowy's remembrances and a surf through the virtual world.Tonight, I'm feeling just a tad dissatisfied ....well, a LOT dissatisfied actually. The week gone was one of the slackest weeks business-wise I think I've had in my current role as an office-bound business development person for a mortgage manager/originator. The whole office dealt with two new applications during the week, and I had nothing new come through my email or over the phone. In other places &amp;amp; other times, I'd not have been concerned in the least, but in the current economic and financial climate, I'm very uneasy. No business for a non-bank financial institution (NBFI) means losses because there's always loan accounts running off the back of the book through payouts, refinances and just plain ordinary repayments. It's essential for a mortgage origination business to keep an inflow going, and right now, with banks re-taking the ascendancy in the domestic financial marketplace, that inflow has slowed to a weak drip.The quality of the business is very, very poor as well, which means that what deals we are getting, are extremely hard to find funders for. The defaulters, arrears merchants, optimistic buyers with no equity and gullible investors sold a line on property they can't afford to buy, let alone pay interest on. Money is expensive when you're not a major player and major players are banks. In the main, the Pillars and lesser institutions like St George Bank, HSBC, Bendigo Bank. Those close to the source and with the capital adequacy to buy money at better rates than non-banks.There is a way to stay alive, for the NBFI's during these hard times, and that way is to shed staff. The real assets of any business, which are almost without exception, treated as liabilities. Cost centres. For me, because I said I couldn't possibly live on $45k/annum, and said $50k was my basement level, I had to sign onto a six month probationary period in April. This means I'm not permanent staff, and won't be until 18 October this year. 180 days. I'm more than willing to wager real money that I'll get the bullet on day 179. The plus for me is that during the probationary period, while I can be dismissed at 24 hours notice, I can also walk away at 24 hours notice. Have to have somewhere to walk to first though. I've been working on that for the last month or six weeks and have something which is giving every impression of coming off. I just wish it would gel so I can get this 'fear and loathing' simian off my back.I go to work each day, do my utmost to encourage business relationships with brokers, make myself available, even make personal, individual visits at my own cost from time to time. I write a two page, professional-looking newsletter for the business each month, and help out the permanent Business Development Manager whenever possible, yet I know very well that I'm as expendable as everyone else. More so, because I'm not permanent. The vibes are always evident, which makes each day feel like the last one and I no longer enjoying either the work, or my Friday nights. Even with a beer or three. I like the people I work with. In fact, if the gig I'm working on gelling solidifies, I'll miss them all terribly, but number one comes first. Actually, numbers one and two because I'm after something better for the benefit of both Rabble &amp;amp; myself. I'm fifty-one in a few weeks. I reckon I have, or would prefer to have, a maximum of fourteen years left in me, working. I'd like to enjoy a little time at ease before I shuffle off, so finding something solid, satisfying and reasonably well paid is vital to finding that ease down the track a-ways.I find myself wondering what's going to happen first. Will I walk, or be walked? How long before I know? How long is that string?           Read and post comments            Send to a friend
