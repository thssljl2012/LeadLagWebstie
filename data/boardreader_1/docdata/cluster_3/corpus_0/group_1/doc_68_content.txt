 Chrysler refinancing falls short by $6bnBy Nicole Bullock in New York and John Reed in LondonCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2008Published: August 4 2008 19:35   Last updated: August 5 2008 01:28Confidence in US vehicle makers remained shaken on Monday as the credit markets continued to punish the sector.The latest sign of scepticism about the financial health of the Detroit Three came from a refinancing by Chryslers lending arm. Late on Sunday, the vehicle maker revealed it had only been able to refinance $24bn of a $30bn one-year credit facility that was expiring.In volatile trading on Monday, the cost of buying insurance against a debt default on General Motors and Ford rose to new highs. Dealers said the prices that were being demanded indicated a chance of default upwards of 85 per cent on GM and about 75 per cent on Ford over five years.GM last week reported a second-quarter net loss of $15.5bn, one of the worst in its 100-year history, due to plunging vehicle sales and high restructuring costs. Its earnings were also hit by losses at GMAC, the financial-services arm it co-owns with buy-out group Cerberus, and Delphi, its former parts division.The rapidly eroding picture for autos represents the consequence of high oil prices and declining consumer confidence, and the prospects for another round of significant auto sector dislocation eclipsing the 2005 woes become increasingly clear, said Jeffrey Rosenberg, credit strategist at Bank of America.After one month of tough negotiations, Chrysler this past weekend ended up with $24bn of funding when some banks declined to extend additional credit to the vehicle maker. Chrysler also took a reduced amount relative to the original $30bn facility to account for its decision to pull out of the lease business.The credit facility funds retail car loans and dealer financing. Chrysler, the smallest of Americas three Detroit-area vehicle makers, last month said that it would stop offering leases on its vehicles due to plunging residual values of off-lease vehicles and the more difficult climate in the securitisation markets. Chrysler was taken private last year by Cerberus Capital Management.Tom Gilman, executive vice-chairman of Chrysler Financial, said: Ninety per cent of all banks that were part of the original conduit participated in the renewal. The liquidity provided by these facilities will enable us to support our dealers and their retail customers.JPMorgan, Citigroup and Royal Bank of Scotland co-ordinated the refinancing. Of the more than 20 banks in the original consortium, Bank of America and Calyon did not participate in the refinancing, people familiar with the deal said.Bank of America and Calyon declined to comment.The banks who did participate demanded higher interest rates than those Chrysler had paid in the original $30bn facility.
