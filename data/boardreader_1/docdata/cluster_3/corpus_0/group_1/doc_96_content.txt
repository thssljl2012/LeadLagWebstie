 Barclays unloads 6.3bn troubled debtBy Peter Thal Larsen and Jane CroftCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2008Published: August 7 2008 07:30   Last updated: August 7 2008 21:02Barclays has offloaded troubled loans and securities worth 6.3bn during the past few months in a sign that investors have become more willing to buy debt assets affected by the credit crunch.Barclays executives said on Thursday that most of the sales, which included mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, had been agreed in May and June. Deals were at prices consistent with valuations on Barclays balance sheet and did not require the bank to provide financing.The disposals are further evidence that banks are more able to shift debt securities, most of which have been stuck on their balance sheets since the credit crisis first struck last summer.Risk transfer has begun, Bob Diamond, Barclays president, said on Thursday. Even difficult assets  even mortgage assets  are moving to new buyers.Last month Merrill Lynch sold collateralised debt obligations with a nominal value of more than $30bn (15bn) to Lone Star, the US private equity group, at about 22 per cent of face value. In May UBS, the Swiss bank, sold mortgage securities with a face value of $22bn to BlackRock, the asset management group. In each case the banks helped finance the purchase.Barclays reported it had written down the value of complex debt securities on its balance sheet by 2.8bn in the first half. The writedown, partly offset by an 852m gain from revaluing the banks own debt, was largely responsible for the fall in first-half pre-tax profits, down 33 per cent to 2.75bn.Barclays has faced questions about the valuation of debt securities on its balance sheet. The sales included the financing of about 2.3bn of loans backing the private equity buy-out of Alltel, the US telecoms group. Alltel has since been sold to Verizon, its US rival, which redeemed the debts.Barclays has also sold whole subprime-mortgage loans worth 828m, Alt-A mortgages worth 750m and commercial mortgages worth 700m.Barclays seized the opportunity to expand its mortgage business in the first half, bolstering a surprisingly robust performance in its home market.The bank mopped up 26 per cent of net new mortgage lending  a sharp rise from the 6 per cent it took in the first half of 2007.This is all the more surprising because until recently Barclays had been losing market share in home loans.Barclays only started to see its mortgage lending figures improve in late 2006 when it made the decision to tackle its botched acquisition of Woolwich, the former building society, and integrate it more fully within Barclays.But the fallout from the credit crunch has really allowed Barclays to accelerate its mortgage lending at a time when weaker rivals have withdrawn from the market or lacked the capital to write new business.We have been wide open for business and we have written new business with low loan to values, said Frits Seegers, head of global retail and commercial banking, on Thursday.Barclays made the point that its new mortgage business is high quality with an average loan to value ratio on new lending of 51 per cent. It added that 7 per cent of its 77bn loan book had a loan to value ratio above 80 per cent, while a further 7 per cent is in riskier buy-to-let loans.The growth spurt in mortgages helped Barclays retail bank report pre-tax profits up 7 per cent to 690m.Barclaycard, the UKs biggest credit card provider, also did much better. Pre-tax profits here jumped 30 per cent to 388m helped by its international expansion. Barclaycard is now the third-largest credit card issuer in India, for example.The credit card business, which saw a sharp rise in bad debts in the past three years, started to rein back its lending to customers in 2006 and now rejects one in two of new applicants.Mr Seegers said Barclaycards caution over the past few years was paying off. He said: One of my first decisions was to tighten lending criteria and we have reaped the benefits of that decision in terms of controlled impairments.Bad debts in the business rose to 477m for the first half of this year  compared with 435m in 2007  but this was because of Barclaycards recent acquisition of Goldfish. Excluding acquisitions, bad debts fell. Barclays commercial bank, which lends to businesses, saw profits flat at 702m, in spite of growth in customer assets.Analysts cautioned that the deteriorating economy posed risks to the expanding consumer lending franchise.The UK business has done fine although the bank can expect higher bad debts if there is a recession, said Sandy Chen, analyst at Panmure Gordon.Bruno Paulson, analyst at Bernstein, said: Interestingly, the impairments on UK retail customers have yet to rise much, with both UK retail and Barclaycard (excluding Goldfish) seeing roughly flat impairments, he said.Provisions are rising at Barclays foreign retail and commercial operations. Overall, international provisions rose threefold to 294m, as bad debts rose in Spain and South Africa.But Barclays expanding emerging markets operations should help offset any deterioration in the UK market.A quarter of profits in the division run by Mr Seegers now come from outside the UK and this proportion will increase.
