A grand jury has returned a 40-count indictment against seven people accused of running a mortgage fraud scheme in Seattle's suburbs.  Those charged include the operators of Kobay Financial Corp., Nationwide Home Lending and Emerald City Escrow, all of Bellevue. The indictment says they used straw buyers or other unqualified buyers with vastly overstated incomes to artificially inflate home values and acquire more than $46 million in mortgages from ING and Washington Mutual banks, among others.  Nationwide, which is not affiliated with Nationwide Lending Corp. or Nationwide Mutual Insurance, closed last fall.  The indictment alleges the defendants took $9 million for themselves, using the money to buy luxury cars and boats, among other things. The straw buyers were paid for their participation.  The charges include conspiracy, as well as bank, mail and wire fraud.  Defendants are Vladislav Baydovskiy and Viktor Kobzar, who ran Kobay, and their employee Camie Byron; Alla Sobol, who ran Nationwide; David Sobol and Donata Baydovskiy, who ran Emerald City; and Sandra Thorpe, a bookkeeper who allegedly prepared false letters verifying employment for buyers.  Four of the defendants were arrested Thursday and are scheduled to make initial appearances in U.S. District Court later in the day.
