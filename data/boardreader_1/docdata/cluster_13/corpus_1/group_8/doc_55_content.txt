Someone shoot me! AHHHHH MONICA! AHHHHHHH! That was very hard to listen too, truly.  Tuesday, March 3, 2009 by Peter  NOT true! We need the renovation- to KEEP NAIAS in Michigan- Come on a vote against NAIAS is a vote against the innovation we need to keep Detroit alive and an international city. What a shame, Monica, what a total, sad shame-  Tuesday, March 3, 2009 by Katie  I found Moncia Conyers opinions and insights very credible and I support her posture...  I also agree with her that the 'stimulus funds' can be used for COBO . Clearly todate we have funded AIG, BA, CITI Bank and other billions of $$$ . I am quite sure these funds can be use for COBO..I would hope the BIG 3 also back the city on the 'stimulus funds given the upgrades assist them and the auto show!!!  Tuesday, March 3, 2009 by Thrasher  According to Council President Conyers, stimulus funds can be used for the renovation of Cobo Hall. Does Madame Conyers have a way for the City of Detroit to sustain and maintain Cobo after that happens? Maybe she knows of a way to do that also. She seems to have information that isn't privy to everyone else!  Wednesday, March 4, 2009 by Shirl  The stimulus funds will stimulate a number of options and avenues to sustan and maintain COBO. I have faith is her fiscal analysis of the COBO issue..I am not alone either so do the majority of the Detroit CC as well..  Thursday, March 5, 2009 by Thrasher
