The remembrance will be held at noon in the House Chamber, where Mr. Keverian served as a lawmaker for a quarter century, and where he presided as speaker from 1985 until he left the post in 1990 to seek the Democratic nomination for state treasurer. After the ceremony, his body will lie in state from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. in Memorial Hall, also known as the Hall of Flags, at the State House. Current and former lawmakers, governors, and other dignitaries are expected, and the public is encouraged to attend, said Dusty Rhodes, the Boston event planner who is helping to organize the memorial. Rhodes is Mr. Keverian's niece by marriage. Prior to the State House remembrance, a wake will be held Tuesday from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Holy Trinity Armenian Apostolic Church of Greater Boston, at 145 Brattle St. in Cambridge. The Cambridge church will also be the site of Mr. Keverian's funeral service, which will be held Thursday at 11 a.m. Burial will follow at Glenwood Cemetery in Everett. In lieu of flowers, Rhodes said, donations may be made to the Eliza Keverian Charitable Foundation, a fund that serves the needy and was established in memory of Mr. Keverian's mother. Donations may be sent to the fund care of Bank of America, 100 Federal St., Boston, 02110.
