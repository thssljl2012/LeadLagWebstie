The packs include cupboard safety catches and socket plugs, along with information on keeping children safe at home.  These will be distributed by the Plunket nurse at the nine-month or 15-month 'Well Child' checks.  Thanks to Trust Aoraki, Temuka Plunket has also been able to stock up on smoke alarms, which are distributed to every Temuka family with a new baby.  On March 16, Temuka Plunket will host ANZ bank and the Inland Revenue Department to give presentations on family support, tax credits, donation rebates and budgeting. This is an informal night where parents can find out if they are receiving all the family support and tax credits they are entitled to and hear how best to take care of their money.  It will be held from 7.45pm in the Presbyterian Church Hall on Hally Tce. RSVP to Sandra on 615 9410 or text Michelle on 021 360 515.
