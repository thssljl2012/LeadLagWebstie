One lawmaker told Here Is The City: 'We are actively looking at ways to ensure that the US taxpayer feels better about the bail-out of these large financial institutions. One way is to give members of the public access to the (often) subsidized food provided at these canteens. We acknowledge that there are security implications to be considered, but we are confident that we can overcome these issues. Giving the public access to staff toilets and restrooms at these firms is also under active consideration. We aim to move forward aggressively on this'.  And the saga of NapkinGate over at Merrill Lynch continues. The firm has now unequivocally denied that napkins are being rationed to one per employee over at the Merrill Lynch Grand Central London-based staff restaurant, or that employees are being charged extra to sit down and eat.   We have been able to establish, however, that staff who want an additional disposable cereal bowl will need to pay an extra nominal charge for the privilege. This is apparently to avoid unnecessary wastage and to help on the environmental front. We are also able to confirm that the recent increase in the price of a cup of tea from 35p to 50p was not imposed, as first thought, to get in some extra coppers to help pay down Bank of America's TARP funding (in fact, the 43% increase was down to the company that actually runs the canteen, and was the first increase in the price of a cup of tea for some 7 years).  In the meantime, readers have advised that Deutsche Bank has been charging for additional plastic utensils for a while now, and that Citi has got in on the one-person-per-napkin act.  Finally, an interesting post from one of our readers:  'I've hardly slept for the last couple of weeks, worrying that details of my last bonus payout will be made public.  I am one of around 700 Merrill Lynch bankers who bagged a bonus of over $1m last year (yes, one of the guys New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo wants to name and shame by publicly disclosing details of our bonuses).  The thought of this is making me ill. It's distracting me from my work, and making life difficult for me at home. My wife keeps telling me that I'm impossible to live with, and the kids quickly disappear to their rooms the minute I get back from the office. The fact is, I won't be able to stand the shame. Everyone will be pointing fingers at me. Overnight, I will become a pariah. And all because folks will finally learn that my bonus number isn't actually as big as I always make out. It's all so unfair!'.  Please use the 'E-Mail' button immediately under the article title to send this item to a friend.
