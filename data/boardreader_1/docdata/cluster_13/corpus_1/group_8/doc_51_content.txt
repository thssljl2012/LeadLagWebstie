ATHENS, Greece   A bomb exploded outside of a Citibank branch in Athens early Monday, causing some damage to the building but no injuries.  The bomb went off behind the building at 3 a.m. Monday (0100 GMT, 9 p.m. EDT Sunday) in the Nea Ionia district of the Greek capital, according to police statement.  There was no claim of responsibility for the attack.  The target pointed to Greek far-left militant groups, which have become increasingly aggressive following the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy in December - an incident that sparked the country's worst riots in decades.  Outside Citibank offices in Athens last month, police destroyed a car bomb that contained enough explosives to crumble a four-story building. There has been no claim of responsibility.
