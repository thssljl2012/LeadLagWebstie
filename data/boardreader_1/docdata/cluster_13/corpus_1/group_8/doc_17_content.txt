CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Delaney Law announced today that La Guadalupana's new Motion for an Emergency Temporary Restraining Order against Bank of America is set for hearing at 1:30 PM at the Daley Center. The fight is now back in court, instead of Washington D.C. where the Castro Family had been invited to testify with support from their Congressional Representation.   Third generation General Manager of La Guadalupana, Alejandro Castro was asked by a Chicago television reporter on Wednesday why Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) had invited troubled Chicago restaurant Mr. Beef to testify at stimulus hearings, but not the Midwest's number one maker and distributor of the Hispanic food staple - Masa; cornmeal, the main ingredient in tamales.   Mr. Castro explained that his Family was originally invited to testify at Wednesday's Congressional Hearings, but last week, were suddenly uninvited. According to Mr. Castro, he learned through local contacts and D.C. sources that Bank of America had reached out to multiple organizations and Representatives in order to derail La Guadalupana's invitation. 'Bank of America probably thinks we will turn our fight against our Congressman or even against Mr. Beef,' says Castro. 'We won't. Our beef is with the bank. We are happy someone is testifying about the banks and their abusive behavior in these difficult economic times and look forward to working with Representative Gutierrez and his staff.' 'This whole case is about the Bank publicly stating one thing while doing another,' says attorney William Delaney, 'We had hoped to stay out of court, but the Bank refused to stop communicating with La Guadalupana business relations and customers. This ongoing interference is crippling La Guadalupana and the Castro family in their struggle to survive.' The Castro family is not without powerful support. Last month, the League of United Latin American Citizens' (LULAC) National Board of Director's voted unanimously on a resolution in support of La Guadalupana and the Castro Family.
