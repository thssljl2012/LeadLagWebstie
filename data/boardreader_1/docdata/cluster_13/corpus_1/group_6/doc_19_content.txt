When bank robberies hit, they are looking for an easy and fast way out, authorities say.  The Orange County Register  When it comes to bank robberies, making a quick getaway on a busy  but not too busy  street is apparently one of the main concerns for culprits, authorities said.  According to statistics from the FBI, most bank robberies occur in busy commercial districts, where they can mesh with the public and have access to major streets. Bank branches that are located near freeways are also more likely to be hit.  They want an easy escape route, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  That might explain why some branches are hit multiple times, while some areas of the county, like Laguna Beach, are seldom hit.  With only three ways in and out of Laguna Beach, the city faced one bank robbery in 2008. However, a Washington Mutual branch at 11922 Brookhurst in Garden Grove, located less than two miles from the 22 freeway, was robbed four times that year. Next door, a Union Bank of California branch was robbed twice.  In 2007, most bank robberies in the United States occurred between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.  after most of the morning commute is finished but before evening traffic picks up.  They'll also likely hit in areas they are familiar with and close to home, Amormino said.  Bank robbers are also creatures of habit and if they rob more than one bank, there's a good chance they'll return to the area.  One man dubbed the boomerang bandit robbed a Bank of America branch at 26002 Marguerite Parkway in Mission Viejo on April 7, 2008. The next day, he robbed it again.
