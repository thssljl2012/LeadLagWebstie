Contributor: Emily Longwell-Grice  Email: news@cbs21.com    Email Story  Thousands of Pennsylvania homeowners stand to benefit from a $150 million settlement between the state and Countrywide Financial Corp.  Announcing the settlement Wednesday, State Attorney General Tom Corbett said 10,000 subprime and pay-option borrowers may be able to avoid foreclosure through the various forms of relief available as part of the deal.  Corbett's office alleged that Countrywide misled many Pennsylvanians, and encouraged them to take out loans they didn't understand and couldn't afford.  The practices employed by Countrywide are at the center of the nation's home-lending crisis.  The company was taken over by Bank of America last year.
