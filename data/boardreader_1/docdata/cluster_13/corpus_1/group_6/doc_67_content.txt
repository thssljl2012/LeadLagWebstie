A former Bank of America Corp. employee has been arrested and charged in connection with a multimillion-dollar scheme to misappropriate funds from customer accounts, according to the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida.  Ricardo Figuerado surrendered to authorities Thursday morning.  Figuerado allegedly misappropriated more than $11 million in customer funds for personal investments in Guatemala, Spain and elsewhere, and more than $1 million in customer funds to support his lavish lifestyle, according to a news release.  Prosecutors contend the fraud was conducted between the mid-1990s and May 2008.  During the course of the scheme, the defendants responsibilities at the various banks included providing services to customers who were liiving abroad but had accounts in South Florida, according to prosecutors.   Prosecutors allege that Figuerado convinced those customers to conduct their banking business through him, and that he discouraged them from obtaining records that would allow them to monitor their account activity.  In some cases, he told customers that it was not safe for them to have account statements mailed to their home countries and that online banking was not secure, officials say.  If convicted, Figuerado faces up to 30 years in prison.  BofA (NYSE: BAC) is based in Charlotte. It is the No. 4 lender in the Triangle by market share.
