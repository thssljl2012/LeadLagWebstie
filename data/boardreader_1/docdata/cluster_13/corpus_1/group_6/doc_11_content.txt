  TRUMBULL -- A man accused of holding up a series of banks and hotels faces new charges of robbing two other local businesses here during the same spree, police said.   Christopher Walsh, 25, of White Street in Stratford, was charged Wednesday with first-degree robbery, third-degree robbery, fifth-degree robbery and sixth-degree larceny.  Walsh, who remains incarcerated in lieu of bond, is accused of robbing a customer at the Bank of America on White Plains Road and the Trumbull Marriott Hotel on Hawley Lane on Dec. 11.  Walsh was already awaiting trial for allegedly robbing the Homewood Suites in Stratford, a Bank of America office here and the Shelton TD Banknorth, also in December.  In the latest case, police said, Walsh confronted a customer inside the bank, pointing his hand -- covered by a white sock -- at the victim and demanding money. He fled with an undetermined amount of cash, police said.  A short time later, police said, officers were dispatched to investigate an alarm at the Trumbull Marriott after a man matching Walsh's description entered the lobby, approached a female employee and demanded money.  The employee, at first, thought the man was joking, but when he repeated his demand, the employee became afraid and gave him her cash drawer, police said. The man fled with $250.  Police said Walsh was later identified as the robber in both instances.
