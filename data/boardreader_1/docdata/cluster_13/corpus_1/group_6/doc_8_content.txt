A 31-year-old Chicago man who police believe is responsible for up to a dozen bank robberies has been arrested thanks to an alert bank employee.  The FBI said in a press release that Fidel Belmontes, of the 4400 block of South Union Avenue in Chicago, was arrested Saturday and charged today with the robbery of a North Community Bank branch at 3401 North Western Avenue last November.  In the release, the FBI said Belmontes is a serial robber who had been nicknamed the 'Archer Heights Bandit' and is believed to be responsible for up to 12 robberies of Chicago banks since last October.  According to the release, Belmontes was trying to open a bank account at the North Community Bank at 1600 West Chicago Avenue last Saturday when he was recognized by a bank employee as a man sought for an earlier bank robbery. Chicago police were alerted, but Belmontes left the bank before they arrived. They searched the area surrounding the bank before eventually arresting Belmontes in the 1900 block of Chicago Avenue.  In the release, the FBI said that they found a demand note on the floor near where Belmontes had been sitting at the bank earlier that morning.  The bank robbery for which Belmontes was charged was on Nov. 14, 2008. The release said he went into the bank and handed a teller a note announcing the robbery and threatening harm if his demands weren't met. He got $1,000 in cash, left the bank on foot and disappeared into a passing crowd.
