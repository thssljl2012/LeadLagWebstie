Bank of America Corp. has confirmed in a filing with North Carolina officials that it is laying off nearly 140 workers from a local unit.  The Charlotte Observer reports that the workers are in a financial-advising unit called Preferred Services, which is aimed at middle-class investors.  The bank said in a Monday letter to Mayor Pat McCrory, which it is required to file, that notifications began Friday and that layoffs will be completed by March 10.  The newspaper also reported that the bank is laying off about 85 workers at a Preferred Services site in Dallas.  Last month, Bank of America said it expects to cut 30,000 to 35,000 jobs over the next three years, as it faces a deteriorating economic environment and tries to absorb Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
