The historic Mountain View Inn &amp; Conference Center on Route 30 in Westmoreland County is preparing to close at the end of the week.  Financing problems and the recession, coming on top of the typically slow winter period for the hospitality industry, are responsible for the expected end of the 85-year-old Unity landmark, its third-generation owners said yesterday.  The reservations center for the 89-room inn, located midway between Latrobe and Greensburg, was accepting no requests for rooms beyond Saturday night. 'Significant extraordinary declines in business associated with the national and regional recession, coupled with the decision of First Commonwealth Bank not to advance additional credit, has left us with no feasible alternative but to cease all major operations,' innkeepers Vance and Vicki Booher said in a statement released yesterday afternoon.  Wedding parties and event planners who had reserved dates at Mountain View began scrambling in recent days to rearrange their affairs. 'The phone has been ringing off the hook booking business,' said Steve Mitchell, general manager of the nearby Four Points by Sheraton in Greensburg. 'We're receiving phone calls from brides and other clients that were tentatively booked there, or booked there, and that were informed they're closing.' The Boohers have operated the hotel since 1983, when Mr. Booher's father died. The business has been in his family since 1940, handling 100 weddings a year in the past and hosting numerous other banquets and special events.  The couple said discussions will continue with First Commonwealth Bank, but 'absent an emergency influx of credit, we expect a final decision on the timing and nature of the closing to be made by the end of the week.' Deposits provided by customers reserving the hotel for future events have been placed into an escrow account for safekeeping, they said.  Ellen Deslam, who operates a Greensburg marketing company, had scheduled an April 18 Women's Expo that she rebooked this week at the Four Points. Mountain View's staff reassured her she would receive her deposit back, but Ms. Deslam, who grew up like many area residents using a giant swimming pool at the inn, said she would be disappointed to lose a local landmark. 'It's really a sad day for our community,' Ms. Deslam said. 'It's a beautiful, beautiful inn. I don't know what went wrong.' The Mountain View Inn Web site made no mention of any changes yesterday, continuing to advertise 'unforgettable historic ambience, quietly elegant lodging, an invigorating fitness center workout, a swim in the outdoor pool, two bocce courts, veranda, a Wine Spectator Award wine list' and its 33rd Street restaurant.  The hotel overlooking picturesque Chestnut Ridge advertises visits it received from a wide range of notable officials, personalities and performers, such as Ronald Reagan, Tony Bennett, The Temptations and Jehan Al Sadat, a former first lady of Egypt.  Mountain View Inn had a staff of 150 when it was written about in 1999, and the Boohers, who were not available for additional comment, commended them in their statement. 'This seems a very sad and regrettable end to a long and honorable history of providing the finest hospitality possible to our guests,' the Boohers wrote.
