--- 2:30 p.m. From the Dane County Sheriff's Office:  Madison, WI. January 29, 2009 " One of the men responsible for a town of Verona home invasion has been identified thanks to a rare DNA match.  The state crime lab has confirmed the results of a DNA test, which links Jarrell A. Murray, age 23, to the home invasion case on Cross Country Road that occurred on March 9, 2008.   Murray is currently in the Dane County Jail awaiting federal charges for his involvement in a string of bank robberies, including the US Bank in the town of Blooming Grove.  The town of Verona home invasion received attention last year because a female resident and her children were napping in their home at the time of the incident. The woman awoke at approximately 2:00 pm, and found a man approaching her daughters bedroom door. Once the men realized there was someone home, they fled. Detectives with the Dane County Sheriffs Office submitted DNA evidence to the state crime lab, and while also investigating the string of bank robberies, the DNA match was made.  The home invasion case will remain open with the Dane County Sheriffs Office, as it is believed a second man was involved, and he has yet to be identified. If you have any information on this crime, call the Dane County tip line at (608) 284-6900.
