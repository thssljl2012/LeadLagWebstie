WESTERN Sydney newspaper The Western Weekender has fallen into receivership amid suggestions its owner, Greg Evans, has disappeared and used funds to prop up Sydney's only remaining National Basketball League team.  John Lord, a partner in accounting firm PKF's corporate recovery division, has been appointed joint receiver and manager of The Western Weekender newspaper, which Mr Evans had owned along with the Sydney Spirit NBL basketball team, based in western Sydney.   Mr Lord is seeking a buyer for the newspaper, which has a circulation of 55,000 in Penrith and adjoining areas.   Mr Lord said he had 'no idea' of the location of Mr Evans, whom he was trying to contact through his lawyer.   However, he said it was clear the funds had been used to prop up the Sydney Spirit when it was formerly known as the West Sydney Razorbacks.   These funds were also used to support the Penrith-based Kick FM radio station, which along with the Sydney Spirit had been owned by Mr Evans's Trimedia Group, according to Mr Lord. 'There is no evidence that there has been any money going to buy Porsches or boats, but revenues from the newspaper have been used to pay salaries for Kick FM radio and the NBL team formerly known as the West Sydney Razorbacks, now known as the Sydney Spirit,' he said. The Western Weekender was no longer paying the salaries of either the basketball team or Kick FM, Mr Lord said. 'Mr Evans appears to have been gone for some time prior to our appointment.' Mr Evans placed the Sydney Spirit in administration in November last year, throwing the NBL into disarray. Ownership of the Sydney Spirit was reported to have reverted to the NBL after Mr Evans ignored a default notice served on him.   Mr Evans was not directly involved in running the paper, Mr Lord said, and it would continue to trade as a going concern. It is understood the paper makes about $3 million a year.   Informed sources said the paper had returned to profitability now it was not paying the wages of two other companies.   Its main secured creditor, the National Australia Bank, is believed to be owed about $1.7 million.   Mr Lord said he had received several expressions of interest in response to an advertisement in The Australian on Tuesday.   The ad set a deadline of the end of this week for interested parties.   It is understood neither of the two major newspaper publishers, News Limited and Fairfax, has expressed interest.
