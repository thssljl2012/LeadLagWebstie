The Commonwealth Bank says it will install gas detection systems in all its ATMs to combat a spate of robberies where gas has been used to blow up the cash machines.  In a new robbery technique, thieves pump gas into the ATM's money slot, before detonating the machine from a distance.  More than two dozen ATM robberies have occurred in NSW, Queensland and Victoria in recent months, prompting a joint investigation into the crime spree.  The investigation came as a Sydney couple were arrested on the Gold Coast over an ATM robbery in Brisbane on Saturday.  To combat the explosive robberies, the Commonwealth Bank on Thursday said it would install gas detection systems in its ATMs, which would be linked to onsite and back-to-base alarms. 'Blowing up ATMs can destroy not only the ATM, but also result in extensive damage to a branch,' said Ross McEwan, Retail Banking Services Group Executive at CBA. 'In the lead up to Christmas and beyond, we want to be able to provide our customers with uninterrupted and convenient access to our banking services. 'Where possible we also want to prevent even greater impacts of blowing up ATMs, including the potential for unintended injury to the public, bank personnel and contractors.'
