FRANKLIN Authorities are investigating after two masked gunmen assaulted a customer at an Easton Avenue bank Saturday morning and held up the branch for an undisclosed amount of cash.  The two men entered the Bank of America, at the Worlds Fair Drive intersection, at about 9:30 a.m. and encountered the 29-year-old customer in the foyer area, Somerset County Prosecutor Wayne J. Forrest said. After a brief struggle, one of the robbers struck the customer in the head with his gun and ordered him into the bank.  The gunmen then successfully robbed the bank and fled in an unknown direction before Franklin police arrived, Forrest said.  There were 10 employees and two customers in the building at the time of the robbery, he said. The customer who struggled with the gunmen was not seriously injured and did not require medical attention.
