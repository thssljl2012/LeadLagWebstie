Donations continue to pour in for the two toddlers whose Christmas was marred by tragedy Monday when they watched as their father shot and killed their mother.  Strangers have responded generously with donations, including two new beds for 3-year-old Reggie Johnson and his 2-year-old sister, Ariel, and a set of living room furniture, said grandmother Shirley Richards. Two days after their mother was killed, thieves broke into the apartment where the children had lived with their mother and stole the Christmas tree and presents.  But the shocking heartlessness of the two crimes has triggered an outpouring of generosity from the community despite a tough economy, said Richards. 'People are struggling to have a good Christmas themselves, and they're giving to me and my grandchildren,' said Richards. 'There's a lot of wonderful people in Florida, all over Florida.' Those who wish to give may visit any local Bank of America and inquire about the Laronda Becker Family Fund or send donations directly to Richards at 5728 Upland Way, West Palm Beach, Fla., 33417 - the home of Richards' sister, where she and the children are now staying.  The Royal Palm Funeral Home is handling arrangements. A viewing will begin at 11 a.m. Saturday followed by a service at 1 p.m., said Richards.
