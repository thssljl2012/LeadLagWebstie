The all-male choir made up of prison inmates sing carols in the ANZ main branch  THE Australia and New Zealand Bank cheered up customers and brought Christmas closer to the heart with choirs and carol singing at its main branch in Suva.  From midday to 2pm, the other day and yesterday, several groups including a choir made up of prison inmates, entertained bank customers with beautiful renditions of Christmas carols as they waited in line to be served.  The bank's marketing manager, Inoke Bainimarama, said they were adding value to their service, especially during the busy period.  'We have had positive feedback from our customers and people who were just passing through the bank,' said Mr Bainimarama.  'We strive to be a very different bank in all aspects of our services offering our customers service with a real difference.  'The Christmas carols are also to spread the message of Christmas which is love and unity.'
