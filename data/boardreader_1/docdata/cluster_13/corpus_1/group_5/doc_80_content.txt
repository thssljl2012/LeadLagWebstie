As allegations of fraud swirl around bankrupt Brooke Corp., the FBI has launched an investigation of the once-booming Overland Park-based franchiser and financier of insurance agencies.  FBI agents recently carted away 'a substantial number of banker's boxes' worth of documents, according to Albert Riederer, the court-appointed special master charged with untangling Brooke's complicated finances.  Riederer, a former Jackson County, Mo., prosecuting attorney and appeals court judge, said that the bureau had made an informal request for documents generated before his appointment as special master. He said he and the lawyers and accountants helping him sort out the Brooke debacle were cooperating fully. 'I can tell you that they've asked for access to virtually all the records of the company,' Riederer said. Bridget Patton, a spokeswoman for the FBI, confirmed that the FBI had begun an investigation but said it was in a preliminary stage and declined to comment further.  The collapse of Brooke, a once high-flying insurance and finance enterprise, has caused economic ripples nationwide. The company's demise has left thousands of insurance agents in a lurch -- many have been forced to close their doors -- and dozens of lenders with soured Brooke loans or securities on their books.  Founded in Phillipsburg, Kan., in 1986 by Robert Orr, Brooke originally aimed to provide small-town banks with competitive insurance services to sell to their customers.  It expanded a decade later, setting up a lending arm to finance the sale of Brooke agency franchises to aspiring entrepreneurs. In 1998, it moved its headquarters to Overland Park. In 2003 it went public.  The FBI investigation comes amid a cascade of lawsuits by banks and other lenders against Brooke charging that the company and Orr fraudulently diverted funds for their own benefit.  The suit charged that Brooke, at Orr's direction, had misappropriated millions of dollars and then destroyed evidence to conceal its actions.  Orr, through his attorneys, Kansas City lawyers Brian Gaddy and Matt Geiger, has denied wrongdoing, saying that he personally pledged and lost millions of dollars -- and his ownership of Brooke -- trying to save the companies.
