Grant Responds to Growing Need of Nations Food Banks Underscored by Troubling Results of Recent Survey  Feeding America released a report yesterday that documented a stunning surge in the number of Americans seeking emergency food assistance for the first time in the past year. Demand at Feeding Americas food banks increased an average of 30 percent in a single year, with many food banks reporting even higher increases. Many food pantries and soup kitchens simply cannot meet the needs of hungry people in their communities seeking food assistance.   A large portion of the Bank of America Charitable Foundations grant will be distributed to food banks that provide food and groceries to hundreds of food pantries, soup kitchens, Kids Cafes, senior meal programs and other emergency feeding programs throughout the nation.   Feeding America president and CEO Vicki Escarra said, A new survey of low-income Americans shows that our hunger crisis has grown dramatically. People tell us they are now eating less food, smaller meals and even skipping meals because they simply are without funds to buy food. Bank of America has recognized the tremendous strain many Americans face as a result of the economic downturn. We are extraordinarily grateful for this generous donation from Bank of America.   Bank of America remains focused on providing relevant, meaningful support to help individuals and families navigate difficult times, said Andrew D. Plepler, Global Community Impact Executive and President of the Bank of America Charitable Foundation. Ensuring vulnerable populations have access to basic services is a critical component to revitalizing our nations economy. Our partnership with Feeding America will help support their efforts to provide food and groceries to the 36 million Americans who are having enormous difficulty making ends meet.   Bank of America is a longstanding supporter of food banks across the country, having donated more than $900,000 and provided nearly 4,000 employee volunteer hours this year alone in addition to this $1 million grant. Bank of America plans to expand its employee volunteer efforts supporting this cause and will announce specific plans to that end in early 2009.
