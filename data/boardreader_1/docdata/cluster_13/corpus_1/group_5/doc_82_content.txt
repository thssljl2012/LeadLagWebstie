One of Floridas largest wholesale beverage distributors obtained the second portion of a $37.4 million construction mortgage for building a 550,000-square-foot warehouse near Madison Avenue and Interstate 4 in east Tampa.  Premier Beverage Co. LLC, a subsidiary of New York-based Charmer Sunbelt Group, obtained the mortgage from TD Bank on Dec. 19, Hillsborough County records show. The company distributes beer, wine, liquor and nonalcoholic beverages.  In November 2007, Premier Beverage received a $20.5 million loan, paying $17.8 million for 249 acres. With the recent loan, the company received another $16.9 million. Citibank assigned the previous loan to TD Bank as part of the $37.4 million mortgage.  Two Tampa Bay area-based companies, RR Simmons Design &amp;amp; Construction LLC and Kearney Construction Co. LLC, issued notices of commencement of construction on Dec. 22 for the warehouse, records show.  When Premier Beverage announced in late 2007 its plans to build a Tampa warehouse and office, it said it would eventually expand the space to as much as 1.5 million square feet and employ more than 450 people.  About 140 people now work at Premier Beverages Riverview location. Premier Beverages Florida headquarters are in Miramar, where it occupies 439,143 square feet.
