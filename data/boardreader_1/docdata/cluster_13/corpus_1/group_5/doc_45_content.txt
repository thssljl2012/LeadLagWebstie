The Nukurua Mahoragany Trust Holdings with the assistance of ANZ will open a new sawmill early next year.  Chairman Ratu Netava Tagi says through the interim governments imitative they have managed to get mahogany plants that belong to them.  He says the timely financial assistance from the ANZ bank will help mahogany land owners in the district of Viria, Nausori, Viwa and Vatukarasa harvest and mill their own timber. ANZ has given $350,000 dollars for the project.  Tagi says the Holdings currently has a bowser at Nukurua and the loan from the ANZ bank will enable them to purchase new trucks, a caterpillar and the requirements for a saw mill.  He says in the past they normally take all their mahogany to Galoa in Nava.  The new saw mill will be at Vugalei.  Fiji Broadcasting Corporation LTD
