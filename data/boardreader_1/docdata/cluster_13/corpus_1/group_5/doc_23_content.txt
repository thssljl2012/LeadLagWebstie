The Ballast Point Group limited liability company redeveloping a South Westshore apartment complex is seeking bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Westshore Cove Acquisition Group LLCs petition was filed Monday in the Tampa bankruptcy court. The company listed assets and debts between $50 million and $100 million. It owns The Cove, a 52-building apartment complex at 4001 S. Westshore Blvd., Tampa. Its the second bankruptcy in three months connected to the Ballast Point Group, a residential development firm located at 11300 Fourth St., N., St. Petersburg. Four Ballast Point entities YS Holdings Inc., Arlington Ridge LLC, Blair Homecrafters of Leesburg LLC and Blair Communities Inc. are developing an upscale residential community with a golf course near Leesburg filed for Chapter 11 protection in October.  Those entities were forced into bankruptcy when Wachovia Bank declared two loans totaling $22.7 million were in default, court records state. Since then the court has consolidated the bankruptcies into one case.  Westshore Cove Acquisition Group paid $61 million in 2005 for The Cove. LaSalle Bank, now owned by Bank of America, is seeking to foreclose on that loan as trustee for the Lehman Brothers commercial mortgage-backed securities 2007-C3.  M. Steven Sembler, chief executive officer of Ballast Point Group, did not return a call prior to deadline.
