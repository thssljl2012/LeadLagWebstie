omb outside Citibank offices in suburban Athens on Wednesday after a guard called to report the vehicle packed with enough explosives to destroy a four-story building.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but authorities suspect the device was the work of the left-wing Revolutionary Struggle, a group that first appeared in 2003 and is best known for firing a rocket-propelled grenade into the U.S. Embassy in 2007. That attack caused no injuries.  Hours before the car bomb was found, gunmen opened fire and threw an explosive that failed to detonate in the parking lot of the private Alter television station.  Nobody was hurt, but the attack suggested that leftist militants may be expanding their targets. It appears (the militants) have no specific targets and they are slowly spreading their action against all those (involved) in economic and political life, former public order minister Michalis Chrisochoidis said after the TV station attack.  In past proclamations, Revolutionary Struggle has portrayed itself as a champion of the poor and oppressed, and espoused anti-capitalist, anti-American and anti-European Union views.  In its most recent statement, it called for a widespread armed uprising against the state and said it aimed to avenge the death of a teenager killed in December by a policeman. The boys death sparked Greeces worst riots in decades.
