A teenager plunged her unsuspecting father into an estimated 10,000 of debt by illegally using his credit cards. Leanne Gavaghan, now 19, intercepted cards sent to her father Lee and also fraudulently applied for a card in his name.  She used the cash to pay off her own debts, including a car loan, over a five-month period.  But, despite her deceit, Mr Gavaghan told Preston Crown Court he did not want her locked up and the pair are now rebuilding their relationship.  Mr Gavaghan said her actions were 'totally out of character'.He told the Evening Post: 'I can't turn my back on my own daughter. I still love her and blood is thicker than water.'Leanne moved in with her father in April 2007, but only began using his credit cards in January 2008.  Mr Gavaghan, a builder from Squires Wood in Fulwood, only realised something was wrong when banks began to press for repayments. He had previously only used the cards in case of emergencies.  As well as running up debts of 2,200 on his two existing cards with Citibank and Lloyds TSB, she also used his details to get credit from Barclaycard, spending another 6,000. The court heard the amount of money involved totalled 10,000.  Father-of-two Mr Gavaghan added: 'I had to have her arrested, which was extremely hard because she's my daughter. She got herself into a bit of debt. That's what started it for her. She was working in Preston at the time.'Some of it stems from when me and my ex-wife divorced. She felt she didn't have anyone to talk to. Rightly or wrongly I didn't realise how much the divorce had affected her. She had her own flat, but couldn't keep it up and came to live with me.'She has never done anything wrong before in her life.'Mr Gavaghan said her actions had left his credit rating in tatters, and he said he was being chased by the banks for money he did not owe. Lloyds and Citibank, however, cleared the debt once court action began.He added: 'I've had threatening letters, text messages and bailiffs turn up. Barclaycard said it was my fault because she knew all my personal details.'Since then the debt has been been written off by Barclaycard and Mr Gavaghan's credit score reduced to zero.  During the hearing, the court heard Leanne had written a letter saying: 'I am sorry for everything I have done. I am a terrible person and don't deserve to be your daughter.'Leanne was asked to leave her father's home and now lives in Adelphi Street, Lancaster, where she also has a full-time job.  She pleaded guilty to 25 charges and asked for 182 to be taken into consideration. All were deception or false representation frauds.  Defending, Kathryn Johnson said: 'Her remorse is real and genuine.'Judge Woolman said he had considered a short jail sentence but had decided against youth custody.  Judge Woolman passed a community order for 18 months with a supervision requirement.
