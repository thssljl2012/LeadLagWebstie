Clermont County workers on alert      Print   Type: A A   Click-2-Listen  BATAVIA - Clermont County employees have been warned to be careful opening mail after an envelope addressed to a local government office was found to contain a suspicious white powder.  Based on 'the report we got ... it was just a harmless white powder substance,' Sheriff A.J. 'Tim' Rodenberg said Wednesday.  However, he sent an e-mail alert Tuesday to all county employees and area police chiefs.  'The envelope contained no return address, note, or any other identifying information regarding why it was sent or by whom,' the sheriff wrote in the e-mail.  'Please advise those within your offices who handle incoming mail to carefully examine it to the extent possible for any suspicious indicators before opening it,' the sheriff wrote. 'If it is suspected that the mail may contain something of concern, do not open it.'  The substance was discovered in an envelope addressed to a Clermont County government office, which has some mail sorted at a U.S. Bank facility at 5065 Wooster Pike in the Linwood neighborhood of Cincinnati, FBI Agent Mike Brooks said.  The Cincinnati Fire Department's hazardous materials team responded and analyzed the powder, Brooks said.  'The preliminary tests on the powder, which was inside the letter, (showed) there was no dangerous material,' Brooks said. 'No one at the scene showed any sign of any reaction to any type of harmful substance.'  The letter has been sent to the Ohio Department of Health's Laboratory Response Network for further analysis, Brooks said.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Postal Service inspectors are investigating, Brooks said.  The incident appears to have been isolated, Brooks said, adding that anyone who receives a similar mailing should call local police.  Concerns were raised because of deadly anthrax being sent through the U.S. mail in powder form in the past, Rodenberg said.  In 2001, mail laced with the bacterium killed people in other parts of the nation.  There were several reports of suspicious white powder being found in Clermont County about that time, the sheriff said.  Those substances didn't prove to be harmful, but the incidents prompted the institution of protocols for the safe handling of county mail, Rodenberg said.
