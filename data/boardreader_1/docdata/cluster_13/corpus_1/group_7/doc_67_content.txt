Plans to launch a service tomorrow to wire money between China and Taiwan through post offices have been postponed to an unspecified date, Chunghwa Post Co. said yesterday.  According to Chunghwa Post Deputy General Manager Huang Shu-chien, China's postal service authorities have informed the company that it is difficult for the Chinese side to begin the two-way remittance service as scheduled, but they did not explain why.  Chunghwa Post speculated that because of the large number of post offices in China - more than 37,000 - the authorities have not yet been able to work out the operational costs for wire transfers.  The state-run Chunghwa Post announced last week that two-way remittance services across the Taiwan Strait will begin Feb. 18, after the two sides launched direct postal links last Dec. 15.  The links were based on an agreement signed last November by Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin.  However, while the postal links got off the ground on the scheduled date, the remittance service was delayed due to what the two sides said were challenging technical problems.  Chunghwa Post first opened a wire transfer service in 1991 for people wishing to remit money to China. Currently, there are 91 post offices around Taiwan that offer the service, with NT dollar transfers converted to Chinese yuan through U.S.-based Citibank before being wired to designated banks in China.  On average, NT$1.46 billion (US$42.9 million) is transferred to China from Taiwan through Chunghwa Post every year.  Once the direct remittance service is launched, the process is expected to be much faster, although Citibank will continue to facilitate the currency exchange.
