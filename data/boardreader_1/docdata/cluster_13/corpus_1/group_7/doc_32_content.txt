 Written by Josh Tyquiengco, Pacific News Center - Guam, Saipan, CNMI, Asia-Pacific  Guam  Guam- As lawmakers prepare to submit their committee reports to get their bills on the session agenda, one bill stands out among the rest. Bill 51, otherwise known as the Governor's landfill financing measure, must also make it to the session floor....or the Government of Guam may be paying one million dollars a week by March 1.  Senator Frank Aguon Jr. is confident Bill 51 will be included in the session agenda. The measure, authored by the Governor, proposes three options to finance the cost of the Dandan landfill. The bill already received a public heairng and Aguon's committee is in charge of submitting a report by Friday. So far, the senator says everything is on schedule and his colleagues are prepared to make several recommendations when the bill is heard.  One of those recommendations that Aguon mentions, is having the Legislature take a final look at the measure after the bond money is obtained. The senator also says the Legislature has to address concerns that Section 30 money is becoming a primary backer to revenue bonds, instead of a secondary backstop.  Overall, Aguon has already invited Bank of America advisers and the Federal Receiver to the legislature when session begins next week Monday. He says having these officials present will give lawmakers a better understanding of the financial cost of the new landfill.  Senator Aguon adds lawmakers will address the negative comments made about Dandan being the only landfill site. They plan on incorporating economic options into Bill 51 that can encourage the District Court to choose other sites that can be more affordable.
