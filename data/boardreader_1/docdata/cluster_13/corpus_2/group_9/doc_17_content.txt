         This is a remarkable piece of detective work. I wonder what the connection is.  There appears to be a definite change of strategy from investment advisor to lawyers.  Also a search on Garant Partners throws up any number of identical News Releases all announcing the recruitment of a top lawyer to the firm. I have contacted one of these news agencies and asked if they were aware that no company of this name is a tenant of Citibank Plaza in Hong Kong. The reply I received was that they had no knowledge of the authenticity of the company and would delete the announcement.  It would seem that anybody can get an announcement posted onto one of these news services as they apparently don't check them out.  Nervous111
