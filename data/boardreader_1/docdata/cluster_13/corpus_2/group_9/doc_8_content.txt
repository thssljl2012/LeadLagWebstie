 11 Times Square   600 FT / 183 M   40 FLOORS   T/O - Page 6 - SkyscraperPage Forum   I'll post this here also, since it's in the running.  But it would be a shame if Downtown lost another large tenant.       http://www.observer.com/2009/real-es...nancial-center         Huge, Credit-Worthy Tenant Deloitte Thickens the Plot at World Financial Center        By Dana Rubinstein   April 20, 2009           Quote:                          The plot has thickened at Brookfield Properties' World Financial Center, a mammoth office complex that's been the source of endless speculation since Bank of America bought its primary tenant, Merrill Lynch, during the bank consolidations of yesteryear.      Now, new complications!  Deloitte -- the enormous accounting firm with headquarters at Two World Financial Center--has issued a request for proposals to landlords across the city in search of between 600,000 and 800,000 square feet of office space , according to industry sources.      Deloitte's reps at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, John Cefaly and Dale Schlather, wouldn't comment for this story, but  insiders tell The Observer that the landlords of both 11 Times Square and the future 4 World Trade Center have received the request for proposal.
