 ELN Message Board Posts          Recs: 25              Re: Additional Investor Relations Comments on Tysabri Advertisement in MS Connection    SO let me see if I understand this:         tysabri is supposed to be patient driven...         advertising has to be shareholder driven....         what does management do?         Oh, it hires Citibank. Which investmnet bank was it that they hired at $6 million if I recall correctly to sell EDT???         Perhaps if management just asked for patient or shareholdrs to volunteer at the next analyst meeting and  to organize and  the next scientific presentation and to announce the results of Bap Phase III and to revise and run Bap phase III, ELN management could spend all of its time defending its record.  It should not be bogged down with details of running a business when it is so much better focused on defending its record of ?achievement?         IMO.         thread start
