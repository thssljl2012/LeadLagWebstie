We manage at HOA in Lewisville near 121 and 35.  Old Denton, or Denton tap?  wherever that new market street and bank of america are located.  We will go whenever maintenance is, but lewisville was mostly planned for irrigation repair.    who have you been using for irrigation repair?  I would love to earn your business on that.
