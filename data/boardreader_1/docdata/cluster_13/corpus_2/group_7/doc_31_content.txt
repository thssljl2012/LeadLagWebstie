           Quoting  WorldTraveler  ( Reply 150 ):  why is it contrary?  DL  isn't asking  NW  to allow  DL  to handle any  NW  flights at  DL  stations.        I'm not talking about cities where  DL  mainline has employees. What KingAir200 and I are referencing are the memos put out that claimed that any station with M/L employees for  NW  would take over the vendored ramp work for  DL . This simply isn't happening yet. On top of that,  NW  employees are actually *losing* work in places where  NW  metal is being swapped with  DL  metal        Quote:  There is a clear line between the 2 carriers and  DL  is respecting it until the representation issues are sorted out.       Actually, they're not. There's nothing in our CBA saying we can't take over from a vendor. In addition to that, there's a lot of places where they are checking in  NW  pax at the  DL  counters (violation of scope)...
