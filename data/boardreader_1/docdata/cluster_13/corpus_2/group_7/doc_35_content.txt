CBA Sect. 24.D.3.a      3.Training Due To Excess    Pilots involuntarily excessed from a crew status shall be scheduled for training in reverse seniority order. Application of this paragraph shall not trigger passover pay for the involuntarily excessed pilots.      There was a semblance of reverse-seniority downgrade training in the intitial Training Letters after the close of Posting 8-02 last summer.  Downgraded captains went to 11FA, 11FM, 30FM, 57FM, and 72FM. Each seat was assigned by reverse seniority but the overall seniority was ignored. For example, the ANC downgrade was one of the most senior and the first one to lose his seat. He should have retained his captain seat the longest. After the 777 bid, the whole process was abrogated. In a savvy move, 18 of the initial 38 bid to the right seat of the 777.  Their initial training dates were cancelled and they were assigned 777 training dates in seniority (not reverse) order with the most junior retaining his B727 captain seat until the summer of 2010. I was not one of the smart ones. I towed the union line and did not bid the 777. After some thought, I realized that bidding the 777 may actually help some junior seat-holders on the next excess bid. It could be a win-win scenario. It depends on which seats end up with an excess of 1 and which seats are fattened up.  Restated:  If you are involuntarily excessed on the next bid and you want to remain in your current seat for the longest possible time, look carefully at the training letters and ask about the future training tempo by seat. Your downgrade training will not be scheduled by overall reverse seniority. The union leadership is being evasive on this whole issue.  You can decide if the company is violating this section of the CBA. To me, it's a no-brainer.  Hope this helps.
