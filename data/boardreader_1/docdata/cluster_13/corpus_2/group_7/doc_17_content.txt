But if you take a ride through uptown you'll see some fairly large "under the radar" projects that are well under way. And I don't mean simply land cleared; I mean cranes and steel in the air, and very much under construction; such as...     440 South Church (office bldg):  440 South Church, an office development in Charlotte   Bank of America (office bldg and hotel):  1 Bank of America Center. Building. Green. Opportunities. Coming Soon...      And a project currently under construction that I am most excited about is Center City Green; its going to be a parking garage like 7th St. Station, but instead of resturants, the retail on the bottom level will be a "green market", kind of like a smaller version of the markets you find in Philly and Seattle...     Center City Green:  center city green                       That's what's up CB. I hate to see 210 Trade not go up, I would like to see some taller high rises go up. But oh well.
