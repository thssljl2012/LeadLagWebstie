 3. Training Due To Excess    Pilots involuntarily excessed from a crew status shall be scheduled for training in reverse seniority order. Application of this paragraph shall not trigger passover pay for the involuntarily excessed pilots.      This is all the CBA says.  Seat specific is not in there.  The most senior trained 20+ months before the most junior is scheduled.  He is the only one trained so far.  No provision for intervening bids.  No passover pay.  Just info for future bidding.
