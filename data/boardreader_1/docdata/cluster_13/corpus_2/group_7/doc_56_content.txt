1. It is about serving US customers. It is not a call center to serve Telus customer in Canada. It is a call center to serve US customers of other US companies which are not Telus.    2. It is not a 1000 job loss in Canada. It is about 1000 job gain for Telus International in US and they probably 'stole' that from another US company.    3. If they don't do that in US, they probably cannot even get the business to start with. For example, (say) LA Hydro outsources their call center. Various call center companies bid for that. For political reason, if the call center is not in US soil, Telus International may not be allowed to bid at all.     4. Telus may not provide Canadian venture capital to set up such call center. Sure, Telus might provide initial investment to set up Telus International in 1996. Now, Telus International may just borrow money from US bank to finance that.    5. This has nothing to do with CRTC, Canadian TV service or Telus monopoly in its Canadian telephone market.
