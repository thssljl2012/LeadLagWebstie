What you are speaking about is a radical shift in the management paradigm. Some of our colleagues who came from PeoplExpress remember the Precepts, guiding values at the heart of that company's policies.  The Go Forward Plan is as dated as the adage "the customer is always right."   Can you imagine some other multi-national corporation like IBM or Citibank trying to succeed with a twelve-year old simplistic business plan?     The ability of our company to adapt to the ever-changing conditions in the aviation marketplace is what will determine if Continental will be a vibrant enterprise or just another competitor in the arena.     I used to read about quality circles from management theory books sometime ago.  Employees and managers from every section of the company would gather periodically to discuss all aspects of operations to ensure that the company was moving cohesively toward success.  Can you imagine sitting down with people from Sales, Marketing, P&amp;P, and Chelsea to exchange ideas or provide feedback on cabin service to a particular market?
