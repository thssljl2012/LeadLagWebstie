         Over the past few days I have had a most pleasant email exchange with a very helpful CSR at National Australia Bank named Niall Beirne. They are so appreciative of the concern from throughout the world. He reported that he printed out our email exchange and showed it to senior managment at NAB. He said "it brought a tear to many an eye."   We are sending a bank transfer to the Victoria Bushfire Appeal today. I believe most of this NAB info is included in the link, but this may be more complete.  Beneficiary:                Victorian Bushfire Appeal  Account Details                BSB: 082-001                          Account Number: 860 046 797  Beneficiary Bank:        National Australia Bank   SWIFT Address        NATAAU3303M
