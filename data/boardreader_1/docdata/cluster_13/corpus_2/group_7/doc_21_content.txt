kim must have something else up her sleeve. She's an attractive woman that will surely bed the right restaurant people to get a replacement. rumor has it that TGI Fridays even considered the spot. She sent around the following email to make sure no one blamed her:  Good Morning,   As you are all now are aware Harveys Bistro and Manuels on the 28th have decided to close their doors. They have been in the building for a very long time and we are sad to see them go.   The Leases for both restaurants expired on December 31, 2008 and the owners of the restaurants opted not to renew. With the situation of the ongoing decline in the economy and the City of Orlando moving of the Arena to the other side of town, they just could not find a way to keep the restaurants open for business in this economy.   We would also like everyone to be aware that neither I nor Bank of America has nothing to do with the ownership of the Building. Bank of America is a tenant like everyone else. Since the Building carries the name Bank of America and both restaurants were known as Tenants of the Building Bank of America Center reporters are using the name Bank of America but left off the word Center. We need for everyone to understand that the Bank has absolutely nothing to do with the ownership of the property.      If you have further question that I can answer I will if I can. Keep in mind that can not discuss confidential information about my Tenants.
