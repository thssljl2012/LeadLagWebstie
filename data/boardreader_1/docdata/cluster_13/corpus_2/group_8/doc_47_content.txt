Just call me the vulture...or at least devil's advocate. Maybe this is what Frank was referring to?           Andrew Main   March 05, 2009   Article from: The Australian   THE Surfers Paradise mega-mansion that is the home of newly bankrupt solicitor, entrepreneur and former Billabong boss Matthew Perrin could now be on the chopping block.     Perrin's trustee-in-bankruptcy, Graham Starkey, said on Tuesday that the $10 million-plus house was not involved in Mr Perrin's personal bankruptcy because it was not held in Mr Perrin's name, indicating it was in the name of his wife, Nicole.     However, the administrator and liquidator of two Perrin family companies, Julie Williams, will have no such limitations in selling the Cronin Island mansion to repay creditors because Ms Perrin went guarantor on a loan to her husband.     Ms Perrin, 34, reportedly resigned from family company Christie Qld Pty Ltd late last month, but is expected to be heavily involved in her husband's bankruptcy.     Christie, a $2 company, is understood to be the main Perrin family vehicle, despite only ever having had the couple as directors and shareholders. It is now in administration.     The other company, MDP Consolidated Pty Ltd, which takes its name from Matthew David Perrin, includes two of the couple's three children as shareholders and is in voluntary liquidation.     Ms Perrin is understood to have been a guarantor of at least one major personal loan to her husband, in collaboration with the two family companies, which are understood to include a $13million loan by the Commonwealth Bank.     Ms Williams, who is administrator of one Perrin family company and liquidator of another, said yesterday that it was "too early in the administration of both companies to give any detailed summaries of the financial position". But she said "there are substantial sums owed to a number of financiers".     Ms Williams, of Brisbane group Insolvency&amp;Turnaround Solutions, said creditors of the companies would be invited to attend meetings on March 12.     Matthew Perrin became a major figure in Queensland after buying into one of the founders' stakes in Billabong Surfwear and successfully floating it, with help from former Qantas chairman Gary Pemberton, in 2002.     Mr Perrin caused a major upset in the same year by selling 8million shares from his stake for a handsome profit shortly after he had fronted a roadshow as chief executive, extolling the company. He left the CEO role shortly afterwards, but has been active in Queensland horseracing and investment circles.     Mr Perrin filed for personal bankruptcy on Tuesday with reported debts of about $28million, despite his having been on the BRW Rich List last year with a fortune of $150 million shared with his wife.     His lawyers, Minter Ellison, said he had had problems with property in the Xian and Hunan provinces in China, where he had invested in shopping malls.     It emerged yesterday that Mr Perrin had as many as 60 racehorses at any one time. One of them named Come Undone.     Ownership of the racehorses, which were jointly owned by Matthew Perrin and his lawyer brother Scott, were reported to have been transferred to Scott's company Perrin Legal, or to a Rachel Perrin, over "a number of months", as one racing source put it.     Scott Perrin could not be contacted yesterday.     One of the horses, Largo Lad, is to run in the $1 million Newmarket Handicap at Flemington on Saturday.
