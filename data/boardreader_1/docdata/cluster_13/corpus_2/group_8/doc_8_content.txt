           You can still donate money/food or give blood without seeing the footy match.     What's more important - helping people or watching the game. If you don't know by now that there has been the horrific tragedy (that's still ongoing), you never will.     There are plenty of ways to donate - I've copied this from the Herald-Sun website;      Anyone wanting to volunteer to help in the bushfire relief effort can contact 1300 366 356.       If you want to donate money to the     Red Cross State Government Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund    , click on the link for details.        Or Phone 1800 811 700         Or go to any NAB, ANZ, Westpac or Commonwealth Bank branch           The NAB has set up an account for people to donate directly to    , click for details         Or go to any Bunnings store         Australia Post will donate $1 million to the bushfire relief fund and collect donations in more than 4000 post offices across the country.         Another appeal set up is the Myer Bushfire Appeal. All proceeds will go to the Salvation Army.  Donate at any Victorian Myer store .      It looks the Red Cross site is currently down, probably due to so many people wanting to donate.     Good on Essendon and the Western Bulldogs and the AFL for doing this.
