I suggest you get out an travel to some of those metro areas and their central cities that rank between 17th and 30th in population size. Overall, Minneapolis and its metro has much more to offer than most areas listed below it.

Even if they combine together, they still can't make it to the 20th I think. The fact that they are separated makes obtaining funding for grand high-density developments even more difficult, and thus the two cities play a relatively less important role in attracting the market around the metro to the cities than core cities of other metro areas.                      That's not necessarily true because if there is demand, developments will be built.  It has to do more with the mindset people have here.  The Twin Cities could sprawl to Duluth, Eau Claire, Rochester, and St. Cloud because people are willing to commute and want the large home with a big back yard.

Very few central cities have shopping malls and in case you haven't noticed, there are plenty of shopping malls in our inner-ring suburbs. Let the suburbs have them and their huge parking lots.

This is how it is throughout the country. Companies, large and small, build in the burbs because it's cheap and there is plenty of land to build and expand upon. Central cities attract financial firms (i.e. US Bank, Ameriprise, Thrivent Financial, Well Fargo, etc...), law firms, accounting firms, marketing firms, public relations, etc...
