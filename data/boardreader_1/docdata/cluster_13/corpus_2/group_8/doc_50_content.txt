                      Quote:              MANSFIELD  Teddy Vail says its worth the expense to hire an attorney to file a consumer lawsuit over the $6 datebook Sears sent his mother.        Since 2003, a series of collection agencies has contacted Margaret Vail, sometimes with more than one call a day, to pay for a mail order item she never ordered from the retailer, he said.        A lawsuit over $6 is frivolous. But a lawsuit over five years of harassment is not, the Hanley Road resident said.        Its not just one aggravating collection agency. It has become a collection agency hell. We feel its more like a case of extortion, than a case of bad debt. Finally we just got fed up and decided to do something, Teddy Vail said.        The civil case was filed in Richland County Common Pleas Court last month.    Margaret Vail named Citibank USA (purchaser of Sears Master Card) as a defendant, along with LVNV Funding LLC, RPM, University Fidelity Corp. Credit Indicator, Allied Interstate Inc., Sherman Acquisition, Zenta, Globa Vantedge Inc. and Northland Group.        Theyre bothering an 80-year-old woman, attorney Deborah L. Mack said. For years and years, this has been going on.        Sears Holding Corp. spokeswoman Kim Freely said last month she could not comment on a pending lawsuit.             The Rest Of The Story         Of course this isn't Sears harassing the lady directly.  That account has probably been bought and sold a dozen times since 2003.  But I sure hope that $6 is going to be worth the publicity they're getting over it.
