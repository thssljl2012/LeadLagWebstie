  Report outlines flaws in PA Turnpike lease plan        Quote:                  A public policy group says states should not rush into leasing existing road assets to the private sector.  In a report released Tuesday, March 24, the Philadelphia-based Pew Center on the States urged states considering public-private partnerships for infrastructure to exercise caution and lay down some ground rules to protect taxpayers and highway users.  The report centered on the proposed lease of the Pennsylvania Turnpike by state officials from May through September 2008. Legislation that would have enabled the $12.8 billion lease to divisions of Citibank and Spanish investor Abertis failed to advance from a state House committee.  Pew Center researchers reported what they believed the flaws in the proposal to be, including a lack of forethought by state officials into how a long-term lease would affect future generations.   http://www.landlinemag.com/todays_ne.../032509-03.htm
