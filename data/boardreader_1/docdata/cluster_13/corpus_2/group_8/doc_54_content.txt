I have no trouble believing that the exposure from this attraction generates them $10 million or more a year in revenue. It might be a smart business decision to keep going with it, especially with some of the new "green" exhibits they have and such. I think it really raises people's awareness of the brand, the vehicles, and where GM is going.       Everyone needs to remember not to go overboard with this whole "every nickel corporate America spends that doesn't go into a worker's pocket is a waste" mentality. There are legitimate reasons to enter in to sponsorship arrangements.                      Citigroup is still giving $20 million for the naming rights of Shea...even with the government bailout!!     I'm a GM girl.  Every vehicle I have owned has been a General Motors car.     GM is staying in Nascar, and hopefully they will be able to continue their sponsorship of Test Track.   Julie
