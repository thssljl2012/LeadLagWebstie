        QUOTE (Piedmont1984 &#064; Mar 4 2009, 05:08 PM)       Put another way, the process is complete only when a contract has been inked, ratified and implemented with the Nic award intact.    The  transition  process is complete when the single contract is ratified.  There were three separate and independent steps that had to be accomplished before integrated operations could be conducted.    1 - Single ops certificate 2 - Single seniority list 3 - Single contract  It mattered not which was completed first or the order of completion, as long as all were completed.  It could have been seniority first, ops cert second, contract third, or any other order.  As of today, two of the three steps have been completed - SOC and seniority list.  The question before the court is whether or not the majority can circumvent the completed seniority integration by changing CBA's without that CBA being in violation of it's DFR responsibilities.
