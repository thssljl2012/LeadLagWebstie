  Ed, I did attend the agricultural symposium at the civic center a couple of weeks ago, and one thing that was noted was that this AFFA group has a goal of being a private association, not county owned, and that it would eventually when financially able have its own director.  That position would not be tax funded either.    I hope this could work but kind of am leery of the group being able to afford a full time person for quite a while.
