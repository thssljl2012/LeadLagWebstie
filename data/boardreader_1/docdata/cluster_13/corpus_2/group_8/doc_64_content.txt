Fugh, In you're in high gear this morning, must have had a good nights sleep. There are two sides to every equation. If Americans would have sent $250 bil more to the government last year what would have been the negative effect on the economy? Your senerio is akin the the president of Coke saying "If we stop all advertising we'll make Billions" Secondly regarding jobs, and I've talked about this verbatim, during the Bush years tell me how many jobs GM, Ford, HP, Pfizer, Dell, Cisco, Intel, Citibank etc moved offshore? Who provided the roadmap for this transfer of our workforce. End of story.
