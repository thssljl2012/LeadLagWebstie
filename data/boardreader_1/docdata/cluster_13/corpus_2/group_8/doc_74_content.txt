  "Very few central cities have shopping malls and in case you haven't noticed, there are plenty of shopping malls in our inner-ring suburbs. Let the suburbs have them and their huge parking lots."     Shopping malls can be urban. Building the malls inside city limits would make them urban looking. Why would I think a lot of parking lots would make Twin Cities more like it is the 16th largest metro area? The problem with Twin Cities is they are not dense enough, not that they are too dense. If Nicollet Mall has 100 stores, then it can be considered a shopping mall, whether it has a roof or not. Currently it has 10 or 20.      Good examples include downtowns of Portland, San Francisco, Boston, San Diego, Beverley Hills area of LA, etc. People would think a city like Atlanta is very sprawled. However, the Buckhead area, around the city's premier shopping center, is actually pretty dense and almost became the city's second skyline, and currently Buckhead is still within Atlanta's city limits. If downtown of Minneapolis doesn't work, something like a second skyline would also boost up its big city feel to some extent.      This is just for the sake of discussion of the city feel though. With the current situation, of course it is silly to build or expand any shopping mall.

Overall, Minneapolis and its metro has much more to offer than most   areas listed below it.           That's not necessarily true because if there is demand, developments will be built. It has to do more with the mindset people have here. The Twin Cities could sprawl to Duluth, Eau Claire, Rochester, and St. Cloud because people are willing to commute and want the large home with a big back yard.            Very few central cities have shopping malls and in case you haven't noticed, there are plenty of shopping malls in our inner-ring suburbs. Let the suburbs have them and their huge parking lots.           This is how it is throughout the country. Companies, large and small, build in the burbs because it's cheap and there is plenty of land to build and expand upon. Central cities attract financial firms (i.e. US Bank, Ameriprise, Thrivent Financial, Well Fargo, etc...), law firms, accounting firms, marketing firms, public relations, etc...
