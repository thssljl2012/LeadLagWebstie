                             Fulfilling US Muslims Home Dream      A US bank has been awarded for offering Shari`ah-compliant banking products to help American Muslims fulfill their cherished dream of owning a house.      "I never thought I'd be involved in Islamic banking because I'd never even heard of it," Stephen L. Ranzini, President of the Michigan-based University Islamic Financial Corporation, told The New York Times on Saturday, March 7.      "And it's been a stretch to learn it, succeed at it and make it work."      The bank has received the American Bankers Association's 2009 Community Bank Award largely for helping raise homeownership category among US Muslims.      "But you feel best about the things that were hardest to do," said Ranzini, 43.      Muslims are much less likely to be homeowners partially due to the fact that they do not benefit from the conventional bank's mortgage loans as Islam forbids followers from usury, receiving or paying interest on loans.      In December 2005, the University Bank launched an entire subsidiary to help Muslim customers through Shari`ah-compliant products to help them own houses.      So far, it has done nearly $80 million in "mortgage-alternative" financing for residential and commercial real estate in 15 states.      While many conventional banks went bankrupt over the worsening global financial crisis, the University Bank this week recorded one of its best periods ever.      It completed 11 home sales, more than twice the weekly average, to observant Muslim customers, and pushed four more closings into next week.      Shari`ah-compliant financing deals resemble lease-to-own arrangements, layaway plans, joint purchase and sale agreements, or partnerships.      Islamic banks and finance institutions cannot receive or provide funds for anything involving alcohol, gambling, pornography, tobacco, weapons or pork.       Trend       For many observers, the University Banks booming Shari`ah-compliant products are only part of a national trend.      "It's part of this religious revival, this return to roots, you see taking place not only in Islam but in many faiths," said Isam Salah, an expert in Islamic financing at the international law firm King &amp; Spalding.      "And as people began to see the feasibility of Islamic financing, you had smart bankers saying: 'There are seven million Muslims in the US Theres a niche market no one is serving, and I can do it.' "      Following the suit of the University Bank, Devon Bank in Chicago and Guidance Residential in Reston, Virginia, are also offering Islamically-accepted mortgage alternatives.         http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1235628921823&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout
