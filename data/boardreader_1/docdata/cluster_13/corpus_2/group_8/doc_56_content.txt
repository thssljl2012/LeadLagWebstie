I cannot understand how a company crying poverty, begging for government bailouts, saying they won't have enough cash to last another 3 months, and laying off workers can justify 10 million bucks to sponsor a theme park ride. Maybe Toyota can come in and take over sponsorship.                      $10 million a year, while it sounds like a lot, is really very little to a major corporation. I'm actually shocked that's all it costs them. Citibank was going to pay $400 million for 20 year naming rights on the new Mets stadium. That's $20 million a year for far less exposure.     I have no trouble believing that the exposure from this attraction generates them $10 million or more a year in revenue. It might be a smart business decision to keep going with it, especially with some of the new "green" exhibits they have and such. I think it really raises people's awareness of the brand, the vehicles, and where GM is going.     Everyone needs to remember not to go overboard with this whole "every nickel corporate America spends that doesn't go into a worker's pocket is a waste" mentality. There are legitimate reasons to enter in to sponsorship arrangements.
