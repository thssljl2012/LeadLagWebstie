 How do we report for a US citizen that is residing in Argentina and operating an internet business, all receipts are received through paypal into US bank account?  She operates worldwide.  She has not filed US taxes in YEARS!!!  Now wants to file on self employment to increase her Social Security Benefit.        Spouse who is operating the business is US Citizen, has a son as a dependent that is a US born citizen, husband is non US citizen, resident of Argentina who has Argentina earnings, however has a US social security number assigned back in 1980's for work only.  Husband works in Argentina and pays Argentina taxes.        I believe where I am confused is the husband who is not a US Citizen, but has a Social Security Number.      Do we file the spouse (US Citzen) who has the business as MFS and claim the son as dependent,  obviously don't want to exclude the foreign income as she wants the Social Security Credits and disregard the husband (non US Citizen) even though he has a social security number.  He does not appear to be claiming dual citizenship?      Any assistance?        Sandy
