 I typed 600! Today as a side job I type a list of foreclosure actions in Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx and Staten Island. I just counted 120 in Nassau alone. Very sad. And just because I know there a few here that have said I don't really do this. Here are a few I took the names out. The index # is the number the court gives you when the action is filed. It is offically called a Lis Penden or a notice of pendency. I hope no here ever gets served with one of these. It public information.     BANK OF AMERICA     16346 MATHIAS AVE JAMAICA, NY 11433     INDEX # 4917/09 B-10202 L-20
