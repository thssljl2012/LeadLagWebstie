  Lynchings still happen in the deep south on an almost daily basis? Segregation is still in place? Women still can't vote? Goodness.         Foreclosures.    Unemployment.    Homelessness.    $1000 an hour for each hour waited in an emergency room by a crooked hospital that I know about that never intends to admit a patient in house and waits until the patient or the family asks to have the patient discharged from the e.r. and a hospital administration that never intends to properly treat the patient instead making a quick $1000 an hour for doing NOTHING!!!  (Well, with the exception of a little abusive machine which I don't feel like describing right now.)      More and more people subjected to medications that they do not need that feed an ever growing pharmaceutical BUSINESS as opposed to proper medical treatment.    I do know of a good hospital by the way.   But I live in California and Arnold Schwarzenegger criminalized mental illness and it has become a big business money maker without proper treatment at all.  Criminals are more and more being called &amp;quot;mentally ill&amp;quot; not so that they are treated but so that their Miranda rights can be taken away from them.  Black people have higher numbers among the &amp;quot;mentally ill&amp;quot; than do white people.  There are more &amp;quot;mentally ill&amp;quot; black people in the state of California than white people.  Schools are insisting more and more on drugging children for behavior problems rather than suggesting that parents dedicate more time to consistent child rearing practices.    And there is subtle rebellion that is growing:  litter, vandalism, etc.      Are there wonderful things?  Most certainly. Definitely.  But neighborhoods have broken down.  Neighbors do not socialize as they used to.  There are pros and cons about neighbors socializing, but if people do not know their neighbors and talk on a regular basis then Neighborhood Watch programs fail and crime goes up.      There is an increase in the divide between the haves and the have nots.  Waiting lists for subsistence apartments are anywhere from three to ten years!    Yes - society has a LOT of problems.    Not to mention four major companies such as General Motors having massive lay-offs and also Bank of America recently lying off 20,000 employees.    Oh yeah.  And less than ten miles from my home on Christmas Eve a distraught ex-husband murdered nine people and injured two more at a Christmas party; the first being a little eight-year-old girl.            By the way, I'm a Christian.  A ROTTEN one.  I need all the love from decent people of all creeds; religious or not!!!!!      By the way, as unpopular as this sounds, homosexuality is a CHOICE.  As is sexual behavior.  If homosexuals are not careful, homosexuality will be put back into the DSMV as a mental illness as it was not that many years ago.      Ditto for &amp;quot;overly&amp;quot; religious people; appropriate levels of faith to be determined by the psychiatric community; etc.
