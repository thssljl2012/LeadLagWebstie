   Judged:     4     4     4       Has any ot the bloggers on this site noticed that if any one makes a derogatory remark about M Smith that the Judgements are always "spam nuts and clueless". Maybe it his site and his only to make comments!! Oh and apparently he has some hair brained scheme before council for an "airside park" for "Harrowvale", the only such park where you have to fly the planes over the road to get to the airport to take off and land. I do not think he has the money to divert the main road without his main benefactors V Ollis and G Shields whom I believe is 90% shareholder of the company that purchased "Harrowvale". Oh but don't they owe the Westpac Bank in the vicinity of $14m. according to the Supreme Court Reports.
