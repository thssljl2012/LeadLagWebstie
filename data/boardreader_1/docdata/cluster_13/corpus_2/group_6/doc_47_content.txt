My theory is that they still offer decent sale fares for routes with limited direct flights. I expect there are limited direct flights SYD to HBA hence the going via MEL is the same or marginally more. This is also the same for ADL- CBA, especially on weekends, with a SYD or MEL transit costing a margin amount more. Whereas a BNE to MEL, or ADL to SYD seem to cost vastly more if transiting via SYD or MEL respectively.
