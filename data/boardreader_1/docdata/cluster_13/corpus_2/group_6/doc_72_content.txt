  It should  definitely  have a public observation deck. The circular upper floors of US Bank could've been perfect for that, but alas.      I agree that LA's defining icon ought to be somewhere along Wilshire, too. Whenever I get to drive into LA, my favorite view of the city is from the 10, looking north towards the towers lining Wilshire, with the sea of homes and palm trees in between. I'm a big fan of that sort of linear development, with high density areas lining the arterial roads and freeways.      Eventually, I'd like to see high rises of all types and uses lining all the major roads, like that. Since the LA basin is almost totally built out, that sort of density shouldn't be too far away from happening, I think. (unless we build a 12-lane freeway tunnel straight through to Lancaster!)      This iconic building ought to help take LA's traditional strip development patterns to the next level of urbanism, by promoting increased density, transit, and walkability.      ...Just my delusions of grandeur...      ...and it should be at least 2000 ft. Can't let Dubai have  all  the fun!
