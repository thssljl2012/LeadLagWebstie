       Ex-bank manager in Miami Beach accused in $11 million fraud   http://www.miamiherald.com/business/story/867431.html   Posted on Friday, 01.23.09  BY MARTHA BRANNIGAN mbrannigan@MiamiHerald.com  Ricardo Figueredo, a former employee of Bank of America and Barnett Bank, was charged in federal court with bank fraud in a scheme to misappropriate $11 million from customer accounts between the mid-1990s and 2008.  According to the U.S. attorney's office in Miami, Figueredo, a former assistant branch manager with Bank of America at 401 Lincoln Rd., Miami Beach, was expected to surrender to authorities Thursday morning and was scheduled to make an initial appearance before a magistrate at 1:30 p.m.  According to a criminal information filed in U.S. District Court in Miami, Figueredo dealt with customers who lived outside the United States but kept accounts in South Florida. The prosecution alleges he misappropriated more than $11 million in customer funds for personal investments in Guatemala, Spain and elsewhere and used more than $1 million in customer funds ``to support his lavish lifestyle.''   The criminal information alleges he took money from certain customers' accounts to cover interest payments or withdrawals from other customers' accounts.  He offered personalized service and sometimes above-market interest rates and persuaded customers to deal with him instead of receiving bank statements or using online banking access to review their accounts, the court papers allege.  Figueredo initially worked at Barnett Bank and continued with the institution after it was acquired in 1998 by NationsBank, which later became Bank of America. He faces up to 30 years if convicted of the bank fraud.  Figueredo couldn't immediately be reached for comment. A Bank of America spokesman also couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
