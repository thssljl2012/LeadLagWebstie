 I know a successful Real Estate Entrepreneur that has a Coin Laundry Business as part of his business portfolio.  He's been running two of them in our small town for perhaps 10-15 years. One laundry facility is not-staffed at all and is open 24-7; the other is part of three businesses in one building: Insurance Offices, Tanning Booths (Staffed), and Coin Laundry; it is open from about 9am to 10pm daily.       His other businesses are:    1) Nationwide Insurance Agency Owner (2 staff sales people)   2) Real Estate Investing (Including Remodeling them; Residential &amp; Commercial)   3) Coin Laundry(s)   4) Tanning Salon(s)      He started out as a successful sales-person for IBM many years ago, and I would say that he's roughly my age, about 45 years old.  And perhaps one of the few (or only) very successful black business entrepreneurs that many people in our community consider very gracious, kind, happy, and busy.  Married with a wife, and 3 college aged kids.      I believe the main income streams that initially started him out were real estate (when it was appreciating very well), and also having a serious full-time job (sales career)  during  his start-up into becoming an entrepreneur.      Cheers.
