It will also be remembered that it was George Soros who, via his hedge funds, attacked Englands currency back in 1992, which led to losses of billions of pounds to the British taxpayer and the resignation of then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont. At the time, Lamont had run into a blizzard of flak from the Bank of England, who disagreed with his economic policies. Not least, Sterling was pegged to the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM)  a vehicle specifically designed to create the new European currency unit -- the Euro. The consequence of Soross &amp;quot;Black Wednesday&amp;quot; manoeuvres was to force Britain to leave the ERM.      Rothschilds, of course, sit at the heart of Englands financial establishment and, for generations, have boasted exceptionally close ties to the Bank of England. This is not to say that it was the &amp;quot;Old Lady&amp;quot; of Threadneedle Street who leaked the information about the planned intervention in support of the Euro to Rothschilds, who passed it along to Louis Bacon who dealt through Citibank. But, at least, we can show that these connections do exist and note an anti-European stance by the right wing ruling elite in the United Kingdom that borders on political fervour.      And it is the Rothschilds, Hambros and others who form an integral part of the Anglo-American &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; relationship that is historically deeply embedded in the Republican Party  to which Louis Bacon is a known large contributor.
