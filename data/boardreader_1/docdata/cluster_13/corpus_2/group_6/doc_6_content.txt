         Last week, a guy named Chris Brunner posted a pretty comprehensive list of banks that  may  be on shaky ground over at    LewRockwell.com    using the &amp;quot;Texas Ratio&amp;quot; which measures a banks credit troubles.  According to Mr. Brunner, banks with a TR over 100 are in &amp;quot;very serious danger of collapse&amp;quot; and those with a TR over 50 are &amp;quot;vulnerable.&amp;quot;    There are a few banks in the metro with a TR over 50.  They are:     American Sterling Bank  in Sugar Creek (92)   Northland National Bank  in Gladstone (72)   H&amp;amp;R Block Bank  in Kansas City (72)   Bank of Belton  (68)   First Bank of Kansas City  (67)   1st Financial Bank  in Overland Park (52)     **Disclaimer - Neither I, nor this forum, are implying these banks are on the verge of failure.  Rather, I am posting data gathered from other sources as a means of sharing information.**     In case your interested, some of the other larger metro banks have these TR's:     Bank of America  (10)   Commerce Bank  (2)   UMB  (2)       Karl Waldman    has put all these banks with a TR over 50 on a    map    if you need a visual.
