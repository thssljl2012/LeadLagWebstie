Did some digging to see what the official status was with the project and came across a couple pieces of info:      Bank of America filed a breach of contract case against Bannister Partners LLC and 3 Trails Acquisition II LLC back in November -- hearing is set for Feb. 6th.  For more info, go  here  and type in case # 0816-CV34771. Also, KC Business Journal article on the lawsuit  here .      On a more positive note, the City Council approved the preliminary plat for the redevelopment area last Thursday.  The ordinance is wordy but it outlines the work that must be done.  At least it's another step in the process complete, an encouraging sign of progress.  City clerk's site has  all the details .
