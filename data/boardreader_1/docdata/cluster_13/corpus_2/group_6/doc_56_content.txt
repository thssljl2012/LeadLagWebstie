     Quote:                          FAILED investment group Storm Financial allegedly pumped oxygen on 300 or more clients to raise levels of enthusiasm during extended seminars.      The Queensland company, which collapsed this month,  also purportedly used listening devices to monitor conversations in private rooms used for one-on-one consultations with prospective investors.    Perth-based financial planner Cameron Paul alleged yesterday that Storm executives, including founder Emmanuel Cassimatis, proudly revealed the bizarre inner workings of the company's Brisbane office about two years ago.    Mr Paul said he was shown the oxygen tanks used during the seminars and Mr Cassimatis personally told him about the use of bugs to listen in on clients.    Mr Paul, a director of  Momentum Planning , had been approached by Storm to form a joint venture partnership to give the then fast-growing Townsville-based company a foothold in Western Australia.    But Mr Paul said the two firms never merged because he found Storm's business practices and client ethics troubling, likening it to a cult.     "We were absolutely shocked," Mr Paul said.    Mr Cassimatis did not return calls yesterday.    Many of Storm's 14,000 clients face huge financial loses and even the loss of their homes after taking out high-risk margin loans to buy shares, which have now fallen in value.     A meeting of more than 200 Storm clients gathered last night at Margate, on the Redcliffe Peninsula, to consider joining a class action.    Storm appointed administrators this month after it collapsed owing $78 million.    The first meeting of creditors was also held yesterday.                      http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/s...22-952,00.html     And they're still drinking the cool aid.     After hearing News Radio this morn my sympathy began to subside somewhat. I heard many of them are now blaming the old arch criminal 'the bank' for allowing the loans. Which is swallowing the Storm company line, the kind of company which does the following, when possibly insolvent.          Quote:                         The administrators confirmed that the company founders, Townsville's Emmanuel and Julie Cassimatis, received a "dividend payment" of $2 million on December 15. That was just days before the company initiated legal action against Commonwealth Bank, and weeks before Storm was placed in administration.                      http://business.theage.com.au/busine...0120-7lnf.html
