  I am very averse to putting my information into any of the numerous "foreclosure" sites that come up on search engine. They do not inspire trust.       The only few homes I found were on Chase or citibank website - and those have maybe 6 properties in total for Brooklyn (all inundesirablelocations far from any train)and none for Manhattan. There is got to be more than that! Any advice?
