          The only strikes for bailouts are by employers. Basically the banks of the U.S. are on strike for that purpose. I.e. they are withholding their capital, what Marx referred to as dead labor. We&#039;ve seen more drastic examples in Chile, when the employers struck to get the army to bail them out of a welfare state, and in Venezuela, when businesses struck to get the U.S. to bail them out of the Chavez regime. The former worked, the latter didn&#039;t. The current U.S. bank strike is working so well it may become a model for future business schools. Blow up and bail out!
