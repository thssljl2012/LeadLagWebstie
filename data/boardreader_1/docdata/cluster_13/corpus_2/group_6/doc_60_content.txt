 ELN Message Board Posts     &amp;nbsp;    Recs: 52              Open Mike-Insert Foot   A few more episodes of 'As Elan Turns' and I'll need Thorazine. The past 100 hours have brought the following:    1. Last week, multiple rumors of buyout prospects, price runs up to 9's, a very large percentage move.    2. After close Friday, CEO Martin announces that no buyout is on the table, but in the same breath says ELN gets approached with regularity with offers.  Says debt will be bought down with sale of $500 mm of Phase 1 compounds, et al. initiatives. Debt market for ELN bonds rises in anticipation from lows @  50 cents on the dollar.    3. Bloomberg 'reports' extension of AAB-001 trials due to 'brain swelling' problems, and quotes new exec-VP voicing concerns of same. Yes, 'Brain-Swelling. He was actually referring to CEO Martin's swollen head, but Bloomberg reporter misquoted him.    4. ELN PR correcting Bloomberg article as 'erroneous'. 1st time in recorded ELN history that a correction of a news wire hit job was refuted within an hour of publication.    5. A hour later, Board of Directors announces all possibilities, including outright sale of ELN are being explored, Citibank, the known financial geniuses, whose shares have actually exceeded Elan's in price decline in 2008, have been retained by Elan BOD, with ELN management 'consultation', to explore options.    6. Irish analysts wake up to news, rejigger 'sum of the parts' evaluations for ELN at $13+ to $15+ USD.    7. Euro market shows ELN up strong, a full Euro, before NYSE Open. NYSE opens up a buck, fades in midmorning trade, closes down 2+% for the day, with new owners BIIB and WYE up btw 2.5% and 3.25% on the day's trade.    8. Prior to market close, K. Martin and entourage, who have jetted to Northern California for the Winter Wine and Gourmand Festival, visit a karioke bar at the hotel and sit too close to the open mike, proceed to babble amongst themselves regarding what they would really have said if those damn analysts and papparazi weren't always stalking them, hanging on every word only to misrepresent thier brilliant and crystalline management brainstorms.    9. Elan management/hedge fund operations celebrate in Wine Country on shareholder tab, having pulled a 'win' for Kinsale management and brethern on the Street in the face of untimely pre-LEAP opex share pumping. Shares decline from 9's on last week's rumors to mid 7's on Elan's appearance at conference. Martins mere appearance, in David Byrne-style 'Big Suit' in earth tones, in conference hotel lobby, dropped ELN share price and kept it down to secure key Opex profits.    10. Mary Stotts, new to the 'Days of Our Elan' soap, attempts to write PR's, first confering with CEO, then BOD, then CEO, again, gives up in frustration.  Adjourns to hotel bar, avoiding karioke section, and drinks heavily.    Next few weeks should bring even more dramatic episodes, so be sure to stay tuned.    vocex1
