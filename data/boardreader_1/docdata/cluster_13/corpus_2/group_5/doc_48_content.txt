 The plain truth is that, in all likelihood, the number of unsolved murders is more like 70 or 80%.  This 39% unsolved reflects only the deaths that are recognized as homicides.  Many murders are listed as suicides or accidents or simply missing persons, and are passed off with almost no critical investigation.  Of those, 100% are unsolved.       There was a story out of San Francisco a few years ago, that showed that in that city, in the previous year, less than 10% of all iknown homicides had been CBA (cleared by arrest).  If memory serves, the figure was more like 2 or 3%, but don&amp;#039;t hold me to that.
