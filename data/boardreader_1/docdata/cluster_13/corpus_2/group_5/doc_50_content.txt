   Judged:     4     2     1       The ruling should be in favor of the players. If the league does not have a ban on supplements altogether and they were informed about the dangers of a particular supplement and did not pass the information to their the players, they in turn risked the lives of each and every player by not providing notice, and more importantly should be in breach of the CBA because they did not act reasonably and in the interest and safety of the players. The NFLs instincts, if anything, were based on paranoia and not common sense and what is right. Particularly in the instance when they are aware that a supplement contains a banned substance, yet it does not provide for it on the bottle AND THEY KNEW IT - THAT IS NEGLIGENCE (no ifs ands or buts about it). The Collective Bargaining Agreement clauses that state that the players are responsible for what goes into their bodies should become obsolete because the NFL knowingly caused the damages of all of the players involved.
