    Section 1       SCOPE     Amend    Section 1 B. 28.    to:    Delete all references to Alaska and AS hub to hub baseline ratios.     Amend    Section 1 B. 40.    to read:     40. &amp;quot;Permitted aircraft type&amp;quot; means:     a. a propeller-driven aircraft configured with 70 or fewer passenger seats and with a maximum certificated gross takeoff weight in the United States of 70,000 or fewer pounds, and     b. a jet aircraft certificated for operation in the United States for 50 or fewer passenger seats and with a maximum certificated gross takeoff weight in the United States of 65,000 or fewer pounds, and       c. one of up to 255 jet aircraft configured with 51-70 passenger seats and certificated in the United States with a maximum gross takeoff weight of 86,000 pounds or less (&amp;quot;70-seat jets&amp;quot;), and         d. one of up to 120 jet aircraft configured with 71-76 passenger seats and certificated in the United States with a maximum gross takeoff weight of 86,000 pounds or less (&amp;quot;76-seat jets&amp;quot;).   The number of 76-seat jets may be increased above 120 by three 76-seat jets for each aircraft above the number of aircraft in the baseline fleet operated by the Company (in service, undergoing maintenance and operational spares) as of CBAID. The baseline fleet number will be 440+N, in which N is the number of aircraft (in service, undergoing maintenance and operational spares but not including permitted aircraft types) added to the Companys baseline fleet from NWA. The number and type of all aircraft in the Companys fleet on CBAID will be provided to the Association. The number of 70-seat jets plus 76-seat jets permitted by    Section 1 B. 40.    may not exceed 255.     Exception: Up to the 36 EMB-175s that were operated and/or ordered by Northwest prior to CBAID may continue to be operated with up to a maximum gross takeoff weight of 89,000 pounds.     e. once the number of permitted 76-seat jets is established, it will not be reduced. Exception one: If a pilot on the seniority list with an employment date prior to September 1, 2001 is placed on furlough, the Company will convert all 76-seat jets for operation as 70-seat jets.     Exception two: In the event the flow provisions of NWA LOA 2006-10 and LOA 2006-14 cease to be available, either at the feeder carrier affiliate referenced in such LOAs or at another carrier, the number of jet aircraft configured with 71-76 passenger seats specified in    Section 1 B. 40. d.    will revert to 85.     f. a carrier that operates any of the 70- or 76-seat jets not being operated as of November 1, 2004, may do so only if that carrier and the Company have agreed to terms for a preferential hiring process for pilots furloughed by the Company (i.e., a pilot furloughed by the Company will be given preferential hiring at a Delta Connection Carrier if he completes all new hire paper work, meets all new hire airman and medical qualifications, satisfies background checks and successfully completes an interview). The Company will offer preferential interviews for employment to airmen employed by a Delta Connection Carrier that offers preferential hiring to furloughed pilots under    Section 1 B. 40. e.   , subject to the Companys objectives for diversity and experience among newly hired pilots, and subject to the Companys hiring obligations under the NWA CBA LOAs as they appear in Attachment C (i.e. NWA LOA 2006-10, 2006-14, and 2008-01). A pilot hired by a Delta Connection Carrier operating any of the 70- or 76-seat jets not being operated as of November 1, 2004 will not be required to resign his Delta seniority number in order to be hired by such carrier. Preferential hiring rights at Delta Connection Carriers for pilots furloughed by the Company provided herein will be in addition to any flow down rights such furloughed pilots may have pursuant to the NWA CBA LOAs as they appear in Attachment C (i.e. NWA LOA 2006-10, 2006-14, and 2008-01).
