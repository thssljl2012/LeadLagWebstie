      I can&amp;#039;t say I have the research to back it up, but I think if there is a written CBA, and if the union people are not eligible to participate, the IRS is not going to challenge the assumption that it was the subject of &amp;amp;quot;good faith bargaining.&amp;amp;quot;  The CBAs specify the employee benefits for which the covered employees will be eligible.  It is a very rare labor negotiator (lawyer or otherwise) who has the foresight to make sure that there is an explicit recitation of those employer-sponsored plans for which the covered employees will NOT be eligible.
