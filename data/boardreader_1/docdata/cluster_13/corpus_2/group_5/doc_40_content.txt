Maybe you have not lived anywhere else and have nothing to compare it to but Charlotte is NOT a diverse economy even if you want to pretend it is.   You know those tall building in downtown, ur I mean &amp;quot;uptown&amp;quot;?      Well, what percentage of those over ten stories have bank names on them or relating to banking?      I would say over 50% Maybe up to 80%   Whats the name of the  NFL stadium there? Does it start with Bank Of... ..  come on..you know it..    What is Charlotte's 2nd largest job base outside of banking? City/state government?                         I'm pretty sure that would be either USAIR, Carolinas Healthcare Systems, Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools, IBM, Duke Energy, Lowes....just to name a few.        In addition, we have over 35,000 industrial firm type jobs (food manufacturing, tobacco and beverage firms, paper, printing, chemical companies etc...).  Charlotte's economic climate is more diverse than I think you realize.         Oh, and you keep making a big deal out of the fact that Panther Stadium is named Bank of America stadium - I guess you don't understand that that does not mean BofA has a thing to do with the actual running of or ownership of the stadium?? It just means they were willing to pay more money than any other corporation for the NAMING RIGHTS - big woop de do
