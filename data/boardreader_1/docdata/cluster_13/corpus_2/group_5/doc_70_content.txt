            Quote from: SpenceUK1968 on  Today  at 04:18:35 PM   What really gets to me is how bloody stupid the Israelis seem to be. (Not the average Joe on the street, as every society has it&amp;#039;s share of s*n readers.) It&amp;#039;s the supposedly clever ones in power that get to me, why the hell do they keep bombing out places in retaliation? Can they not see that all they are doing is adding fuel to this fire? Yes it hurts when your community is affected by terrorism, but there are much better ways to deal with it than blowing up streets in the hope you get the perpetrators. Why not just send a few Mossad types after the movers and shakers?  I&amp;#039;m sure that if they exercised a bit of restraint that things would get better. They could hardly get worse.  Then again I wonder if they are maybe egged on in their role of &amp;quot;Righteous vengance&amp;quot; by Uncle Sam in the hope of destabilising the Arab world further.  In the end, it&amp;#039;s ordinary folks who suffer from all of this, people just trying to feed their kids and get them an education, see them grow. Both sides need to take a step back, but until one side acts like they are bigger than their petty emotions, then it will never happen.  Anyway, back to work for me.  Peace and goodwill to all it said on some of the Xmas cards I got....Yeah right.   Because they can, that&amp;#039;s all!&amp;nbsp; As God&amp;#039;s chosen people, the US bank rolls them so they can continue to destabilise the Middle East.&amp;nbsp; Israel is practically bankrupt and always has been, and yet monetary issues never affect them. They can build several nuclear weapons, own the latest military planes.  After this raid on Palestine, nothing will happen to them, they&amp;#039;ll simply grow stronger.   I blame the &amp;#039;Arab Union&amp;#039; - whatever that is. If they can collectively think this through, they can sort this out without further bloodshed. The economic powers are probably swaying from the US right now, and the Arabs could have a significant influence.
