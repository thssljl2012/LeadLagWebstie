That place is so clean and advanced it's almost Canadian. :P                             Well, Charlotte has gone thru/ a lot of growth, and much of it has been too rapid.  I say that b/c our infrastructure has taken a hit.  Crowded schools, highway infrastructure that is behind, water/sewer . . . we have a lot of catching up to do.    However, w/ the economic downturn and w/ Charlotte being home to Wachovia and Bank of America . . . we are in for some serious economic challenges.  Our local newspaper reported last week that we lost about 31,000 jobs this year (2008).  And there are more lay-offs, due to bank mergers, on the horizon.      How this will affect our overall economy . . . hard to predict.  A slow down wh/ allows us to catch our breath may not be such a bad thing at this point in time.  However, more job loss will certainly mean people will be forced to re-locate in order to replace at least a good portion of those lost jobs.    Charlotte has all the right stuff to support businesses who might consider relocating to this region.  Temperate climate, wonderful burbs, outdoor activities . . . a really top notch place to raise a family.  My hope is that both new enterprises - and established corporations - will continue to see this region as a viable place to locate.  Retirees are also finding this area to be quite compatible.    Only time will tell how fragile - or stable - our economy proves to be  here in NC.
