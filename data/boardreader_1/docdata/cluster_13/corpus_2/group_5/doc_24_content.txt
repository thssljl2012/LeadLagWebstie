&amp;quot;llinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ordered the state government to suspend doing business with Bank of America on Monday as the weekend protest spilled into the workweek.&amp;quot;  Was this before or after his arrest?  You have to laugh at the moraility of someone like Blagojevich, ***** on Bank of America while at the same time trying to auction Obamas seat to the highest bidder.
