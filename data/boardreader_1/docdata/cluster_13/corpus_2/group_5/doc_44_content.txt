I would add today, after reading the NFL&amp;#039;s document, that it could boil down to jurisdiction.        The NFL managed to move the case from state to federal court.  And then they are contending the federal court has no right to interfere with NFL rulings in the CBA.        Jurisdiction is 9/10ths of the law.  A court can sympathize all they want with the players but not have the authority to rule on a case. _________________
