  The Yankee's also no longer have to share any revenue as the cost of the new stadium is deductible .    Its the American tax payer who should be the most upset as a lot of Yankee revenue comes from the very Wall street firms that caused this disaster in the 1st place.For example each entrance way and section have naming rights ie one entrance way is the Bank of America entrance the right to put that up costs 20 million per year x every entrance and section.All from businesses that would be bankrupt if not for taxpayer bailouts that they will spend the rest of their (our )our lives paying back.
