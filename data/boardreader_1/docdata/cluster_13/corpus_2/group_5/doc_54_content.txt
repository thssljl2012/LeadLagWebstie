A &amp;quot;fair wage&amp;quot; is not the &amp;quot;union wage.&amp;quot; A fair wage is whatever the market is charging. So if private snow clearing is, on average, $20/hour, that's what the city can contract out for.                           Look around terb, the link is here somewhere. This came up in another discussion and the link was posted and yes, as unbelieveable as it seems that IS correct....although it isn't as bad as the contract GM signed with the unions to pay people  not  to work......      Just trying to remember the topic, I think it was in regards to garbage collection and how mississauga contracted theirs out for a heck of a lot less than toronto is paying.       BTW: I didn't post the link, someone else did.....      This isn't the original link but it does show your fair wage policy:      &amp;quot;The Fair Wage Policy of the former City of Toronto has as its central tenet the prohibition of the City doing business with contractors and suppliers who discriminate against their workers. Originally implemented in 1893 to ensure that contractors for the City paid mechanics, workmen and labourers the union rates or, for non-union workers, the prevailing wages and benefits in their field, the Fair Wage Policy has expanded over the years to other classifications such as clerical workers. The policy also requires compliance with the acceptable number of working hours and conditions of work.&amp;quot;      The original link was in regards to the CBA and in that contract it specified that any non-union contractors hired had to be paid union rates. I'll see if I can dig that up....      I think this explains it:      &amp;quot;It is often assumed that binding obligations respecting labour trades (see Part 1) are, by definition, part of Fair Wage Policy. In fact, they are established by different authorities and set different wage compliance conditions for different purposes. While City Council does not control policy respecting labour trades, it needs to ensure that it is not subject to penalty for contravention of an agreement to which it is a party. As a result, confusion typically exists in understanding the differences between Labour Trade and Fair Wage requirements. In cases where municipalities have been determined to be employers in the construction industry, the wage rates for certified construction trades will override the Fair Wage Schedule rates for those classifications of work.  As a result, jurisdictions without binding agreements for labour trades tend to conclude that Fair Wage Policy automatically requires union rates of pay when this is not the case .&amp;quot;      So, one could assume that if no CBA was in place and the munincipalities have to pay union rates, the same would apply when there was a CBA in place dictating union rates. I mean, it is only logical.      Here's the link to the page that contains the above:       http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/1998/a...1rpt/cl007.htm
