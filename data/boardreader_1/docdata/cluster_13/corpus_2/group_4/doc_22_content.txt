 Hi,      there are many ways, how to hide CBA buttons. The favorite one is to define following resources:           Code:     RESOURCE EIK_APP_INFO  {   cba = r_empty_cba;  }       // ---------------------------------------------------------  //     //    Empty CBA buttons - only with the exit button  //    on the right   //  // ---------------------------------------------------------     RESOURCE CBA r_empty_cba  {   buttons =   {    CBA_BUTTON     {     id = EAknSoftkeyEmpty;    },    CBA_BUTTON     {     id = EEikCmdExit;     }   };  }    For fullscreen (if you want it) just call in the container the SetRect() - the size of rectangle depends if you want to hide also status pane or not.      Another method to hode control pane(with some drawbacks) is MEikAppUiFactory::Cba() - just check SDK and DiBo.      Blitting bitmap is easy - go over CFbsBitmap class and CWindowGc::BitBlt() - use this method in your Draw() implementetion in your container control.      BR   STeN
