hi, whoever can help me add an extra criteria to the above macro created by xld would be appreicated immensely. The above code works but i would like to add an extra criteria to the macro, i want the macro to look in Col F and if the description of both Ledger and Statement is the same then input the units next to each other in Col I and Col J under the releavnt headings else allocate separately under their headings as per the highlighted descriptions.                Description      Ledg Stmt          Units      Ledger      Statement        BHP      Ledg          389,351.00           389,351.00           599,811.00         BHP      Stmt          599,811.00             RIO      Ledg          148,822.00           148,822.00           209,536.00         RIO      Stmt          209,536.00             CBA      Ledg       1,674,562.00        1,674,562.00        1,661,564.00         CBA      Stmt       1,661,564.00             TLS      Stmt          111,110.00                        -             111,110.00         WOW      Stmt             7,738.00                        -                7,738.00         MGB      Ledg            39,164.00             39,164.00                        -           WPA      Ledg          197,088.00           197,088.00                        -           ANZ      Ledg          195,525.00           195,525.00                        -           MOT      Ledg             8,859.00              8,859.00              8,860.00         MOT      Stmt             8,860.00
