For about six decades, India hasdenied Kashmiris' their right of selfdetermination. India claims thatthe occupied Kashmir's constituent assembly has voted for accession toIndia. As such, it is no longer necessary for her to let the promisedplebiscite be held in Kashmir. Is India's argument tenable? Doeshistory or documents corroborate India's stand? Let us look moreclosely at India's stance. It is the Treaty of Amritsar (1846) whichentitled Gulab Singh to rule Jammu and Kashmir State. This treatystands lapsed under Article 7 of the Independence Act. The Act waspassed by British Parliament on July 18, 1947 to assent to creation ofindependent states of India and Pakistan. The aforementioned Article 7provides that, with lapse of His Majesty's suzerainty over Indianstates, all treaties, agreements, obligations, grants, usages andsufferance's will lapse.Mountbatten deliberately kept mum about this reality forconsiderations of political expediency. He was not 'politically naive,much less a fool' not to realise this truth. According to hisbiographer, Ziegler, Mountbatten had a 'powerful, analytic mind ofcrystalline clarity'. Yet, he had 'legendary capacity for self-deception'. He 'was a man who preferred falsehood to truth'. Even the'Instrument' of Accession is void for several reasons. TheIndependence Act required intention of accession to be absolute andcrystal-clear. But, a stray glance at the 'Instrument' would make itclear that it is equivocal. The 'Instrument' expresses 'intention toset up an interim government and to ask Sheikh Abdullah to carry theresponsibilities' with maharajah's prime minister. The last sentencein the 'Instrument' is 'In haste and with kind regards'. Handwrittencorrections on the text of the 'Instrument' speak volubly about thewavering state of the maharajah's mind. The instrument, extractedunder coercion and duress, is invalid under law.Subsequent accession resolution, passed by the occupied Kashmir's'constituent assembly' is also void. This resolution violates theSecurity Council's resolutions forbidding India from going ahead withthe accession farce. Aware of India's intention to get the 'Instrumentof Accession' rubber-stamped by the puppet assembly, the SecurityCouncil passed two resolutions to forestall the `foreseeableaccession' by the puppet assembly. Security Council's Resolution No 9of March 30, 1951 and affirmative Resolution No 122 of March 24, 1957outlaws accession or any other action to change status of the Jammuand Kashmir state. India gives the impression that the USA considersthe state's so called accession as legal. This is not true. OnOctober 28, 1993, Robin Raphel, in her statement, clarified thatWashington does not recognise the Instrument of Accession to India. Inits perception, Kashmir was a disputed territory, not an integral partof India. The future status of the state remained to be determined inaccordance with the wishes of the people of Kashmir.We hear echo of Raphel's statement in the resolution passed byInternational Commission of Jurists (ICJ), based in Geneva. TheCommission pointed out that the resolution, passed by occupied-Kashmirlegislature concerning Kashmir's accession to India was bogus and nulland void. Renowned journalist Alastair Lamb also regards theInstrument of Accession, 'signed' by the maharajah of Kashmir onOctober 26, 1947, as fraudulent (Kashmir - A disputed legacy1846-1990). She argues that the maharajah was travelling by road toJammu (a distance of over 350 km). How could he sign the instrumentwhile being on the run for safety of his life? There is no evidence ofany contact between him and the Indian emissaries on October 26,1947.Actually, it was on October 27, 1947 that the maharajah was informedby MC Mahajan and VP Menon (who had flown into Srinagar) that anInstrument of Accession is being fabricated in New Delhi. Obviously,the maharajah could not have signed the instrument earlier thanOctober 27, 1947. The instrument remains null and void, even if themaharajah had actually signed it. The reason, as pointed out byAlastair is that the `signatures' were obtained under coercion. Underlaw, any undertaking secured through coercion or duress is null andvoid. She points out Indian troops had already arrived at and securedSrinagar airfield during the middle of October 1947. On October 26,1947, a further airlift of thousands of Indian troops to Kashmir tookplace. She questions: "Would the maharajah have signed the Instrumentof Accession, had the Indian troops not been on Kashmiri soil?"It is eerie to note that India has never shown the original`Instrument' in any international forum. If India was truthful, itshould have the temerity to present the document to Pakistan or to theUN. Isn't it funny that, in the summer of 1995, the Indian authoritiesreported the original document as lost or stolen? This fact furtherbeclouds authenticity of the document. India took the Kashmir issue tothe UN in 1948 under article 35 of Chapter VI which outlines the meansfor a peaceful settlement of disputes. India avoiding presenting theKashmir case under the UN Chapter VII which relates to acts ofaggression. Obviously, it did so because it knew that the Kashmir wasa disputed state. And, issue of its integration with India or Pakistanremained to be resolved.From the foregoing, it is evident that theInstrument of Accession does not exist. The `accession' of thedisputed state, through a resolution of the puppet assembly, is nulland void. This `resolution' violates the Security Council's directiveforbidding India to forge unilateral 'accession' of the state. ==============================================================================TOPIC: INDIA: Sangh Parivar wants to remove every Christian trace in Orissahttp://groups.google.com/group/sci.military.naval/browse_thread/thread/746122ea41f5a994?hl=en================================================================================ 1 of 1 ==Date: Mon, Oct 27 2008 2:45am From: PakistanPal  by Nirmala CarvalhoChristians are not allowed to pray even in government-run refugeecamps.
