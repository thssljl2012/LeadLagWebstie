Im swamped catching up after Affiliate Summit, but I just wanted to make sure that I took the time to clarify a few things from the most recent issue of Revenue.   First, let me clear up some errors from the Q&#038;A with Commission Junctions General Manager, Kerri Pollard.  It was Circuit City not Citibank that Kerri referenced as filing for bankruptcy in the fall. Also, CJ launched a pay-per-call beta test with Ring Revenue  not CallWave. I believe the confusion may have stemmed from the fact that Ring Revenue was founded by several former employees of CallWave.  Also, the name of Commission Junctions new Director of Compliance &#038; Support Operations, Jeff Ransdell, was misspelled.  Sorry. In addition, I received some feedback from several readers at Affiliate Summit who pointed out that the pull quote we used, when taken out of the context from my lengthy conversation with Kerri, seemed very negative. .CJ has been cleaning the stables for a year  I didnt see it that way when we were doing putting together story  mostly because Kerri was so excited, positive and forthcoming about the changes that had taken place at CJ over the last year. My entire conversation with Kerri revolved around how hard CJ is working to ensure that every team within the organization  including marketing, product management and engineering  is focused and accountable to a customer segment. So, it didnt even occur to me people would read that quote any other way than Kerri intended. I guess as a journalist I should have predicted that and I definitely should have known better. Again, my sincerest apologies to Kerri and her CJ team.  Commission Junction, Kerri Pollard
