I'm looking for a recommendation on a bank that I could access from both South and North America.  I'll be travelling to Peru in a few days and would like to open a bank account that I can access from both my home in North America and my family's home in South America.  I don't necessarily need to have a branch location in N.A. but I need to have the ability to make deposits.  It would be helpful to have a branch in S.A., though.   The home in S.A. is near Chile at the southern end of Peru, if it helps. I looked into CitiBank, but they only list a few branches in Lima.  Thanks for any suggestions!
