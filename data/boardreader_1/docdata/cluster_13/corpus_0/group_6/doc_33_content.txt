 So, what lesson should you learn from this picture? If you cough up extra $ for first class, not only do you get better snacks, you also get a life raft. Coach passengers get to stand on the wing. And then I read that there were 3 Bank of America executives on that plane. I&#8217;m so not a conspiracy theorist. But this made me think. Follow my thinking for a minute. Bank of America received $15B of bailout fund in October and another $10B early this year. Bank of America is currently asking the government for another $15B.  source Now picture this. How can the government send a subtle but effective message to Bank of America that it is now effectively owned by the government, and that it better do what the government asks it to do? Find a flight in which top-level executives are on-board. Put the best pilot around in the cockpit of that flight (see below for his credentials). Send a bunch of (secretly trained) geese on the flight path, and create a near-disaster situation. When was the last time you heard a double engine failure by running into a flock of birds? Oh, I almost forgot. Do this near Hudson river so that there are plenty of opportunities for safe rescue of passengers. Works for me!  The following are excerptsof a CNN article about the US Airways pilot,Chesley B. &#8220;Sully&#8221; Sullenberger III: &#8220;The 57-year-old former Air Force fighter pilot has been flying for more than 40 years, and has been withUS Airwayssince 1980.&#8221; &#8220;The pilot speaks internationally on airline safety, and collaborates with the Center for Catastrophic Risk Management at the University of California-Berkeley, whose researchers look for ways to avoid air disasters.&#8221; &#8220;Sullenberger has a cool, calm and collected style &#8212; honed by decades of flight experience and research on safety issues.&#8221;  Posted in Uncategorized   Tagged: airbus, bailout, bank of america, Chesley Sullenberger, conspiracy theorists, crash, flight 1549, government, government conspiracy, hudson, hudson river, hudson river crash, laguardia, new york, news, plane crash, plane crash hudson, plane in hudson river, us airways, us airways crash, us airways river crash
