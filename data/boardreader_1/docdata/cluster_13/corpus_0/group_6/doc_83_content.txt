 div style=clear:both;/divpI couldn't begin without mentioning The Reserve Bank of Australia cutting interest rates again to 1.0%, to 4.25%, as it continues to aid economic recovery. And if observers are correct more are on the way./ppSo,as interest rates and property prices continue to fall, and more and more properties are being offered at greater discounts, there are some truly excellent opportunities for those who want to take advantage of the current conditions. Couple this with the first-home buyers grant of $14,000 for existing homes and $21,000 for new homes, we have a truly unique buying window of opportunity that only comes along once in our lifetime!/ppMy gut instinct tells me that property prices will continue to fall moderately during the first half of 2009 but will stabilise during the second half of the year./ppRemember that if you are buying property today or in the near future, the valuations are real-time and take into account past price falls./ppCouple this with the ultra-conservative stance that valuers are now taking, this provides a greater opportunity for profit./ppHowever, be aware that this window will not last long and suggest that anyone who is serious about buying property, take advantage of current market conditions sooner rather than later./ppLets take Cairns In Tropical North Queensland for example. You can buy a brand new full 'turn key' house and land package for $309,750 - 5 bedrooms, 1 bathroom amp; double carport. Or a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment, in a complex boasting 5 star facilities 200m from the beach for only $339,000! And if this is your first home, take a further $21,000 off these prices!/ppIts difficult to predict when these conditions and these prices will turn around, but what I do know is this is a truely unique set of circumstances creating perhaps one of the best buying opportunities this century! So if you've been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the bottom or you want to take advantage of the first-home buyers grant, take action now!/pdiv style=clear:both;/divdiv style=clear:both;/divdiv style=clear:both;/divdiv style=clear:both;/divpGus Cheratzu/ppWot Property/ppa rel=nofollow target=_blank href=http://www.wotproperty.com.auhttp://www.wotproperty.com.au/a/ppa rel=nofollow target=_blank href=http://www.hotpropertyinvestments.comhttp://www.hotpropertyinvestments.com/a/pdiv style=clear:both;/divpArticle Source: a rel=nofollow target=_blank href=http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Gus_Cheratzuhttp://EzineArticles.com/?expert=Gus_Cheratzu/a/p
