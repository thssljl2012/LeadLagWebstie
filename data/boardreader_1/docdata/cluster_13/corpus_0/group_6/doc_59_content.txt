 Over the past months I and others have tried to obtain a list of NJI pilots who have signed up to be represented by GPAC. The organizers have refused to reply much less offer the names of the pilots who support the effort. There are a substantial group of NJI pilots who feel that the company management can represent all of us as work rules and scope are ironed out.   Basic work rules are established in the 2007 CBA and LOA 13. Can anyone give just three things which cannot be handled by the managers at Okatie? What is it which requires another group of pilots sitting at the table? A group of pilots who have no power!   Until there is a published list of pilots who have agreed to be represented, the GPAC effort is NULL AND VOID. If the latest press release is correct, more than 247 pilots have signed up. Well, until we see the names of these folks, we say the effort is dead and certainly not legitimate to represent all the Gulfstream drivers.   Is there any reason to keep the list of names private? Maybe I am missing something very important? But in the private emails amongst ourselves, why can't we all know who is in support of our action committee?   The secrecy screams out for truth. No one is comfortable with organizations that operate in the dark, especially when they advertise to &amp;quot;represent&amp;quot; you.   #2278
