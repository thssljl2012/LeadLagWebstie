               My fellow American taxpayers, rejoice with me that you no longer support, aid, or abet the English Evil Empire.US insurance giant AIG have announced that they will not seek to renew their sponsorship of Manchester United when their current deal expires in 2010 and reports suggest the company are trying to negotiate an early end to the deal.AIG were unveiled as United's new shirt sponsor amid great fanfare in 2006 as the club proudly announced a British record shirt sponsorship deal: 56.5 million over four years.  However, the US firm have been hit hard by the global economic downturn and only avoided bankruptcy last autumn when the US federal reserve bailed them out to the tune of $152 billion.I must admit my disappointment, though, with President Obama's failure to provide the American electorate with a promise to rid the global community of the scourge that is Cristiano Ronaldo's diving.No more Ronaldo in our time?YES, WE CAN.Labels: Manchester United, The Evil Empire
