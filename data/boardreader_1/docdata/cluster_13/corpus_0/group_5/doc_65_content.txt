The Curbed Cup, our annual award to the New York City neighborhood of the year, is taking on a different tone in this, its fifth running. West Village, Long Island City, Williamsburg&amp;#151;they've all been done. Instead, we're mixing things up by focusing on the most newsworthy microneighborhoods. Let the eliminations commence!  If there's a theme from 2008 for the Upper Upper East Side&amp;#8212;a swath of land we're defining as East 90th Street up to East Harlem&amp;#8212;it's that things are really, actually happening. New restaurants and stores? Really, actually happening! New mall? Really actually happening? Unfortunately, the pendlum swung both ways: tragic crane collapse? Really, actually happened. Meantime, in another neighborhood undergoing rapid transition, the interior of Long Island City&amp;#8212;aka Dry LICe&amp;#8212;saw more new development per square foot than any place outside of Dubai. So who's moving on to round two? Get your vote on.
