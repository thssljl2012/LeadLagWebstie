Okay he was guilty of, among other things, being criminally stupid. He doesn't appear too concerned.  maybe he is full of some holiday "cheer"'Robber' reports bank heistBy PATRICK FERRELL Staff WriterBOLINGBROOK -- Forget calling an 800 number for customer service. One Bolingbrook man simply dialed 911.Police say John A. Pighee Jr., 58, of 610 Preston Drive was unhappy with the service he received at a Bank of America branch.So, shortly before noon Monday, he picked up his cell phone, called police and reported a robbery at the bank, 111 Lily Cache Lane, while he was there."As odd as it sounds, we took a bank robbery (call) from the bank robber," Lt. Ken Teppel said.Teppel said the man had attempted withdrawing some money that the bank had a hold on. When the bank wouldn't release the funds, "he stated he was going to shut the bank down.""He picked up his cell phone, called 911 and reported that the bank was being robbed," Teppel said. "He never relayed to the employees he was going to rob the bank, and he never showed a weapon."After about 15 to 20 minutes of talking by phone with the branch's employees from the parking lot, police determined the bank was not, in fact, being robbed. They promptly entered the building and arrested Pighee.He was charged with felony disorderly conduct, Teppel said."It was one of the most unusual calls we have received," he said.
