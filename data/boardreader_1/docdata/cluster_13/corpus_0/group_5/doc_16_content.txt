About 5,000 foreclosure notices have gone out in the last two months according to a state senator and he's releasing a list of the top-ten repossessing banks to try to shame them into not make people homeless, you know, for Christmas. He says, "Hopefully, I can shame them into acting. If not, then we need legislation to force them to do something." The top "Subprime Scrooge" is US Banks. Also in the top ten are Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. 1,300 of the homes are in Queens, 569 are in Brooklyn, 214 are in the Bronx, 300 are in Staten Island and 102 are in Manahattan. Happy Holidays. [NYP]
