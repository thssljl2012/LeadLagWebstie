The FBI says suspects in a series of bank robberies in metro Atlanta have been arrested, including three in Mississippi.  Gregory Jones, head of the FBI in Atlanta, says 22-year-old Shantavia Glass of Lithonia surrendered to DeKalb County police after widespread distribution of photographs following Wednesday's holdup of a Bank of America in Lithonia.  McComb, Mississippi police arrested 18-year-old William Berk Harrold of Lithonia, accompanied by a 20-year-old woman, after a traffic stop about 4 a.m. Friday. That led to arrests of 20-year-old Zachery Antonio Harris of Ellenwood and a 16-year-old Duluth male suspect at a McComb hotel.  They are wanted in four DeKalb and Gwinnett County robberies over the past two weeks.(Associated Press)
