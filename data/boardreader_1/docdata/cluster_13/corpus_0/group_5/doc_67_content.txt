As usal Petras mixes quite a bit of hyberbole into his meanderings but nevertheless there is some point to his points. However, not all Madoff's clients were rich but certainly most were. At least Madoff does not seem to have been part of a Jewish conspiracy unless one to defraud rich Jewish charities.Bernard Madoff:Wall Street Swindler Strikes Powerful Blows for Social JusticeBy James PetrasWe never thought he would do this to us, he was one of our people, member of Palm Beach Country Club.December 22, 2008 "Information Clearinghouse" --- Wall Street broker Bernard (Bernie) Madoff, former president of NASDAQ, revered and respected investor confessed to pulling off the biggest fraud in history, a $50 billion dollar scam.  Bernie was known for his generous philanthropy, especially to Zionist, Jewish and Israeli causes.  A one time life-guard on Long Island in the 1960s, Bernie launched his financial career by raising money from colleagues, friends and relatives among wealthier Jews in the Long Island suburbs, Palm Beach, Florida and in Manhattan, promising a modest, steady and secure return of between 10 to 12%, covering any withdrawals in typical Ponzi fashion by drawing on funds from new investors who literally pleaded for Bernie to fleece them.  Madoff personally managed at least $17 billion dollars.  For almost four decades he built up a clientele, which came to include some of the biggest banks and investment houses in Scotland, Spain, England and France; as well as major hedge funds in the United States.  Madoff drew almost all of the funds from high net-worth private clients who were recruited by brokers working on commission.  Bernies clients included many multi-millionaires and billionaires from Switzerland, Israel and elsewhere, as well as the USs largest hedge funds (RMF Division of the Man Group and the Tremont).  Many of the swindled super-rich clients forced their money on Madoff, who sternly imposed rigorous conditions on potential clients:  He insisted they have recommendations from existing investors, deposit a substantial amount and guarantee their own solvency.  Most considered themselves lucky to have their funds taken by the highly respected Wall Streetswindler.  Madoffs standard message was that the fund was closedbut because they came from the same world (board members of Jewish charities, pro-Israel fund raising organizations or the right country clubs) or were related to a friend, colleague or existing clients, he would take their money.            Madoff set up advisory councils with distinguished members, contributed heavily to museums, hospitals and upscale cultural organizations.  He was a prominent member of exclusive country clubs in Palm Beach and Long Island.  His reputation was enhanced by his funds record of never having a losing year  a big selling point in luring millionaire investors.  Madoff shared with his super-rich clients (Jews and Gentiles) a common upper class life style, and mix of cultural philanthropy with low key financial profiteering.  Madoff played his colleagues with a soft-spoken, but authoritative, appearance of expertise, covered by a veneer of upper class collegiality, deep commitment to Zionism and long-term friendships.  Bernies mega-fund shared many signs with recent high level scams: The constant high returns, unmatched by any other broker; a lack of third party oversight; a backroom accounting firm physically incapable of auditing the multi-billion dollar operation; a broker-dealer operation directly under his thumb and the total obfuscation of what he was actually investing in.  The obvious similarity of signs with other fraudsters were overlooked by the rich and famous, the sophisticated investors and high paid consultants, the Harvard MBAs and the entire army of regulators from the Security and Exchange Commissions (SEC) because they were totally embedded in the corrupt culture of take the money and run and if youre making it, dont ask questions.  The reputation of the superior wisdom of a seemingly successful Jewish Wall Streeter fed into the self-delusions of the wealthy and the stereotypes held by millionaire Gentiles.The Big Swindle            Madoffs investment fund only dealt with a limited clientele of multi-millionaire and billionaires who kept their funds in for the long haul; the occasional withdrawal were limited in amount and were easily covered by soliciting new funds from new investors fighting to have access to Madoffs money management.  The long-term big investors looked toward passing their investments to their kin or eventual retirement.  The wealthy lawyers, dentists, surgeons, distinguished Ivy league professors and others who might need to draw from their funds for an occasional fancy wedding or celebrity-studded bar-mitzvah, could draw from their funds because Madoff had no problem covering the withdrawal by attracting funds from rich owners of sweat shop garment factories, dangerous meat packing outfits and slumlords.  Madoff was no Robin Hood, his philanthropic and charity contributions facilitated access to the rich and wealthy who served on the boards of the recipient institutions and proved that he was one of them a kind of super-rich intimate of the same elite class.  The shock, awe and heart attacks that followed Madoffs confession that he was running a Ponzi scheme drew as much anger for the money lost and the fall from the moneyed class as for the embarrassment of knowing that the worlds biggest exploiters and smartest swindlers on Wall Street, were completely taken by one of their own.  Not only did they suffer big losses but their self-image of themselves as rich because they are so smart and of superior stock was utterly shattered:  They saw themselves as suffering the same fate as all the schmucks they had previously swindled, exploited and dispossessed in their climb to the top.  There is nothing worse for the ego of a respectable swindler than to be trumped by a bigger swindler.  As a result, a number of the biggest losers have so far refused to give their names or the amount they lost, working instead through lawyers fighting off other losers.The Positive Side of Madoffs Mega-Swindle (The Inadvertent Hand of Justice)            While it is understandable that the super-rich and wealthy, who have lost a large portion of their retirement and investment funds are unanimous in their condemnation and cries of betrayal of trust, and the editorials of all the prestigious newspapers and weeklies have joined the chorus of moral critics, there is much to praise in Madoffs deeds, even if such praise was not at the heart of his fraudulent endeavor. It is worthwhile to list the inadvertent positive outcomes of Madoffs mega-swindle.  First of all the swindle of $50 plus billion dollars may make a big dent on US Zionist funding of illegal Israeli colonial settlements in the Occupied Territories, lessen funding for AIPACs purchase of Congressional influence and financing of propaganda campaigns in favor of a pre-emptive US military attack against Iran. Most investors will have to lower or eliminate their purchase of Israel bonds, which subsidize the Jewish States military budget. Secondly, the swindle has further discredited the highly speculative hedge funds already reeling from massive withdrawals because of deep losses.  Madoffs funds were one of the last respected operations still drawing new investors, but with the latest revelations it may accelerate their demise.  The dismissed promoters may finally have to perform an honest, productive days work.Thirdly, Madoffs long-term, large-scale fraud was not detected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) despite its claims of at least two investigations.  As a result, there is a total loss of credibility.  More generally, the SECs failure demonstrates the incapacity of capitalist government regulatory agencies to detect mega frauds.  This failure raises the question of whether alternatives to investing in Wall Street are better suited to protect savings and pension funds.Fourthly, Madoffs long-term association with NASDAQ, including his chairmanship, while he was defrauding his clients of billions, strongly suggests that the members and leaders of this stock exchange are incapable of recognizing a crook, and are prone to overlook felonious behavior of one of their own.  In other words, the investing public can no longer look to holders of high posts in NASDAQ as a sign of probity.  After Madoff it may signal time to look for a king-size mattress for safe keeping of what remains of a familys wealth.The fifth point is that the investment advisors from top banks in Europe, Asia and the US managing billions of funds did not carry out the most elementary due diligence of Madoffs operation.  Apart from severe bank losses, tens of thousands of influential, affluent and super-rich lost their entire accumulated wealth.  The result is total loss of confidence in the leading banks and financial instruments as well as the general discrediting of expert knowledge.  The result is a weakening of the financial stranglehold over investor behavior and the demise of an important sector of the parasitic rentier class, which gains without producing any useful commodities or providing needed services. The sixth point is that since most of the money stolen by Madoff came from the upper classes around the world, his behavior has reduced inequalities  he is the greatest leveler since the introduction of the progressive income tax.  By ruining billionaires and bankrupting millionaires, Madoff has lessened their capacity to use their wealth to influence politicians in their favor  thus increasing the potential political influence of the less affluent sectors of class societyand inadvertently strengthening democracy against the financial oligarchs.A seventh point can be made that by swindling life-long friends, self-same ethno-reli...
