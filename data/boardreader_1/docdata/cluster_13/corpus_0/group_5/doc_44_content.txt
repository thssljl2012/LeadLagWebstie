Switch of focus. Today went great.&amp;nbsp; We marched into City Hall right outside the marriage bureau, and then marched to a workers rights rally outside of Bank of America to show support. Gotta say...a protest/picket moved indoors makes things pretty intense.&amp;nbsp; Thank God Andy knows how to negotiate with the police.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;want nothing to do with that aspect of it. &amp;nbsp;And now that this event is over, I've decided to let the actual protest organizing fall into other hands.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;need to focus on rallying the community together. So many organizations exist, yet so many of them work completely alone save funding.&amp;nbsp; How can we say &amp;quot;LGBT&amp;nbsp;COMMUNITY&amp;quot; if we don't act as one?Today was good, though. Today was good.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
