 Saul Steinberg&amp;#8217;s brilliant expressions in the medium of cartoon art have brightened eyes and tickled brains for the better part of a century. (See my previous article on Saul Steinberg.) Romanian born, trained in Milan and other cultural centers of Europe, Steinberg emigrated to the U.S. and became familiar to many Americans through his long time association with The New Yorker; where his humorous, thought provoking, and uncannily clever drawings  delighted readers for over 60 years. Residents of the U.K. now have an opportunity to view some of his original drawings in an exhibition that runs until February 15, 2009 at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London. Those of us in other parts of the world can pick up the exhibition catalog or Joel Smith&amp;#8217;s Steinberg at the New Yorker, or simply search through the New Yorker&amp;#8217;s extensive archives of cartoon art at The Cartoon Bank.
