The economic downturn has hit nearly every sector and every state in America. With the end of the calendar year approaching, and the time for making a charitable gift for the tax year, narrowing, we may not know for a few months how local arts organizations will fare in this tough economic climate. Nevertheless, there are ominous signs:  First the Virginia Symphony cuts salaries. Then they seek a $1 million &amp;#8220;bailout.&amp;#8221;  The Cleveland Orchestra is plugging holes in its budget again. The Indianapolis Symphony needs more money in the bank. The New Mexico Symphony makes cuts. And, the Detroit Symphony&amp;#8217;s fortunes could go from bad to worse.  Washington State tends to lag behind the economic shifts of the rest of the country. Until very recently, Seattle&amp;#8217;s housing market was robust compared to Nevada, California, Florida, and elsewhere. Now the state is facing a budget deficit of at least $6 billion and it could grow by the time lawmakers start writing a new budget for the state. State funding for the arts will probably be slashed. While the Seattle Symphony may be able to survive without significant state funding, there are smaller outfits that may not.
