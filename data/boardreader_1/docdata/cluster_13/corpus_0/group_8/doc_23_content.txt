  From the November 07 Teach Peace newsletter at www.teachpeace.com  MARCH TOWARDS WAR Will we see a US air and sea attack on Iran before President Bush leaves office? The Teach Peace detailed timeline to war available at www.teachpeace.com/Iran.pdf makes the case that war is on the horizon and we do not have much time remaining to prevent it. How do we prevent it? Direct action and let President Bush know that you will not cooperate with his plans to start another war. Everything counts and more than a million lives hang in the balance as the subsequent violence is likely to last many years. Whether you are educating a member of your family, writing to your representatives, working to support a pro-peace candidate, or doing some other non-violent activity, it counts. What we cannot do is sit back and wait for President Bush to leave office. Silence is permission and do not fool yourself that the next president, because he or she may be from another political party, will voluntarily give up excessive executive powers. While time may be running out to impeach President Bush, there is no time limit for prosecuting him for his crimes. For this reason energy invested in the impeachment process will not be wasted. As Chris Floyd, author of Empire Burlesque observed: "Yet we must keep sounding the alarm, even in the face of almost certain defeat. What else is our humanity worth if we don't do that? And if, in the end, all that we've accomplished is to keep the smallest spark of light alive, to help smuggle it through an  age of darkness to some better, brighter time ahead, is that not worth the full measure of struggle?"
