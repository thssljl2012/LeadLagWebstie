So the Sentinel finally decided to write an article about the two banks: Banks warned by Feds By Winston Jones Staff Writer   Two Douglasville banks have received cease and desist warnings from federal regulators calling for several corrective actions to curb problems caused by troubled loans. First Commerce Community Bank and Douglas County Bank were named in separate orders issued in January by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

The FDIC orders call for certain management changes, increased participation by the boards of directors and filing of regular progress reports.    Bill Lumpkin, president/CEO of First Commerce Community Bank, told the Sentinel Tuesday that when the banks customers are not doing well, and their real estate values are not doing well, it hurts the banks financial position. Were part of the economy and this is a reflection on what were all feeling, Lumpkin said. It started in the home business industry and has spread to other parts of the economy. He said the bank is following all the terms of the FDICs order.   The board of directors formed a special committee that meets every two weeks to make sure were responding to the order correctly, he added.

They request a liquidity ratio of 10 or above and were over 17 percent, Mayhew said. Were at 8 percent capital, better than many large banks. He added, We came into this (recession) strong and plan on staying that way. Our goal is to put more capital in the bank and well still be strong when the recession is over.
