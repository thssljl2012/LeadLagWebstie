[quote Lauren '06][quote Trotsky][quote Swampy]Cornell tends to recruit more from Canada than some of these other schools. [s]And everyone in Canada knows Cornell gives athletic scholarships, eh.[/s] International exchange rates can shift a Canadian family's income. For example, today a family making CN$100K is making only US$77,229.[/quote]  I'm missing something.  I would think the dollar being in the toilet would be good for recruiting from Canada.  Since Cornell tuition is paid in $US, and Canadians can get more $US at the exchange now than they used to, Cornell tuition has actually [i]dropped[/i] for Canadians because of the weakening dollar.  Right?[/quote] No, the Canadian dollar is worth less than 78 cents on the American dollar (down from 90 cents in August 2008).  The American dollar has weakened, yes, but the Canadian has gone even worse.  I make out nice because I pay my Canadian rent and tuition from money stored in a US bank.  Those going the other way, not so much.  The only advantage to a weakening Canadian dollar is that they might qualify for more aid.[/quote]  Yeah, my point was only in reference to financial aid, since we were talking about the big-endowment schools covering 100% of need. I'm assuming that Cornell's Financial Aid office does all its calculations in US$, So, even a relatively well-off Canadian family would have more need from the perspective of need-based financial aid. (That is relatively well off if they stay away from imported goods. Then again,they've got socialized medicine so the need in the family budget is less than that of a U.S. player's family. I'm pretty sure the financial aid formula doesn't take into account the level of publicly provided goods in the student's home country. It's too bad some of the coaches back in the '70s and '80s didn't get wise to this and recruit from the Red Army team. ::bang::)
