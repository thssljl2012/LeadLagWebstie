So, despite the efforts of Bill Thompson and at least one other board member, the IDA has approved an estimated $17.8 million in tax breaks for the Related Companies to renovate the Kingsbridge Armory into a gigantic shopping mall.Now, all that's left is for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to be completed (something that will probably get done in the next month or so) and then the project will go through the city's land use review process, which will go through Community Board 7 (which is also working to secure further community benefits), the borough president's office (which has expressed support for benefits agreement) and the City Council (where Majority Leader Joel Rivera has expressed his support for a community benefits agreement). This will take a few months, probably.This is a setback for the Kingsbridge Armory Redevelopment Alliance (KARA). It was hoping to leverage the IDA tax breaks into a community benefits agreement (CBA). But all is not lost; through the land use review process, they will stay be able to make their case that the community should get more out than a shopping center, low-paying retail jobs and some low-cost space for community programming.Specifically, KARA wants Related to require employers at the Armory to pay living wages (about $10 an hour, plus benefits), give job preferences to local residents (during and after construction), offer more community space and allow employees the option to unionize.The living wage requirement would be unprecedented in New York City, but has been included in CBA's for projects in California. Related hasn't talked specifics, but says it's willing to negotiate some type of benefits agreement, as it did for the Gateway Center Mall (the overhaul of the Bronx Terminal Market near Yankee Stadium). Though derided by critics as lacking community input, lacking reserved space for local merchants and being virtually unenforceable, that CBA has produced a good deal of job training and Related has reportedly complied with the terms it signed off on. (There are living wage and minority hiring provisions in the Gateway CBA, but they are not expressly enforceable with regards to the mall's future tenants,)This is a complicated issue, one the Norwood News has reported on extensively and will continue to as the process moves forward. Again, stay tuned.-IDA hearing reporting by Ivonne Salazar
