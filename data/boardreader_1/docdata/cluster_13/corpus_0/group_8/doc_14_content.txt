Passports will be needed to buy mobile phones    Everyone who buys a mobile telephone will be forced to registertheir identity on a national database under government plans to extendmassively the powers of state surveillance.      Webmaster's Commentary:            This is utter nonsense and a total waste of taxpayer funds to create yet another bureaucracy. This requirement will not stop terrorists. We already know from theMumbai attacks that terrorists (or government agents posing asterrorists) can create their own SIM cards to mask the phone'sidentity. Even simpler than that is to have a sympathizer buy a cellphone for the terrorist to use, then claim it was stolen just prior touse (or simply mug a few people and grab their phones).                                        Introducing the 'Iron Eagles' - Awesomely Bad Videos from the Military-Industrial Complex    Then he tosses the globe to a dude in a trenchcoat. He explains thatDIA isn't just interested in enemy armies, terrorists, andnarco-traffickers. "Foreign politics, global economics, and geographic,medical, and health issues" all come under the agency's watchful eye,as well. So does forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and environmentalhazards. Oh, and DIA "reaches out to foreign nationals on the street,"too. Is that Times Square they're showing in the background?    Mandelson 'slimed' by climate protester    Leila Deen from campaign group Plane Stupid said she was protestingat reports that the current business secretary met lobbyists fromHeathrow owner BAA before the government gave the controversialgo-ahead for a third runway at the London airport.      Webmaster's Commentary:            Whenthe theory is against you argue the facts. When the facts are againstyou argue the theory. When both the facts and theories are against you,hurl custard!                                            Olmert faces further charges     Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, should be indicted for an alleged investment scheme, police say. The recommendation to indict Olmert was issued on Thursday, addingmore charges to a series of corruption scandals that have forced hisresignation.    The Judeo-Russian Mafia : From the Gulag to Brooklyn to World Dominion    The very fact that the Jewish mafia (often misnamed the Russianmafia) was capable of completely covering its tracks, being completelyleft out of all news reports surrounding the incident, while the commonpeople (in Russia) were utterly convinced of their complicity, provesthe immense strength of this rather new movement of organized crime.The Jewish mafia is nothing like their Irish or Italian predecessors inits American or European operations. They are richer, moreinternational in scope and far more violent and ruthless. They killchildren. They kill policemen and their families. They kill whomeverthey like. There has been nothing like it before in the history of the globe. And they are just getting started.PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE ECONOMY FOLKS, WE HAVE BREAD AND CIRCUSES AND JACKO FOR YOU!!!!!!!!          Webmaster's Commentary:            ... and maybe we can get O.J., Robert Blake, Robert Wagner, and Bill Shatner to do a chorus line for you!                                            Obama's War    They key to understanding the extent and nature of Obama's betrayalon the issue of the war lies in the fact that this alleged "withdrawal"will be back-loaded. Instead of one combat brigade per month, our forceposture in Iraq will boil down to essentially the same as it would havebeen had Bush stayed in office. The plan is that troops will startleaving Iraq in large number only around next summer, at a pace to beleft up to the field commanders.The dangers of printing money: four lessons from history    The hope is that the money pumped into the economy will encouragebanks to become more relaxed about lending to individuals andbusinesses.Flush with extra cash we will all rush out to spend it, kickstartingthe economy and dragging it out of recession. Governor of the Bank ofEngland, Mervyn King, will get a well deserved knighthood, and the restof us will all breathe a sigh of relief and carry on as before, alittle poorer, a little wiser, but generally OK. But, none of the above is certain.    Mauritania tells Israel embassy to leave    Mauritania has ordered staff at Israel's embassy to leave thecountry within 48 hours after freezing ties with the Jewish state overits invasion of Gaza, a senior Mauritanian official said on Friday.      Webmaster's Commentary:                                    "MAURITANIA IS FILLED WITH AL QAEDA! MAURITANIA IS FILLED WITH AL QAEDA! INVADE! INVADE NOW!!!" -- Israel                Bill Seeks to Let FDIC Borrow up to $500 Billion         Senate BankingCommittee Chairman Christopher Dodd is moving to allow the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. to temporarily borrow as much as $500 billionfrom the Treasury Department.The Connecticut Democrat's effort -- which comes in response tourging from FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- would give the FDICaccess to more money to rebuild its fund that insures consumers'deposits, which have been hard hit by a string of bank failures.BailoutMoney - Instead of Being Used to Stabilize the Economy or Even theBailed-Out Companies - is Just Going to Line the Pockets of the Wealthy        he bailoutmoney is just going to line the pocket of the wealthy, instead ofhelping to stabilize the economy or even the companies receiving thebailouts: * Bailout money is being used to subsidize companies run byhorrible business men, allowing the bankers to receive fat bonuses, toredecorate their offices, and to buy gold toilets and prostitutes    * A lot of the bailout money is going to the failing companies' shareholders * Indeed, a leading progressive economist says that the truepurpose of the bank rescue plans is "a massive redistribution of wealthto the bank shareholders and their top executives"Different name, same stink    I mention this now because the group just issued a piece aimed atthe private military contractor Blackwater Worldwide. Or thats what itused to be called. The company founded by Michigan native Erik Princehas changed its name to Xe (pronounced Zee).I got a good laugh out of a cartoon accompanying the story posted onthe watchdog groups Web site. It shows three bugs around a desk in aPR firms office, with one of the creepy-crawlers saying, First ofall, we want our name changed from cockroach to companion beetle. That pretty much captures the rationale behind the name change.Investigator Details Bernie Madoffs Relationship With Organized Crime        Ponzi schemefinancier Bernard Madoff should feel fortunate that he got nabbed whenhe did. Now under house arrest in his $7 million Manhattan penthouse,he could be lying in a pine box, six feet under if some of the peoplehe crossed got their hands on him. Former funds manager Harry Markopolos told a House FinancialServices subcommittee on Feb. 4 that Madoff had cheated some extremelydangerous figures out of millions of dollars.KO Countdown : Bush 090304 : Administration Violated Rights                        Webmaster's Commentary:            We need executions, as a deterrent to future dictator wannabes. And by the way, from the period of 2000 to 2008, we DID know thiscountry was a dictatorship because WE HERE IN THE BLOG-O-SPHERE WERETELLING YOU IT WAS and ABCNNBBCBS didn't want to listen.                                        Baxter: flu shots sent to Germany, Slovenia and the Czech Repulic contained live bird flu virus    People familiar with biosecurity rules are dismayed by evidence thathuman H3N2 and avian H5N1 viruses somehow co-mingled in the Orth-Donaufacility. That is a dangerous practice that should not be allowed tohappen, a number of experts insisted.Accidental release of a mixture of live H5N1 and H3N2 viruses could have resulted in dire consequences. While H5N1 doesnt easily infect people, H3N2 viruses do. If someoneexposed to a mixture of the two had been simultaneously infected withboth strains, he or she could have served as an incubator for a hybridvirus able to transmit easily to and among people. That mixing process, called reassortment, is one of two ways pandemic viruses are created.      Webmaster's Commentary:                                    Did we all just dodge a depopulation bullet? I mean, this combination of H5N1 with H3N2 could not be more deadlyif it was designed that way, combining the lethal but hard to transmitH5N1 with the more easily transmitted H3N2? As a side note, many researchers are now convinced that the HIVvirus was accidentally created during the mass smallpox vaccinationprogram in the 1950s (before reassortment was understood) when cowpoxtaken from cows with bovine leukemia were cultured on livers taken fromsheep with the visna virus. The bovine leukemia and sheep viruses weremerged under those conditions, creating a new virus, which to this dayshows features of both original viruses. Remember "Spanish Flu", which actually appeared on US military basesat the end of WWI and was spread to the rest of the world by infectedUS soldiers transferred to foreign bases ( I guess those trenchesdidn't kill off enough surplus population).                    W4 Resistance - You don't believe in war, why pay for it?    Be advised that unless you can really claim no tax liability (suchas by having a very low income or a lot of deductible losses), the IRSwill consider this to be tax evasion and you will be hassled. Althoughthe IRS no longer requires the employer to send in W4 forms withgreater than 9 exemptions, the IRS will consider the validity of theclaims when the W2 reports from the employer are received. At thatpoint the IRS can tell the employer to reduce the number of exemptions,so your W4 resistance may be short lived unless you change jobs or havean employer willing to resist with y...
