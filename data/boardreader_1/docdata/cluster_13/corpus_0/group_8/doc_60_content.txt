A year later and millions of Americans are dead and the nation&#8217;s infrastructure lies in tatters. The World Bank declares America a developing nation. Europe, Scandinavia, China and Japan are also struggling to recover from the same fateful event - a violent storm, 150 million kilometres away on the surface of the sun.&#8220; dooooooooooooooooooooooooooom! : )
