     With the faltering economy, lay-offs, collapsed investment and brokerage houses, failed banks and decimated funds many of my elder law clients are forced to look elsewhere for their future financial security.  On Long Island, the biggest asset of many of my clients is their home, despite the hit that our real estate values have taken in the New York City vicinity. Accordingly, reverse mortgages application numbers are gaining, despite the havoc wreaked upon us by the sub-prime mortgage industry.  Newsday recently published this article that laid out the basics of a reverse mortgage. Last week, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that will increase the reverse mortgage lending limit to $625,000 on Long Island for 2009. If a reverse mortgage is something that may help you or a family member, you should check with your local bank regarding a reverse mortgage specialist.  Many bank branches, such as Bank of America who took over Countrywides Reverse Mortgage Division, have reverse mortgage specialists on staff who can advise how much equity you would be entitled to out of your home: the Bank of America/Countrywides Reverse Mortgage Division can be reached at 866-852-2642.
