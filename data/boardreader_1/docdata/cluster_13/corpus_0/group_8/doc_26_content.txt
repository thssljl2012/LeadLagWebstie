Guess who's in line for nearly a million bucks via earmark in the budget?Can you say, La Raza?  Sure you can:Perhaps the most controversial is a direct earmark for a Hispanic civil-rights group -- the National Council of La Raza -- worth $950,000. The group has been a lighting rod of controversy since it helped organize large protests in 2006 aimed at derailing efforts by conservative congressional Republicans to enforce U.S. immigration laws. La Raza, which opposes raids and other aggressive law enforcement tactics, says that the federal money will go solely to its community action subsidiary, the Raza Development Fund, which it says provides loans for housing, education, and healthcare centers in Hispanic areas, according to information on the groups website.  La Raza says that most of the funds money comes from private financial institutions, including Bank of America and Citibank.  The late Rep. Charles Norwood (R-Ga.) first criticized earmarks for La Raza in 2005 in the magazine Human Events saying federal money shouldnt be used for groups who dont support U.S. laws. We ought not to send taxpayer's money to people who absolutely advocate . . . using that money for the country not to follow the law of the land and not to secure our country's borders, Norwood wrote.I've said it before and it keeps getting truer and truer...the Democrats and this administration are actively endorsing law-breaking - be it encouraging people to break into foreclosed properties, paying off groups engaged in widespread voter fraud, or groups that encourage spending tax money on benefits for illegal aliens.Explain to me how this is a good thing?
