 I was on the CBA website today and noticed they have changed their look. According to the press release, the new logo was formally launched at the Mid-Winter Meeting on February 21st, and the new website look was rolled out on February 23rd.  In the March 2009 issue of CBA&#8217;s National magazine (page 44), it explains: A new brand strategy, complete with a revamped CBA logo, branding compaign and refocused strategy, was unveiled by CBA President Guy Joubert of Winnipeg. Developed under the guidance of a Brand Advisory Group that reported to the CBA&#8217;s Membership and Communications committees, the new brand will apply to all corporate and marketing communications across the organization. According to the story, the new look will be adopted into the various CBA communication vehicles throughout this month. More details will be forthcoming in the April/May 2009 issue of National.
