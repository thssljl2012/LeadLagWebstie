Oil prices are hitting one new record after another just as summer energy demand is about to peak and worries about inflation are mounting. It is a big change from three months ago. The second quarter began with high hopes that the worst of the credit crunch was over, earnings growth would pick up as the year went on and stocks would rise. Those hopes were shattered as the effects of the credit crisis lingered and it looked like consumers might stop spending. Investors acknowledged the grim reality beginning in mid-May. That is when the Dow Jones Industrial Average began its march downward, ending the quarter (including Monday&amp;#8217;s slim 3.50-point gain) with an overall loss of 912.88 points, or 7.4%, at 11350.01 &amp;#8212; and perilously close to the 20% decline from a recent high that is considered the start of a bear market. It was the third straight quarterly decline and the worst second quarter since 2002. In each of the final two trading sessions of the quarter, the Dow industrials tipped into bear-market territory during the day but closed just shy of the mark. The Dow industrials have fallen 19.9% from their October 2007 record, so any coming session with a loss could mark the official &amp;#8220;bear&amp;#8221; for stocks.       Rusty Zimmerman    The worst-performing stocks reflected the credit crisis and its implications for consumer spending. Financials led the way down as banks big and small took write-downs and reported disappointing earnings. Dow component American International Group Inc. was off about 39% in the quarter, and Bank of America Corp. fell 37%. The Dow Jones Wilshire Bank Index fell nearly 26%. But the biggest loser among the Dow industrials for the quarter was auto maker General Motors Corp., which dropped about 40%. Of 30 Dow components, 24 ended the quarter in the red. The few bright spots included Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., which rose as crude-oil prices soared 38% to more than $140 a barrel. Even after a small gain Monday, the Dow industrials are down more than 14% this year and it appears that the first-half problems weighing on stocks are likely to persist to the end of 2008. Many analysts believe that a rebound in home prices would be the clearest sign that the credit crisis is over, but housing inventories are still high and few expect a sustained rise in prices soon. Soaring oil prices are both a threat to economic growth and a potential cause of inflation. Rising energy prices discourage consumer spending on other goods and services and at the same time can translate into higher prices for products that use oil as a feedstock and for goods transported long distances. Despite increased scrutiny by regulators and legislators, oil remains a popular target for speculative buyers, which could drive prices even higher. &amp;#8220;A year ago, people didn&amp;#8217;t recognize all the potholes,&amp;#8221; said Bill King, chief market strategist at M. Ramsey King Securities in Burr Ridge, Ill. &amp;#8220;Now they do, and everyone is wondering how we get out.&amp;#8221; Heavy users of energy are likely to continue to suffer. U.S. refinery capacity remains constrained, with production of fuel oil and other distilled products especially limited. Even if overseas oil producers raise production, as Saudi Arabia did, prices of those refined fuels could stay high. Prices for food and other commodities have been rising along with oil. After seven interest-rate cuts since last September, Federal Reserve policy makers held rates steady at their latest meeting amid speculation that there could be rate increases later in the year to curb inflation.  Some on Wall Street worry that higher interest rates could choke off what little forward momentum the economy has been able to muster lately. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s like we&amp;#8217;re in a rain delay, waiting for a recession to start,&amp;#8221; said Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#8217;s Corp. strategist Sam Stovall.  The third quarter will offer many distractions. The official presidential campaign heats up, and investors will be digesting specific proposals on issues that affect corporate profits, including trade, taxes, health care and defense spending. The summer Olympics will put the spotlight on China, pointing to the good and bad of that country&amp;#8217;s explosive growth. But the problems that have plagued the market in the last half of the second quarter aren&amp;#8217;t going away. Financial firms are still raising billions in new capital to shore up their books and warning of fresh red ink to come &amp;#8212; signs that the credit crisis is far from finished. In the weeks ahead, there will be a raft of earnings announcements. According to Thomson Reuters, analysts expect aggregate earnings at S&amp;amp;P 500 companies to be down 11% for the second period, led by a 60% swoon in financial-sector earnings. Estimates fell sharply as the quarter progressed. On April 1, analysts were expecting a 2% drop in S&amp;amp;P earnings and a 31% decline in the financial sector. &amp;#8220;The perception was that the financials would start to turn things around by this point,&amp;#8221; said analyst Ashwani Kaul of Thomson Reuters. &amp;#8220;That turnaround hasn&amp;#8217;t happened.&amp;#8221; Stocks peaked in May after the Fed took steps to shore up battered investment banks and backed J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;amp; Co.&amp;#8217;s acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos. The Dow was up nearly 9% for the quarter on May 2, before starting its steady decline about two weeks later as worries returned. The Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#8217;s 500-stock index ended the quarter down 42.70 points, or 3.2%, at 1280.00, also close to bear-market territory. The technology-stock heavy Nasdaq Composite, however, rose 13.88 points to 2292.98, although it is off nearly 20% from its October 2007 high and more than 50% below its record close in March 2000. An exchange-traded fund tracking the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#8217;s financial sector was down 18.5%, the worst performance of any category. Regional banks were hit especially hard as investors bet that the credit fallout won&amp;#8217;t be limited to Wall Street&amp;#8217;s major players. Fifth Third Bancorp plummeted 51% in the second quarter, National City Corp. fell 52%, and Zions Bancorp dropped 31%. Of nine S&amp;amp;P 500 sector ETFs, the four that posted gains in the second quarter offered a glimpse into investors&amp;#8217; defensive mind-set and risks that linger for the U.S. economy. The technology category was up 2.3%, largely because it derives a bigger chunk of its earnings from overseas activity than other categories within the S&amp;amp;P. The S&amp;amp;P&amp;#8217;s utilities sector, traditionally an investor haven, rose 7.3% in the quarter. The best category was the energy sector, which jumped about 20%, lifted by crude oil&amp;#8217;s rally. Other commodities were also stronger in the quarter, which helped the basic-materials sector rise 3.9%. Most traders aren&amp;#8217;t taking any chances, making defensive bets as they look for signs of an end to the woes plaguing both the stock market and the broader economy. The stock market typically hits bottom &amp;#8220;at the very moment when the world seems like it&amp;#8217;s coming to an end,&amp;#8221; said David Kotok, president of the money-management firm Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, N.J. &amp;#8220;We still don&amp;#8217;t seem to have reached level of true panic,&amp;#8221; leading to a round of last-ditch selling known as capitulation that traditionally paves the way for a market rally. Mr. Kotok said problems in the credit markets must be resolved before the stock market can mount a sustained rise. &amp;#8220;The credit markets aren&amp;#8217;t just dysfunctional right now, they&amp;#8217;re nonfunctional,&amp;#8221; he said.
