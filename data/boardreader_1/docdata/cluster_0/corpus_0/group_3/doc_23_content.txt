By Larry Swing Overnight Global News    The European DJ Stoxx 50 this morning is trading -2.83% as the European markets catch up with the sharp loss in US stocks seen yesterday. Asia-Pacific stocks today closed sharply lower on yesterday's US stock market loses: Japan -11.41%, Hong Kong -4.80%, China -4.88%, Taiwan -3.25%, Australia -6.67%, Singapore -5.25%, South Korea -9.55%, Bombay -2.11%.   UBS today received a $59 billion support package from the Swiss government and credit-default swaps on UBS fell by 26 bp to 124 bp. As part of the deal, UBS is spinning off its toxic US mortgage securities into a separate, government-supported fund, which will leave UBS with no exposure to US mortgage securities going forward. UBS's stock price is up 2% today. Switzerland's other major bank, Credit Suisse, did a private capital raise today that substantially improved its capital ratios. Credit Suisse is up 7% today. Merrill Lynch today reported a loss of $5.58 per share ($5.15 billion), which was larger than market expectations for a loss of $5.18. Merrill Lynch is in the process of being acquired by Bank of America in a stock swap deal. Citigroup this morning reported a Q3 loss of 60 per share ($2.8 billion), which was smaller than the analyst consensus for a loss of $3.8 billion.   Interbank Libor rates continued lower today, as they have each day this week, after central banks injected $254 billion in funding today. The overnight dollar Libor rate fell by 20 bp to 1.94% and the 3-month dollar Libor rate fell by 5 bp to 4.50%. The 3-month Euribor rate fell 8 bp to 5.09%.    Unemployment claims Today's weekly initial unemployment claims report is expected to fall 8,000 to 470,000, adding to last week's decline of 20,000 to 478,000. Last week's decline was tied to the reversal of hurricane effects from Ike and Gustav. Initial claims are only mildly below the 7-year high of 498,000 posted in the last week of September, indicating that the rate of layoffs is currently as high as the peaks seen in the past several recessions. Meanwhile, weekly continuing claims are expected to rise +11,000 to 3.670 million, adding to last week's +56,000 increase to 3.659 million. Continuing unemployment claims (3.659 million) are currently at a 5-year high and within the next month or two are likely to exceed the last cyclical peak of 3.790 million posted in November 2001. Hopefully, the number of people on unemployment during this cycle will not exceed the record high of 4.689 million posted in October 1982. In any case, the US labor market is destined to get much worse over the next few months as businesses lay off employees to prepare for a deep and possibly long recession.   CPI Today's Sep CPI report is expected to show small increases of +0.1% m/m overall and +0.2% m/m on a core basis. That would follow the August report of 0.1% m/m overall and +0.2% m/m core. On a year-on-year basis, the Sep CPI is expected to ease to +5.0% from +5.4% in August and from the 7-1/2 year high of +5.6% posted in July. The Sep core CPI is expected to be unchanged from August at +2.5% y/y. The core CPI of +2.5% is currently in the middle of the 2-year range of +2.1% to +2.9%. The core CPI has been at or above the generally-accepted +2.0% ceiling for inflation since late 2004. However, the Fed will soon be turning its attention more to the possibility of deflation than inflation. There is a danger that the Fed has already fallen into the liquidity trap in which the Fed is just pushing on the string and its monetary policy has no impact on stimulating the economy since consumers and businesses do not want to spend or borrow money. The Bank of Japan was in a liquidity trap during Japan's lost decade in the 1990s when the BOJ's super-easy monetary policy had no effect on stimulating the economy or counteracting deflationary pressures. Japan only recovered after cleaning up its banking problems, boosting exports, and maintaining a super-easy monetary policy that still exists to this day (and can be blamed in part for stimulating global asset prices through the yen carry trade).    Industrial production Today's Sep industrial production report is expected to show a sharp decline of -0.8%, adding to the -1.1% decline seen in August. The US manufacturing sector most likely has a long way to go before bottoming out. Industrial production in August fell by 1.5% y/y, which is substantially better than the trough of 5.7% y/y posted in Nov 2001 during the last recession. The largest year-on-year decline in industrial production in post-war history was 12.4% posted in May 1975. Philadelphia Fed Today's Oct Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index is expected to fall13.8 points to 10.0, reversing most of September's +16.5 point climb to 3.8. A weaker-than-expected report today would not be surprising given that yesterday's Oct NY Empire manufacturing index plunged to 24.6 from 7.4 in September, which was much weaker than market expectations for a small decline to 10.0. All the economic sentiment survey data for October is likely to demonstrate the panic that struck the country as the US experienced the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The only hope at this point is that the facts of the ground do not turn out to be as bad as October sentiment surveys will likely suggest.   NAHB housing index Today's Oct NAHB housing market index is expected to fall 1 point to 17, reversing half of the small +2 point upward rebound to 18 seen in September. The index posted a record low of 16 in July and August and then recovered by 2 points in September. The index is now likely to fall to new record lows given the credit crisis that arose in full force in October. Sentiment among US homebuilders has been falling to new record lows during most of this year, and can only get worse now that the credit crisis has eliminated any hope of a bottoming out for the US housing market for at least several more quarters.   Overnight U.S. Stock News    December S&amp;Ps this morning are trading +11.00 points on some short-covering after yesterday's very steep losses. The US stock market yesterday sold off throughout the day and finished sharply lower (Dow -7.87%, S&amp;P 500 -9.03%, Nasdaq Composite -8.47%).    Bearish factors for stock prices yesterday included (1) weaker-than-expected US retail sales in Sep that fell for the third consecutive month and showed the largest monthly decline (-1.2% m/m) in 3 years, (2) the drop in manufacturing in the New York area to its lowest level (-17.2 to -24.6) since the inception of the Empire manufacturing index in July 2001, (3) comments from Fed Chairman Bernanke that a US economic recovery "will not happen right away," (4) the Fed's Beige Book that said "economic activity weakened in September across all 12 Federal Reserve districts," and (5) the prediction from Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney that the banking industry is "at least several quarters away" from stabilizing and that surging mortgage foreclosures may hurt banks even after the US Treasury bolsters their capital by investing $250 billion as the bank rescue plan is not a "panacea" solution.   Bullish factors for stock prices yesterday included (1) the drop in the 3 month dollar Libor rate for the third straight day, its longest stretch of declines in 7 weeks, a sign that the short-term lending markets are beginning to thaw, (2) the drop in corporate short-term borrowing rates for the second straight day, a sign that efforts by worldwide governments to unlock credit markets may be starting to take hold, (3) the plunge in crude oil prices to a 13-1/2 month low and in gasoline prices to a 19-1/2 month low, and (4) the action by the SEC in agreeing to back an effort by banks in which they may delay writedowns on some securities by accounting for perpetual preferred securities as debt, allowing them to postpone writing down their values.    EBay (EBAY) is down 5% in European trading this morning after cutting its earnings and sales guidance  Today's U.S. Market Focus    December 10-year T-notes this morning are trading +4 ticks. December T-note prices yesterday closed -5.5 ticks at a 2-1/2 month low. Bearish factors for T-note prices yesterday included (1) the steepening of the yield curve as the long-end of the curve (10 year and 30-year) remains under pressure as the market anticipates a heavy increase of Treasury supply in order to fund the myriad of government rescue programs, and (2) the larger-than-expected increase in the core PPI for Sep (+0.4% m/m and a 15-1/2 year high of +4.0% y/y versus expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.8% y/y). Bullish factors for T-note prices yesterday included (1) the larger-than-expected decline in Sep retail sales (-1.2% m/m and -0.6% less autos versus expectations of -0.7% and -0.2% less autos), (2) the larger-than-expected decline in the Oct Empire manufacturing index to a record low for the series that began in July 2001 (-17.2 to -24.6 versus expectations of -2.6 to -10.0), (3) the prediction from Boston Fed President Rosengren that the unemployment rate in the US may rise as the economy in the coming quarters expands at an anemic rate, (4) comments from San Francisco Fed President Yellen that "the US economy appears to be in a recession," and (5) comments from Fed Chairman Bernanke that government efforts to calm financial markets and stem the credit crisis probably won't result in an immediate economic rebound.    The dollar is mixed with this morning with the dollar/yen up +0.53 yen and the euro/dollar up +0.11 cents. The dollar index yesterday closed mildly higher. Bullish factors for the dollar yesterday included (1) continued movement out of the euro and into the dollar on risk aversion as the ECB may have to cut interest rates more than the Fed as the European economy continues to weaken, and (2) the action by the ECB in accepting lower-rated securities in a wider range of currencies in another effort to unfreeze the credit markets.
