With Wall Street sharply lower in early trading, London's leading shares remain under pressure.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 200 points in the first half hour or so, despite better than expected retail sales for January.

The poor performance from Wall Street failed to improve things, and the index is currently 89.96 points lower at 4144.30.British LandRio Tintoguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009   Use of this content is subject to our Terms &amp; Conditions   More Feeds
