 Argentina's national statistics institute says economic growth slowed to 7.5 percent in the second quarter of the year. Year-over-year growth slowed from 8.4 percent in the first quarter as the manufacturing and construction sectors cooled. The service sector showed strong gains, with transportation growing 12.6 percent, and the financial servicing sector 23 percent. Since 2003, Argentina has experienced growth of more than 8 percent per year. But economists warn growth will be curbed by the falling price of soy and other top exports. Exports fell 1.8 percent over a year earlier, while imports grew 22.8 percent. Investment bank Barclays Capital said Thursday that second quarter gains are in line with expectations of 7 percent growth in 2008.
