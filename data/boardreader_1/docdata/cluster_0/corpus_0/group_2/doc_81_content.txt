Stock sell-offs are pushing crude prices lower, while Hurricane Ike is boosting gas prices near term.By Jim OstroffSeptember 16, 2008Prices of oil and motor fuel will do a loopdeloop the rest of Septemberas some investors spooked by Wall Streets financial crisis liquidate their commodities holdings and others rush in to scoop up bargains.Crude oil prices likely will gyrate from around $85 a barrel to more than $100 a barrel, even though the global supply and demand situation is hardly changed from what it was in August. "In this severe reaction to a financial crisis of historic proportions, oil no longer is seen as the safe haven for investments," which is prompting institutions and investors to sell off oil contacts, says John Kilduff, a senior vice president with MFGlobal, a commodities trading firm.Oil prices are being pummeled by a wave of selling on Wall Streetof stocks and futures in nearly every sector amid a severe crisis in the financial services sector. So far this week, markets are absorbing the bankruptcy filing of legendary Wall Street investment banking firm Lehman Brothers, the shotgun wedding of beleaguered Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and the likely sale of insurance titan American International Group. Worries that other Wall Street titans will go belly-up have fueled persistent pessimism among investors.Adding to the downward pressure on oil prices is the fact that dire warnings that Hurricane Ike would destroy Gulf of Mexico oil rigs, which produce more than 1 million barrels a day, proved groundless. Based on initial oil company assessments, just 10 out of 3,800 gulf platforms appeared to have been damaged compared with the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, when 108 platforms were ruined.Prices at the pump will continue to move higher in the near termas temporary disruptions to refineries and pipelines caused by Hurricane Ike crimp supplies. Look for gasoline to continue on its glide upward to as much as $3.95 a gallon on average nationwide during the coming week or so, 35 more than the prevailing cost just prior to Ike's landfall into the heart of the U.S. refining industry. Diesel fuel prices could go up around 10-20 from their current $4.20 a gallon level, mainly due to sporadic spot shortages of the fuel in the Midwest.Even so, a crash in oil and fuel prices isn't any more likely to happen than were the frantic predictions in late spring that prices would soar to $200 a barrel or more this year because of supply shortages, which never materialized. With the economies of India and China still growing strongly, demand for oil and fuels won't crater, especially with China's move this week to cut interest rates to spur its economy.We see oil prices rebounding to around $100 a barrel by early fallwith the intervention of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. "OPEC is comfortable with oil priced at $100 a barrel, even down to the mid-$80 range, but it won't blush at cutting production if it appears oil prices are headed to the $50 range," says Kilduff.We expect crude oil to end the year around $100 a barrel; gasoline, at $3.35 or so per gallon; and diesel, at about $4 a gallon. In 2009, oil prices should average about $100 per barrel, down around 15% from this years average.Look for gas prices at the pump to average around $3.40 a gallon in 2009,20 or so less than this year, although a summer time peak of about $3.75 is likely. Diesel fuel prices should average near $4.15 a gallon, roughly 15 less than this year, with a summertime peak around $4.50.For weekly updates on topics to improve your business decisionmaking,click here.This page printed from: http://www.kiplinger.com/businessresource/forecast/archive/wall_street_woes_affect_oil_markets_080916.html
