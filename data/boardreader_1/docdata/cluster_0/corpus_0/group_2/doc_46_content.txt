Dollar slips amid US fiscal worriesBy Peter GarnhamCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2008Published: September 22 2008 10:41   Last updated: September 22 2008 10:41The dollar lost ground on Monday amid fears over the US fiscal position following the US governments plan to create a $700bn fund to buy toxic assets from banks and thereby ease the credit squeeze.Analysts said the measures would lead to a significant deterioration of the fiscal position of the US relative to other economies and should be negative for the dollar.The dollar fell 0.7 per cent to $1.4566 against the euro, lost 0.6 per cent to $1.8421 against the pound and eased 0.9 per cent to Y106.43 against the yen.The dollar also dropped 0.4 per cent to $0.8362 against the Australian dollar and lost 0.3 per cent to $0.6896 against the New Zealand dollar.Analysts said the dollar had also suffered as the announcement of the plan soothed investors nerves and boosted risk appettite.This was likely to slow the pace of dollar repatriation by US investors seen amid the recent turmoil, they said.A large part of the dollars strength in recent months has been driven by the repatriation of funds from emerging markets markets due to high levels of risk aversion, said David Woo at Barclays Capital.The abatement of risk aversion in the near-term should slow these repatriation flows.
