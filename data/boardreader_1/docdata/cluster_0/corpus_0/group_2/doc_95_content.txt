US retail sales fall unexpectedlyBy Daniel Pimlott in New YorkCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2008Published: September 12 2008 15:15   Last updated: September 12 2008 15:15US retail sales stores fell last month for the second month in a row as the boost from tax rebates slipped away and a sharp decline in energy prices failed to encourage consumers to spend on other goods, data from the Commerce Department showed on Friday.Retail sales fell 0.3 per cent in August, against economists expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise.Sales fell 0.7 per cent excluding volatile automobile and parts, which increased for the first time this year, while sales figures for July and June were revised down sharply.The drop was led by a 2.5 per cent fall in spending at petrol stations, while sales of building materials, as well as discretionary goods like electronics and clothing, also fell.The sharp fall in sales signals that consumer spending has failed to hold up since the government completed its $100bn stimulus of cheques to consumers in the summer, while consumers are wary of spending extra disposable cash freed up by falling energy prices over fears about the wider economic outlook.Retail sales declined for the second consecutive month in August, as the positive benefits from the fiscal stimulus rebates faded quickly into the sunset, said Brian Bethune, an economist at Global Insight.While prices at the petrol pump fell consumers showed little inclination to increase spending in other categories, evidently concerned about weak employment, tight credit conditions, and declining home values, said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Bank of America. The report indicates very soft consumption this quarter.Sharply slowing consumer spending is likely to dent third quarter economic growth, after the second quarter was bolstered by spending following the tax rebates. A weakening trade environment, as other major economies in Japan and Europe experience a more rapid slowdown than the US, could also hit growth.The fall in retail sales came as producer prices fell 0.9 per cent in August, with energy prices falling after rising 1.2 per cent in July. The decline was steeper than the 0.5 per cent drop economists expected, led by a 4.6 per cent drop in energy prices, the biggest in almost two years.The drop in producer prices was the biggest since October 2006. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, producer prices grew by 0.2 per cent, or 3.6 per cent up compared with the same time last year.Inflation is likely to trend lower as commodity prices continue to cool and slack develops in the economy, said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Lehman Brothers.
