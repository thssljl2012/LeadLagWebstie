                My ES TREND Chart above...Price on the ES has taken a hit, after news of the failed talks between Lehman Brothers &amp;amp; Barclays had been made known over the weekend.Last Friday's market action pointed to some more upside(before turning down again) for the ES but with this downward spike, the risks to the down side has increased again, barring any positive news for Lehman's survival.
