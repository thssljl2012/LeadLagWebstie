Oil prices tumbled to a seven-month low Monday as the demise of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch fed expectations that another big liquidation of commodities holdings might lay ahead.Crude's steep decline - prices tumbled as much as $7 over the weekend - also came as early signs suggested that Hurricane Ike delivered less damage than feared to the Gulf Coast energy oil and gas infrastructure.Light, sweet crude for October delivery fell $3.57, or 3.53 percent, to $97.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier dropping to $94.13, the lowest level since Feb. 14. A close at that level would be oil's first settlement under $100 since March 4.Crude has fallen about $50 - or 35 percent - from its all-time trading record of $147.27 reached July 11 as a global economic slowdown continues to weigh on demand for energy.The sell-off in oil began Sunday and accelerated Monday as traders digested a day of dramatic upheaval on Wall Street: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a 158-year-old investment bank, filed for bankruptcy after failing to find a buyer and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to be bought out by Bank of America Corp.
