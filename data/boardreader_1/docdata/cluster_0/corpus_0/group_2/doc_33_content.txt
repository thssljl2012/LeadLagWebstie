Goldman Sachs is generally pretty bullish on crude oil price targets. As recently as 3 September they were predicting oil will reach $149/barrel by the end of 2008. Now the news wires report that Goldman Sachs has cut its average 2009 US crude oil forecast by $25 to $123/barrel. From Upstream Online,  &amp;#8220;We stand by our bullish view on oil, but just think it will now take longer  to get to our previous price targets,&amp;#8221; Reuters quoted the bank&amp;#8217;s commodity  research team saying in a note to clients. &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;The overshoot in June and July increased the forward price elasticity of  demand (making demand more price sensitive) and restrained economic activity,&amp;#8221;  the note, released yesterday, said. Goldman also cut its three-month forecast to $115 a barrel from $149, and its  six-month target to $125 a barrel from $142. The continuing meltdown in the financial markets has left investors moving from oil to safer investments. &amp;#8220;The market has overshot to the downside and is now substantially oversold as  &amp;#8230; financial concerns, scepticism, and real and perceived demand weakness  (have) pushed prices below the long-term economics of the petroleum industry,&amp;#8221;  Goldman added. While maintaining a bullish stance for oil, Goldman&amp;#8217;s analysts led by Jeffrey  Currie said prices could drop to $75 a barrel in the event of a global  recession, which Goldman said it viewed as relatively unlikely. &amp;#8220;However, given the tight inventory situation and high price volatility,  should shortages develop this autumn &amp;#8230; we believe that the market could spike  $10 to $15 a barrel higher than our targets,&amp;#8221; it also said. Price spikes of that magnitude (8% - 12%) are well outside of historical norms, and would indicate that crude oil prices are now acting in a non-Gaussian manner. We may be reaching a break point where crude oil prices start swinging wildly without a smooth baseline average. This would be similar to the crude oil prices in the late 1800s when crude oil went through several boom and bust cycles. Goldman&amp;#8217;s previous $148 forecast for 2009 was the highest in a Reuters poll  of more than 30 analysts late last month. The new target of $123 still puts it  above that poll&amp;#8217;s mean of $113.21 a barrel, but in line with long-term fellow  bull Barclays. The cut comes just days after the bank&amp;#8217;s energy equity analyst Arjun Murti  left his forecast for oil prices unchanged but added at the time prices could  fall below $100 a barrel in the event of a global recession.
