The magnitude of the dollars moves and the breaking of key technical levels suggest that a major shift in the outlook towards the dollar is occurring as massive positions are adjusted. Other analysts described the widespread buying of dollars as capitulation. The dollar hit a five-month high of $1.5055 against the euro and climbed 1.3 per cent to $1.9189 against the pound  its strongest since November 2006. Traders said the violence of the move was testimony to the extent to which the market had been surprised by economic weakness outside the US. Mr Trichet was unable to convince the public that the ECB had not been surprised by the eurozones economic downturn, said Ulrich Leuchtmann at Commerzbank. Therefore, the last remaining rate hike expectations were taken off the table. UK economic data has shown increasing weakness this week; officials in Japan warned that the economy was headed for a recession; and the Reserve Bank of Australia said it was planning to start cutting interest rates to head off an impending economic slowdown.
