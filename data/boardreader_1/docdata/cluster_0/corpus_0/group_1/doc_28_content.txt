 Jump in inflation data jars Wall StreetBy Jeremy Lemer in New YorkCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2008Published: August 4 2008 14:15   Last updated: August 4 2008 14:15Wall Street stocks were set for a lower start on Monday, as investors digested new data showing a sharp rise in prices in June that cut into consumers spending power.The core personal consumption expenditures index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is the Federal Reserves preferred gauge of inflation, rose 0.3 per cent, compared to economists expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise.As a result, although headline spending increased 0.6 per cent after a 0.8 per cent gain in May, after adjusting for inflation, real consumer spending was actually down 0.2 per cent following a 0.3 per cent gain in May.Economists forecast spending would rise 0.4 per cent, following on from a 0.8 per cent increase in May. Those numbers suggest that the impact of the governments tax rebate stimulus plan is beginning to wane along with the amount of rebate payments issued.Personal incomes rose at the slowest rate in over a year, increasing by a paltry 0.1 per cent after a 1.8 per cent jump in the prior month. Analysts forecast a decline of 0.2 per cent.The data on personal consumption expenditures is of particular significance to the market as it measures spending for all goods and services, which makes up about 70 per cent of GDP.A decline in the price of oil could go some way towards offsetting the impact of the data on consumer-facing stocks.Meanwhile, the banking sector was set for a lower start after HSBC said it lost $2.9bn in North America in the first half, compared with profit of $2.4bn a year-earlier, and noted that it couldnt predict when the US mortgage market would rebound.Bank of America fell 1.4 per cent to $32.50, Wells Fargo slipped 0.8 per cent to $30.25, while Citigroup lost 0.6 per cent to $18.74.Separately, the Commerce Department may say that factory orders rose 0.7 per cent in June in a report due at 10 am. That number compares with a 0.6 per cent rise in May.Markets may also take some direction from the second quarter results of Humana, the health insurer that is the biggest company to report on Monday. Humana reported a 3.2 per cent fall in profits to $209.9m, but that number beat analysts estimates and the company raised its full year 2008 earnings forecast.Humana shares added 7.5 per cent to $48 in pre-market trading.Less than an hour before the opening bell, S&amp;P 500 futures were down 4.2 points at 1,256.1 while Nasdaq futures were down 8 points at 1,825.Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 22 points at 11,284.Last week, markets had little to show for a volatile period of trading in which losses at the start and end of the week cancelled out gains in the middle. Equity markets took their cue from mixed second-quarter earnings, a decline in the price of oil and some weak economic data on growth, home prices and employment.More than 85 per cent of companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index have reported second quarter earnings so far and profits have dropped about 20 per cent on average with 66 per cent of companies beating expectations, 11 per cent hitting them, and 23 per cent undershooting.The aggregate results were dragged down by a massive $15.5bn loss at General Motors in particular.Earnings fell by 86 per cent on average in the financial sector and by 56 per cent the consumer discretionary sector, while profits at energy and technology companies grew 18 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, according to data from Thomson Reuters.Financial markets have taken baby steps to normalization across the month of July. With bank earnings, payrolls and the GSE/housing bill out of the way, that trend should continue, said analysts at Barclays Capital.European stocks were lower ahead of the open on Wall Street, after weakness from the banking sector offset a commodity-led bounce for oil companies. By midday in London, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 0.5 per cent at 1,157.93.Asian equity markets closed mainly lower, as investors reacted to Wall Streets 0.5 per cent fall on Friday, US unemployments climb to a four-year high and General Motors announcement of one of its biggest-ever quarterly losses.The Nikkei 225 average ended 1.2 per cent lower at 12,933.18 and the broader Topix index closed down 1.9 per cent at 1,248.25.Gold was trading $4.9 lower at $912.60 per troy ounce.Oil prices were also lower early in New York. US crude prices were down $0.96 at $124.40 a barrel.
