Wall Street stocks rose for the first time in three sessions yesterday as a rally in the banking sector and a decline in oil prices offset concerns about rising inflation and persistently high levels of jobless claims, says the FT. The Financial sector, which had lagged in the last two sessions, topped the list of gainers with a 2.6% advance as investors bought back into some of the most heavily sold stocks of recent days.  Short positions have been covered in Lehman Brothers (LEH), which gained 4.1% yesterday. In late July the percentage of LEH's Market Cap out on loan to short investors (%MCOL) was 32% - this figure has now dropped down to 14% as of c.o.b Wednesday night, presumably in anticipation of the rise in price. There are 14 Days to Cover.    Bank of America (BAC) climbed 4.6% to $30.18, and like LEH, investors have closed out positions and taken profits in the bank. The short interest in BAC has not reached the extremes of LEH and Wachovia (WB), but all the same, the %MCOL has dropped from 4% in late July to 2.5% today.    PMI group, the mortgage insurer, was another gainer, soaring 49.5% to $4.17 after agreeing to sells its Australian operations for $920m, but the shares are still down more than 80% over the past year. As you can see from this graph, short positions have also been covered in this stock and the %MCOL has decreased from 23% in early July to 17% today.    Interestingly, short positions are still being held in Wachovia, despite its 6.9% gain to $15.83 yesterday. The bank's %MCOL has risen steadily over the past six months, reaching an all-time high earlier this week of 18.5%. Utilisation is at 60% so it will now be relatively hard to borrow this stock. The average Utilisation for the rest of the North America Banks sector is 30%, and for the rest of the S&amp;amp;P 500 it is 8.13%. There are 30.4 Days to Cover in this stock.
