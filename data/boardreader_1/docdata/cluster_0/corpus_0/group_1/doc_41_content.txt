US prices jumped in July by their highest month-to-month rate since 1981, in one of the sharpest inflation spikes since the Second World War. The July Producer Prices index, reported Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, rose by 1.2 percent, on top of a 1.8 percent increase in June. "Core" prices, which exclude food and energy, shot up by .7 percent, more than triple economists' expectations. Producer prices were up 9.8 percent from a year ago. "There is no doubt we're in a period of stagflation," Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Bank of America, told Bloomberg News, referring to the combination of stagnant growth and inflation, which characterized the US economy in the 1970s. - Andre Damon
