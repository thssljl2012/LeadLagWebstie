ECB slammed as Europe crumblesBy Ambrose  Evans-Pritchard                     Go To OriginalThe economies of Germany, France and Italy all contracted in the  first quarter and may now be in full recession, shattering assumptions that  Europe would prove able to shrug off the effects of the credit crunch.The picture is darkening so fast in Spain that Prime Minister  Jose Luis Zapatero cancelled holidays and called his cabinet back to Madrid  yesterday for the first emergency session of its kind since the Franco  dictatorship. The crisis meeting agreed to a 20bn (16bn) blitz on public  works, tax cuts, and a mortgage rescue to halt the downward spiral. Growth has turned negative in Ireland, Denmark, Latvia, and  Estonia, while grinding to a halt in Sweden and The Netherlands. Iceland  contracted by a staggering 3.7pc. The grim data from Eurostat follows a  recession warning in Britain, and shock news that the Japanese economy had  shrunk 0.6pc in the second quarter. Almost the entire bloc of rich Organisation for Economic  Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries - still two thirds of the world  economy - are now in the grip of a major downturn. The oil shock over the early  summer appears to have had a dramatic effect on the heavy industries of Japan  and Germany. The eurozone as a whole shrank by 0.2pc, the first contraction  since the launch of the single currency a decade ago. Germany led the slide with  a fall of 0.5pc. France and Italy fell 0.3pc. The delayed effects of the strong  euro, tight credit, and slowing exports have now kicked in with a vengeance."This is an alarm warning for the economy," said the  Confederation of German Industry (BDI).  The European Central Bank and its president Jean-Claude Trichet  appear to have misjudged the severity of the downturn, and may have made a  serious error by raising interest rates a quarter point to 4.25pc last month.   By then it was already clear that property markets were slumping  across much of the region. "What is shocking is the speed of the collapse in  Germany," said Albert Edwards, global strategist at Socit Gnrale. "I think  there has been a lot of hubris at the ECB. They took a derisory attitude towards  the US, saying the Federal Reserve was too aggressive in cutting rates. Now they  are reaping the bitter reward of their policy," he said.  The ultra-hawkish Bundesbank's Axel Weber gave no hint yesterday  that the ECB is softening, suggesting that the bank sees a deliberate crunch as  the only means to pre-empt a 1970s-style wage-price spiral. "The confidence  expressed by some observers that weaker economic growth will lead to a damping  of inflation pressures is in my opinion premature," he said.  This is a highly controversial point. Although fuel and food  prices have pushed headline inflation to a post-EMU high of 4.1pc, core  inflation has fallen from 1.9pc to 1.8pc over the last year. Real wages have  suffered a brutal squeeze. Julian Callow, Europe economist at Barclays Capital,  said the ECB erred by pre-announcing a rate rise in June.  "They boxed themselves in, and it became hard to retreat. It is  clear from the August Bulletin that they have now really woken up to the  downturn," he said. "Recessions in Europe are very nasty events: they tend to be  a lot deeper and more protracted than in the US, which is better able to cope  with the ups and downs of the business cycle," he said.  Mr Callow said the EU's budget deficit limit of 3pc of GDP makes  it impossible for many countries to cushion the hard-landing with a spending  boost. France and Italy are already near the ceiling. Indeed, Italy is having to  tighten policy into the downturn.  Bernard Connolly, global strategist at Banque AIG, said the  eurozone faces possible disintegration unless there is a fiscal bail-out from  Germany that matches  in sheer scale  Berlin's Versailles reparations payments  after the First World War. "The bursting of the EMU credit bubble seems  imminent, and will reveal current account imbalances among euro area countries  as extremely dangerous. The medium-term feasibility of the euro area in its  current form must be open to very considerable doubt," he said.  Spain needs a devaluation of 30pc and Greece needs 40pc to  restore balance to their economies after suffering a major loss of unit labour  competitiveness. The current account deficit is 10pc of GDP in Spain, and 14pc  in Greece.  Mr Connolly said the combination of collapsing demand in southern  Europe and a slide in the external value of the euro now means that the EMU bloc  may now start to export the effects of its troubles to the rest of the world,  making it harder to bring the credit crisis to an end.  Eurostat said Spain managed to eke out growth of 0.1pc in the  second quarter but this is a lagging indicator. The switch from boom to bust is  now turning violent. There are mounting fears that the country could tip into a  severe crisis over the next year.  "A momentous economic slowdown is now under way. We believe the  deterioration in Spain is just in the beginning stages," said a report by Morgan  Stanley. It said there was a serious risk of a blow-up comparable to the ERM  crisis in the early 1990s. This time there is no easy exit. Spain cannot devalue  within EMU, or resort to emergency monetary stimulus.  The Bank of Spain revealed yesterday that Spanish lenders have  now borrowed 49.4bn from the ECB, confirming reports that smaller banks with  heavy exposure to the property market are now relying on EU taxpayer funding to  survive. It is unclear whether long-term support of this kind is strictly legal  under EU rules.  Some banks appear to be issuing fresh bonds for the sole purpose  of obtaining money from the lending window in Frankfurt. Spain's finance  minister Pedro Solbes says it was clearly "unsustainable" for the country to  build 800,000 homes last year in the final crescendo of the boom, but said there  was nothing the government could do to stop it.  "The economic situation is worse than we all predicted. We  thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast," he said.  Construction reached 18pc of GDP in 2007, much of it funded from foreign capital  sources that have now dried up. The sector is in freefall. Unemployment has  jumped by 457,000 over the last year. Industrial output plunged 9pc in June.
