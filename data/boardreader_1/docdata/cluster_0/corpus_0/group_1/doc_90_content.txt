             By JAMES WEIR - The Dominion PostUnemployment is heading toward 5 per cent, with some economists expecting 45,000 jobs to be lost in the next 18 months. The jobless rate is expected to hit an 18-month high of 3.8 per cent in official figures due this week, with economists expecting worse to follow. Westpac Bank economists say the job market is "standing on the precipice" of the first downturn in a decade, which will be a shock to Kiwis who have become used to unemployment being under 4 per cent. Unemployment was 3.6 per cent in the March quarter. Westpac expected unemployment to reach 4.9 per cent by the end of next year. People would lose jobs in real estate, house building, retailing, finance and the meat industry. But there would be more work in agriculture, commercial building and mining.
