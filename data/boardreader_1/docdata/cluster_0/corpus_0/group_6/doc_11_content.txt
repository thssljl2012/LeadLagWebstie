  Geithner is testifying on the Hill this morning.    Andrew Torgan CNN Financial News Producer General Motors has surrendered its crown as the worlds No. 1 automaker. GM reported that global sales plunged 10.8% in 2008 to 8.36 million vehicles. That allowed Japans Toyota to move ahead of GM with sales of 8.97 million vehicles worldwide. It was the first time in nearly 80 years that GM did not sell the most cars in the world. Worse still, a GM executive is warning the company will run out of cash before the end of March if it doesn&#8217;t get the second installment of government bailout money soon. GM is supposed to get the next $5 billion dollars within days. General Motors and Chrysler have four weeks to win deep concessions from unions and creditors to prove they are viable, or they risk losing the $17.4 billion in government loans that are keeping them out of bankruptcy. But there are serious questions as to how great that risk is &#8212; and what exactly GM and Chrysler have to show the government.  The struggles of Detroits automakers continue to spread to their suppliers.

Stocks are bouncing back today as a positive earnings surprise from IBM helps offset growing concerns about the banking sector and job cuts. The Dow fell more than 330 points Tuesday &#8212; the worst Inauguration Day selloff in history &#8212; while the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 each tumbled more than 5%. Banking shares were particularly hard hit, with Dow components Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan all plunging 20% or more on Tuesday. The Senate Finance Committee is holding a confirmation hearing today for Treasury Secretary Nominee Timothy Geithner. The hearing was tentatively set for last week, but it was pushed back after it came to light that Geithner &#8212; who as Treasury Secretary would oversee the IRS &#8212; had failed to pay some $34,023 in self-employment taxes between 2001 and 2004. In prepared remarks, Geithner called for bold action to blunt the economic downturn and promised to tighten the terms for companies getting federal financial help.
