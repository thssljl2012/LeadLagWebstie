The ASX 200 closed just over 3300 points last night, the lowest close in about 4 or 5 years.Commonwealth Bank, which was at $65 per share 14 months ago, is now at $24 or so.Which is more or less where it was about 6 years ago, when I first bought into it.Had some money burning a hole in my bank account, so when I saw the market slump downward yesterday, decided to buy myself another 100 shares in each of Comm Bank and BHP. That sort of retail therapy makes me feel a little more cheerful about the awful direction the sharemarket has been heading. And in case we have a bounce, my share portfolio is now a little better placed to benefit from the bounce.But somehow, I have doubts that we will have the bounce just yet.  I think things are probably going to get much, much, much worse.
