I'm home thanks to the 8+ inches of global warming that fell over night, but it's the equity markets that are getting snowed under  Global stocks have fallen sharply on fears the global financial sector could take a further turn for the worse.  In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 fell by 4.2%, while Germany's Dax was down 2.8% and France's Cac 40 lost 3.6%.  Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei index closed down 3.8% at 7,280.15, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 3.9%.  Confidence was hit by a fresh $30bn bail-out of US insurance giant AIG, and news that UK bank HSBC aimed to raise 12.5bn from its shareholders.  I thought this AIG news was in the market last week? No matter; everything is taken as bad news right now. Consumers...aren't, so the vicious death spiral has begun: people are spending less because they're over-extended and concerned about their jobs, which means companies make less money so they have to fire people. A nasty feedback loop is set up, and it will only get worse for a while, I fear.
