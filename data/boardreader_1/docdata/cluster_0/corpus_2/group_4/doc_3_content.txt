That    reduction kicked off a round of coordinated rate cuts by major    central banks to help ease the impact from the credit crisis.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie eased to $0.6737    from $0.6816 late on Monday. It lost 15 percent last month as    investors dumped currencies of commodity producing countries on    expectations that a global recession would hurt demand for    natural resources.    * The Aussie also dipped to 66.54 yen, from 67.67    yen late here on Monday, after gloomy economic data from the    United States sapped risk appetite and investors moved to the    relative safety of lower-yielding currencies and government    bonds.    * Australian bill futures extended gains, as    investors priced in more rate cuts by the RBA before Christmas.    * Australian bond futures were firmer as safe-haven inflows    re-emerged. Three-year bond futures rose 0.045 points to 95.465,    while the 10-year futures contract added 0.020 points to 94.62.
