NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rallied against the euro on Thursday, buoyed by demand from U.S. corporations and global fund managers seeking to square their books or rebalance their portfolios by month-end.    The yen, on the other hand, retreated against most major currencies after the Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s interest rate cut on Wednesday eased risk aversion, boosting equities worldwide.    &amp;#039;People are looking at the month-end tomorrow and the market is expecting massive demand for dollars,&amp;#039; said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at WestPac Banking Corp. in New York.    &amp;#039;So there&amp;#039;s a lot of fund managers all over the world that&amp;#039;s going to buy U.S. dollars. There&amp;#039;s probably a lot of nervousness about that.&amp;#039;    Fund managers worldwide are expected to buy substantial amounts of dollars as the month-end approaches to neutralize hedges because of the reduction in their portfolios.    In midday New York trading, the euro was down 0.8 at $1.2855 in volatile trade, pulling away from intra-session highs at $1.3300, but well above a 2-1/2-year low of $1.2329 hit this week on electronic trading platform EBS.    The ICE Futures dollar index, which measures the dollar&amp;#039;s value against six other major currencies, was up 0.5 percent at 85.051.    Data released earlier showing a smaller-than-expected contraction in the U.S. economy in the third quarter underpinned sentiment on risky assets, including higher-yielding currencies.    Still, the fall in U.S. gross domestic product in the last quarter was the sharpest contraction in seven years.    Analysts were also mostly skeptical about the market&amp;#039;s renewed optimism, noting that a recovery in stocks and higher-yielders such as the Australian dollar may not last beyond two days.    &amp;#039;Look at what happened when the Treasury and Europe announced their bailout plans, the rebound lasted just one to two days,&amp;#039; Franulovich said. &amp;#039;I don&amp;#039;t see this current market recovery being anything different and you can see that gains are coming off a bit.&amp;#039;    DOLLAR DEMAND TO STAY FOR NOW    The dollar climbed 0.3 percent against the yen to 97.710 yen, extending its recovery from a 13-year trough just below 91 yen touched on EBS late last week.    Sterling fell 0.8 percent against the dollar to $1.62933, after trading higher earlier. The Australian and New Zealand dollars, on the other hand, rose roughly 0.7 percent and 0.2 percent respectively.    U.S. stocks were up at midday, but were off their highs for the day. Earlier, Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei stocks average surged nearly 10 percent.    Higher share prices showed that the extreme risk aversion following the meltdown in the banking sector that had triggered waves of selling in past weeks had abated.    The rebound in stocks and high-yielders came after the Federal Reseve reduced borrowing costs by a half percentage point to 1 percent on Wednesday and left the door open for further easing of monetary policy.    The Fed also approved on Wednesday currency swap lines with central banks in several major emerging countries, making dollars available to help them deal with the credit crunch.    Overall, despite a slew of measures to ease the credit crunch and boost risk appetite, markets are still quite fragile while the economic benefits are limited, analysts say. Market participants believe demand for U.S. dollars would remain intact.    &amp;#039;Dollar-weakness (in recent sessions) has been more about dollar longs being unwound as opposed to an active interest to short the dollar,&amp;#039; said Divyang Shah, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.    &amp;#039;The bias remains for volatility to remain in play and more importantly the demand for dollars to remain.&amp;#039;    (Editing by Leslie Adler) Keywords: MARKETS FOREX    tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomsonreuters.com    cmr    COPYRIGHT    Copyright Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
