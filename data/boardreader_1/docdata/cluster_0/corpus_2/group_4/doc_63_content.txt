 Banks are looking very attractive.  PE ratios down to 4 make them absoloute bargains.  I particularly like Barclays, they arent going to have to suffer government interference as they havent been bailed out.  BP, Shell are also rock solid, and very cheap.  There are some good mining stock around too,  Vedanta, BHP Biliton, Anglo American amongst others that are very cheap right now.  Pharmas too are cheap, and a solid investement.  Astra, Glaxo and so on.  (Of course all this is assuming you trade on the Londoin market  )   If you take a long term view, 2 to 3 years or so, you can do very well on stocks.
