FEARS over the global economic slowdown drove oil prices down to as low as US$55 a barrel yesterday - almost US$100 less than its price just four months ago.    The relentless decline in prices - they are now at their lowest in 22 months - comes despite Opec slashing output. The oil cartel said yesterday that production will be curtailed again, this time by as early as the end of the month.       But while crude&amp;#039;s price fall means trouble for producers, it spells relief for Singapore consumers as it soothes the sting from inflation.       Transport costs, including pump prices, and electricity bills should all come down in coming months.       Economists expect electricity tariffs, which went up 21 per cent last month, to ease in January, given the continued slide in oil prices.       And Shell, SPC and Caltex cut pump prices last Friday - the 13th time since crude oil peaked in July.       Consumers can also expect to see lower prices for many end-products that use crude oil as a raw material.       These include plastics and rubber used in a vast array of consumer and industrial products, although the effects will take some time to filter through.       But there is a double edge to this price-cutting sword.       &amp;#039;Falling oil prices may be good news to consumers, but if read deeper, it may not be all that good for the economy,&amp;#039; as it is a reflection of a severe global slowdown, said CIMB-GK economist Song Seng Wun. The sharp fall in oil prices reflects the underlying state of demand, which may drop even further, despite low crude prices, he added.       OCBC economist Selena Ling agreed: &amp;#039;Now&amp;#039;s not a question of inflation per se but global demand and the economy slowing, and global demand has dropped off the cliff.       &amp;#039;The biggest challenge is...other issues like demand, sales growth and obtaining financing.&amp;#039;       The volatile crude price caused oil trading in Singapore - the world&amp;#039;s third biggest energy trading hub - to fall 44 per cent in September from a year ago, according to price assessment agency Platts.       The price of oil recovered last night to US$57 a barrel, but some analysts believe oil prices could fall below US$50 a barrel in the near term.       Still, they say such levels will not be sustainable in the long run.       Prices may have fallen a bit too much as concerns have been focused on weakening demand while not considering that oil is facing a supply shortage in the longer run, they say.       &amp;#039;Oil prices will recover. The question is the pace of that recovery,&amp;#039; said Barclays Capital&amp;#039;s head of research and managing director, Mr Larry Kantor, who was in Singapore yesterday.       UBS head of commodity research, Mr Dominic Schnider, said Asia&amp;#039;s growth numbers &amp;#039;will look even worse&amp;#039; than the past two quarters. He expects crude to average at US$80 a barrel for 2009.       Both expect demand to stay flat next year due to lower economic activity.       And just to underline their pessimism: The International Energy Agency slashed its 2009 oil price forecast to US$80 a barrel, down from US$110 yesterday, saying an imminent recession is strangling demand in rich countries and crimping emerging economies.
