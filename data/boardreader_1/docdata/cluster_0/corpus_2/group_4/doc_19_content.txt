SYDNEY, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Australian iron ore miner Fortescue Metals has secured an increase in supply to China, the firm said on Thursday, in a trading update that stood in stark contrast to gloom surrounding the rest of the industry.    Fortescue said in the update it had also seized on an opportunity to buy back some of its own bonds at a steep discount to their face value, after the paper fell in the secondary market.    Australia&amp;#039;s third-largest iron ore producer, behind Rio Tinto  and BHP Billiton, said it had renegotiated a contract with one Chinese steel mill to sell an additional 3.5 million more tonnes of ore in 2009.    It also reported a &amp;#039;trading profit&amp;#039; of A$360 million ($232 million), based on sales of 6.8 million tonnes of ore, for the three months to end-September, but did not give a comparison.

A spokesman for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said it had acted to provide liquidity, as it has done on several recent occasions when the market became disorderly.    The Australian dollar had slid almost three U.S. cents to a one-month low of $0.6075 before the RBA stepped in, but its action only managed to lift the currency slightly to $0.6090.
