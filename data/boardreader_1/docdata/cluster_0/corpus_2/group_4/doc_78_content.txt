It saw    growth picking up to 2.5 percent in 2010, but down from 2.75    percent previously.    * It saw core inflation slowing to 3.5 percent by the end of    next year and 3 percent by the end of 2010. Inflation would only    return to within its 2-3 percent target band in 2011, instead of    2010 as previously anticipated.    ___________________________________  ____________________________    * The Australian dollar stretched gains past 69 U.S. cents    on Monday, lifted by better risk appetite and higher metal    prices. Commodities gained in Asian trade, with copper jumping    almost 7 percent, helped by a huge Chinese stimulus package.    * China&amp;#039;s official Xinhua news agency said the world&amp;#039;s    fourth-largest economy approved nearly $600 billion in new    government spending, seen by many as a move to stave off the    threat of a sharp slowdown in the global economy. China is a big    importer of Australian&amp;#039;s commodity exports.    * Asian stocks were higher, buoyed by Wall Street gains and    hopes that global-wide fiscal and monetary policy stimulus would    help prevent a sharp downturn in economic activity.    * The RBA lowered its growth forecasts over the next two    years as the credit crunch takes its toll on the economy. The    central bank also said it would review interest rates in the    months ahead with the aim to prevent a sharper downturn.    * The central bank cut its cash rate by a larger than    expected 75 basis points to 5.25 percent last week, after a 100    basis point cut in October. Markets are pricing in a further 75    basis point reduction in December.    * Gains by Asian stocks underpinned demand for carry trades,    helping lift the Aussie to 68.34 yen from 65.34 yen    late here on Friday.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie was at $0.6893    against the U.S. dollar, up from $0.6708 late here on Friday and    not far from a recent peak of $0.7015 struck on Nov. 4.    * The U.S. currency weakened broadly after data on Friday    showed the U.S. economy shed more jobs than expected in October,    providing further evidence of a deep downturn. .    * Australian bond futures were lower as safe-haven inflows    took a breather. Three-year bond futures fell 0.08 points to    95.77, while the 10-year futures contract shed    0.035 points to 94.775.
