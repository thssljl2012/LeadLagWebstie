Market Update 081031    http://biz.yahoo.com/mu/update.html    4:35 pm : Stocks started the session in negative territory before  making their way higher to tout gains in excess of 3%. Although  another late selling effort pared gains, the stock market still  finished higher. Friday&amp;#039;s advance put an end to the month-long  streak of failing to register back-to-back gains.      Earnings announcements were relatively light ahead of the opening  bell, causing market participants to turn to other corporate  announcements and economic data.      Integrated oil giant Chevron (CVX 74.60, +0.42) traded in choppy  fashion after posting better-than-expected third quarter results.  Its net income more than doubled, thanks largely to record high oil  prices.      Oil prices were down more than 4% at their session low, but made a  rallied late in the day to close roughly 3% higher near $68 per  barrel. Despite the rally in crude prices, energy remained a  laggard. It ended the session just 0.6% higher, up 13.3% for the  week.      Tech (+0.1%) was also a notable laggard. Semiconductors fell 0.4%  after Intel (INTC 16.03, -0.14) indicated current financial  conditions could have a negative impact on operations.      Internet search companies Yahoo! (YHOO 12.82, -0.11) and Google  (GOOG 359.36, -0.33) posted mixed results after reports suggested a  business deal between the pair is looking unlikely due to  regulators&amp;#039; requirements.      Financials emerged to provide leadership after lagging in the prior  session. The sector closed 5.5% higher, more than any other sector,  as every one of its industry groups advanced. Financials finished  the week 11.6% higher.      Failing to participate in the gains, though, was Barclays (BCS  10.73, -2.88). Shares of the British bank sunk after it received  nearly $12 billion in capital from a group of Middle East  investors, according to reports.      Separately, Fed Chairman Bernanke stated in a prepared speech that  the idea of privatizing GSEs and letting them compete as private  mortgage insurers and securitizers has been discussed. He also  stated that at least under the most stressed conditions, some form  of government backstop may be necessary to ensure continued  securitization of mortgages.      Many pundits continue pointing to the need to shore up the housing  industry and, in turn, mortgage exposure on banks&amp;#039; balance sheets  before the economy can get back on track.      Still, central banks continue using traditional tools to stimulate  growth. Most recently, Japan&amp;#039;s central bank announced a key  overnight lending rate target cut to 0.3% from 0.5%.      In other economic data, the core PCE deflator was up 0.2%. Total  PCE deflator was up 0.1%, as energy prices dipped. The third  quarter employment cost index provided good news from an inflation  standpoint, and with a softer labor market, there is reason to  expect the favorable trend to persist.      September personal income and spending numbers were down 0.3%,  reaffirming what was indicated in the advance third quarter GDP  release.      For the week, investors pushed stocks more than 10% higher, whcih  marks the best single-week advance in recent years. However, the  stock market finished the month almost 17% lower, marking one of  the worst monthly performances in decades.DJ30 +144.32 NASDAQ  +22.43 SP500 +14.66 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 2147/2.48 bln/653 NYSE  Adv/Vol/Dec 2268/1.57 bln/835      3:30 pm : Stocks have encountered a bout of stiff selling pressure  as traders head into the session&amp;#039;s final stretch. Each of the major  indices moved sharply off their session highs.      Whether the session&amp;#039;s gains completely roll over will only be seen  in time. However, if gains are maintained, it will mark the first  time the stock market registered advances for two consecutive  sessions in over one month.      At its current level, the stock market is positioned to conclude  the week more than 10% higher. For the month, though, the stock  market is positioned to end more than 17% lower.DJ30 +93.18 NASDAQ  +11.21 SP500 +10.07 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1940/1.90 bln/803 NYSE  Adv/Vol/Dec 2181/907 mln/894      3:05 pm : Stocks trade in a relatively tight range near session  highs.      Market breadth is positive. Advancers outpace decliners by 19-to-6  on the NYSE and by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume, however, is on the  light side with only 783 million shares exchanging hands on the  NYSE.DJ30 +235.43 NASDAQ +39.65 SP500 +26.82 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec  2032/1.63 bln/702 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2329/783 mln/735      2:30 pm : Crude oil prices are spiking higher, though no news item  seems immediately responsible for the climb. After being down as  much as 4.3%, crude is now up more than 3% to above $68 per  barrel.      The stock market has pared some of its gains, but remains well  above its early morning low. Shortly after the opening bell the  S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 had fallen to a 1.0% loss.      Fed Chairman Bernanke stated in a prepared speech that the idea of  privatizing GSEs and letting them compete as private mortgage  insurers and securitizers has been discussed. He also stated that  at least under the most stressed conditions, some form of  government backstop may be necessary to ensure continued  securitization of mortgages.

For a moment  the Dow was up 2.7%, the Nasdaq was up 2.3%, and the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500  was up 2.8%.      Nine of the 10 economic sectors are trading with gains. Only the  defensive-oriented utilities sector (-0.1%) has failed to join the  bunch. Utilities have also logged one of the weakest week-to-date  performances, advancing 7.8% since Monday. Only healthcare has  fared worse by that measure, it is up 6.2% since Monday, but up  2.2% in this session alone.DJ30 +185.02 NASDAQ +31.73 SP500 +20.90  NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1994/1.35 bln/684 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2240/647  mln/795      1:30 pm : Broad-based gains have taken the major indices to their  highest levels of the afternoon. At their current levels, the Dow,  Nasdaq, and S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 are each looking to conclude the week with  gains exceeding 11%.      The Dow is currently on pace for its best weekly advance in  years.      As equities improve, Treasuries have been paring gains. The  benchmark 10-year Note is currently up just 3 ticks after being up  as many as 32 ticks.DJ30 +174.74 NASDAQ +30.61 SP500 +20.54 NASDAQ  Adv/Vol/Dec 1920/1.22 bln/722 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2194/580 mln/823      1:00 pm : Stocks retrace their recent downturn to add to their  gains. Financials (+3.2%) continue to show leadership and challenge  their session high.      Commodities are being hit with selling pressure, causing the energy  sector (-0.6%) and the materials sector (-0.6%) to underperform.  Much of the weakness in commodities is owed the confluence of  recession-based fears and a rebound in the U.S. dollar.DJ30 +89.44  NASDAQ +14.57 SP500 +10.04 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1791/1.09 bln/807  NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1977/512 mln/1019      12:30 pm : The major indices are moving downward after posting  solid gains. Large-cap tech stocks are showing particular weakness  and have caused the Nasdaq 100 (-0.2%) to fall back into the  red.      Apple (AAPL 107.72, -3.32) is a notable laggard as its shares are  hit by profit takers. The stock is down roughly 3% this session,  but up 14% for the week.      Small-cap stocks are faring well as the major indices seek  direction. The Russell 2000 is up 2.6% currently. It also  outperformed the headline indices in the prior session. DJ30 +66.10  NASDAQ +9.77 SP500 +6.83 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1776/988 mln/793 NYSE  Adv/Vol/Dec 1962/465 mln/1006      12:05 pm : Stocks are trading with healthy gains after opening the  session in negative territory. Only defensive-oriented sectors  exhibited resilience early on, but now seven of the 10 economic  sectors are showing gains.      Should the stock market end the session higher, it would be the  first back-to-back advance in over one month. Currently, the  S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 is poised to conclude the week 10.0% higher, though it  is facing a loss of 17% for October.      Market participants received another dose of economic data this  morning. The core PCE deflator was up 0.2%. Total PCE deflator was  up 0.1%, as energy prices dipped. The numbers are likely to be  lower in upcoming months. Additionally, the third quarter  employment cost index provided good news from an inflation  standpoint. With a softer labor market, there is reason to expect  the favorable trend to persist in the fourth quarter.      September personal income and spending numbers were down 0.3%,  which was not surprising after yesterday&amp;#039;s advance third quarter  GDP release. Despite indications of softer consumer spending,  retailers are outperforming the broader market. They are currently  up 2.7% this session. Retailers are likely to benefit from lower  oil prices as fewer dollars at the fuel pump means more money for  discretionary purchases.      A stronger dollar is helping put pressure on oil prices. The  greenback is up an impressive 1.7% this session, when measured  against a basket of foreign currencies. The U.S. dollar is up 12.1%  year-to-date.      The dollar&amp;#039;s recent strength is owed to international investors  seeking safety from economic turmoil. Such turmoil has prompted  central banks across the globe to cut interest rates. Most  recently, Japan&amp;#039;s central bank announced a key overnight lending  rate target cut to 0.3% from 0.5%.      Crude prices are down 2.5% midsession. The commodity most recently  traded hands for little more than $64 per barrel.      Crude oil prices hit an all-time high of $147 per barrel in the  third quarter, helping Chevron (CVX 73.85, -0.33) more than double  its net income. The company posted better-than-expected third  quarter results.      Elsewhere in corporate news, a se...
