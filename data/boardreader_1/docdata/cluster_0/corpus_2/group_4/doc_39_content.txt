US gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent for the third quarter, the sharpest fall in the world&amp;#039;s largest oil consumer in seven years, knocking commodities lower across the board on fears of weakening fundamentals. A rebounding US dollar also weighed.         US light crude for December delivery fell US$1.81 to US$64.15 a barrel by 0711 GMT (3.11pm Singapore time), adding to Thursday&amp;#039;s US$1.54 loss that cut short a brief rally earlier in the week.         Oil is now on track for a more than 35 per cent loss this month, its biggest ever.   London Brent crude was down US$1.97 to US$61.74, having fallen by US$2.02 to US$61.69 minutes earlier.         &amp;#039;Concerns that the weak international economic outlook will depress oil consumption remain a negative for the oil price&amp;#039;, Mr David Moore, commodity strategist for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a daily note.         Adding pressure on oil, the US dollar rebounded from lows fetched on Wednesday, making US dollar-denominated commodities less attractive for investors.         Recent data showed demand was hit by high prices even before the crisis intensified, with revised US oil consumption in August tumbling 8.4 per cent from a year ago to 19.267 million bpd, with demand at its lowest for any month since December 2001, Energy Information Administration data showed.         Oil has more than halved since its record high of US$147.27 from July as the economic crisis batters demand in the United States and other major consumers, and saps investor appetite for riskier assets including stocks and commodities.         Signs that Opec is acting on its decision to cut output by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) have failed to lift prices.         Nigeria announced a 5 per cent cut in exports in November and December after Abu Dhabi made similar moves. Top exporter Saudi Arabia has yet to inform customers of fresh curbs.         Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said on Thursday that Opec should cut oil output by another 1 million barrels per day - possibly before its next scheduled meeting in December - and should set a minimum price target of US$70 or US$80 a barrel.         On Thursday, oil and other commodities decoupled from the stock markets, which rallied around the world on optimism that interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks will ease a looming global recession.       Asian shares dipped on Friday and headed for their biggest ever monthly fall, but optimism that a new round of interest rate cuts may revive a comatose global economy helped many indexes keep their largest weekly gains on record. --            THOMSON REUTERS         http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking...1.html?vgnmr=1
