 Allison Jackson   November 10, 2008    Article from:  The Australian        INVESTORS brushed aside the Reserve Bank&amp;#039;s bleak outlook today and cheered China&amp;#039;s $862 billion stimulus package, sending stocks up.         Equity markets around the region rose strongly, with Australian  shares rallying more than 2 per cent and the Australian dollar marching towards US70c, after China announced plans to invest 4 trillion yuan ($862 billion) in infrastructure and social welfare projects over the next two years.       A strong rebound in US and European markets on Friday night also lifted sentiment.       The package is equivalent to about 86 per cent of Australias annual gross domestic product and follows similar moves in the US and Europe to stimulate economic activity and prevent a deep and lengthy recession. Australia is spending $10.4 billion on its stimulus plan.       Investors hope the stimulus package will shield China, one of Australias biggest trading partners, from the full impact of the global economic downturn and revive demand for resources.       Citi Smith Barney adviser Fabiola Gibson said: It reflects how serious the government is about shoring up Chinese GDP growth.       They have got very large foreign exchange reserves to spend on infrastructure and a lot of that will potentially be spent on steel. Whether they are building bridges or roads, its a positive for resources.       The benchmark S&amp;amp;amp;P/ASX 200 rose 100.4 points, or 2.48 per cent to 4151.7 this afternoon as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto rallied on hopes Chinas appetite for iron ore, copper and other commodities will increase as a result of the stimulus.       The All Ordinaries was up 95.9 points at 4102.5.       The commodity-driven Australian dollar was trading at US68.91c after touching US69.29c earlier in the session as investors risk appetite returned and regional shares responded positively to the massive injection of capital into Chinas economy. The Aussie dollar closed at US67.01c on Friday.       Japans Nikkei 225 Index was higher by 5.49 per cent, Hong Kongs Hang Seng was up 5.33 per cent and Chinas Shanghai Composite up more than 6 per cent.       Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Richard Grace said the stimulus package would ensure China remained in the drivers seat of economic growth, which would help its trading partners.       China trades with a lot of countries, so if it has an increase in demand for imports that is going to help a number of countries, said Mr Grace.       The news overshadowed the RBAs worse-than-expected outlook for Australian economic growth.       The RBA believes annualised growth in Australia will be 1.5 per cent in December, down from its 2 per cent forecast that was forecast in August.       The projections, contained in the RBAs Statement of Monetary Policy, are below the 1.8 per cent growth pace that was published last week by the IMF and the 2 per cent growth forecast by the Treasury Department last week.       However, traders said investors had expected the RBA to downgrade its forecasts and the cuts were not deep enough to spook the market.       The RBA also believes inflation will begin to ease more rapidly than expected, as the result of the economy&amp;#039;s sharp moderation.       The bank had expected inflation would not be at 3 per cent - the top of its target range - until June 2010. However, it now believes that level will be reached a year earlier.       TD Securities strategist Joshua Williamson said the RBAs bearish comments had left open the possibility for more aggressive rate cuts at its meeting in December.       They have become much more concerned about the downside risk of a global downturn on Australian growth, said Mr Williamson.       We are looking for a 50 basis point cut in December, but couldnt rule out a 75 basis point cut based on whats been said today.       The RBA has cut rates by 200 basis points in the past three months, reducing borrowing costs to the lowest level in more than five years.
