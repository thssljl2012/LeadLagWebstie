SYDNEY, Nov 6 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar retreated    further away from recent highs above 70 U.S. cents on Thursday,    as mounting worries about a global economic slowdown kept    investors wary of riskier assets and higher-yielding currencies.    * More weak data from the United States served as a reminder    to investors about the grim outlook for the global economy. U.S.    private employers cut a larger-than-expected 157,000 jobs in    October while the Institute for Supply Management said its    non-manufacturing index fell to 44.4 versus 50.2 in September.    * Stocks and commodities fell. The CRB commodities index  dropped 3.7 percent on Wednesday as investors dumped    resources on concerns about falling demand in a global downturn.    Australia is a major exporter of resources.    * Investors now await local jobs data for October at 11:30    a.m. (0030 GMT). The labour market has been softening in the past    few months and a Reuters poll forecast a fall of 10,000 in    employment in the month, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.4    percent and the participation rate unchanged at 65.1 percent.    * By 9:30 a.m. (2230 GMT), the Aussie was at $0.6779,    down from $0.6888 late here on Wednesday and off a two-week peak    of $0.7015 struck on Nov. 4.    * The Aussie fell to 66.32 yen from 68.55 yen as    investors favoured the relative safety of low-yielding currencies    and government bonds after stocks dived on the gloomy economic    data.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered rates earlier this    week by a bigger-than-expected 75 basis points to support growth    in the economy, and the Bank of England and the European Central    Bank are also expected to slash rates on Thursday.    * Australian bill futures extended gains as investors priced    in chances of more domestic rate reductions by the end of the    year. Bond futures soared, bouyed by safe-haven inflows.    * Three-year bond futures rose 0.105 points to    95.745, while the 10-year futures contract jumped 0.15    points to 94.80.
