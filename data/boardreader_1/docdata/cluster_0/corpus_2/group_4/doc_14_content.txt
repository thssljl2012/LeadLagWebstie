 Offshore Sportsbooks &amp; Online Sports Picks                 Monday morning thoughts from TC              Good morning. Overnight on the major Asian indices stocks are in rally mode, after China unveiled a nearly $600 billion economic stimulus plan, one of many steps countries are taking to limit the economic fallout from the financial crisis. The Hang Seng in China is up 3.52% and the Nikkei in Japan is up 5.81%. The Yen and the $US are down, as a result, commodity prices are up sharply across the board, after China&amp;#039;s announcement and as financial officials from the Group of 20 economic powers, which include major developing countries, ironed out ways to stimulate growth at a weekend meeting. Asian economists are saying, interest rate cuts, bigger government spending globally and a likely recovery in corporate investments next year, should sow the seeds for an economic rebound. The damage inflicted by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression was highlighted by data on Friday showing the U.S. jobless rate hitting a 14-year high and Japanese data today showing machinery orders suffered the biggest quarterly fall in a decade. The All Ordinaries in Australia is the one index bucking the uptrend in the Asia/Pacific markets, as it was down 1.13% today, after the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its economic growth forecasts for the next two years. The China stimulus package has had a stabilizing effect short term as evidenced by the sharp rise in commodity prices today. However, I doubt the rally will last more than a couple of days. At some point investors will wake up and ask themselves, why did China need to take such drastic action? This was an economy that was forecast to have 9% growth this year, something smells quite not right in China. JMHO    In Europe, the major indices are also up sharply this morning, as the economic stimulus package from China has brightened a gloomy demand outlook and is giving a boost to energy and mining stocks. The markets are reacting to lower interest rates and world wide stimulus packages, with inflation no where in sight. Energy stocks are getting a big boost today in England, lifted by firmer oil prices and Saudi Arabia&amp;#039;s pledge to cut supply in December by 5 percent. British factory costs fell by a record 5.6% in October on falling oil prices. The figures are likely to boost expectations that headline inflation could fall from its current 5.2% in the coming months to below the Bank of England&amp;#039;s 2% target. In turn these declining inflation targets could see interest rates in Britain falling to 1.5% in 2009. It has not come as a surprise to see wholesale prices starting to decline. If US interest rates can be justified at 1% then England&amp;#039;s interest rate has some way to fall yet. With the global economies still in a mess, from the made on Wall St financial crisis, I would expect this rally to be short lived and last for a couple of days at best. With so many doom and gloom scenario&amp;#039;s on the horizon, this appears to be just a bear market rally, the weak fundamentals for the worlds economies obviously haven&amp;#039;t changed over the weekend. Once again just my honest opinion.    On this side of the pond in North America there is nothing on the economic calendar for today. The futures are up sharply as I type for the US indices, at least for the open. It appears we are in rally mode for today and probably tomorrow. The reason I say that is because there is nothing on the economic calendar until Thursday, so we should be able to avoid bad news until at least then. However by about Wednesday, investors should be getting edgy, as the Initial Jobless Claims are released on Thursday before the market opens and by all indications they will be ugly. The weaker US dollar is causing a rally in commodity prices overseas, which should bode well for the Canadian indices for today. As I type here this morning the prices of oil, gold and base metals are up sharply, so it should be a good day, for the TSX-v stocks, to join the expected rally in the TSX.    Back in McFaulds Lake it was another blah day for NOT on Friday, with declining volume the stock closed flat at $.78 for the day. With a low for the day at $.77 and a high at $.82 we can see the stock is stuck in a tight trading range as investor interest wanes. For today NOT has support at $.74 and resistance at $.84, with the 13(MA) now at $.87 and falling. There is nothing on NOT&amp;#039;s chart that would give any indications the stock is going to turn around any time soon, however NOT does appear to be oversold. This is a stock badly in need of some good news from the drilling front, or a surprise listing on the TSX announcement. This week should be a tell tale sign for NOT as base metal prices appear to be in rally mode, so we should see some strength in the junior mining sector. If NOT fails to rally with the rest of the base metal stocks, I fear for the share price long term. If NOT is going to turn this long downtrend around it should be this week. JMHO    Looking at the chart for FWR today, the first thing that pops out at me is the inverse head and shoulder pattern that started showing up last week on the chart. I am taking this as an early clue, that FWR&amp;#039;s share price is on the verge of breaking out. The only thing that concerns me is FWR is currently taking a 3 week break from drilling as they do a follow up gravity survey, over the Black Thor chromite zone as well as the F2 nickel-copper occurrence. However, we may get some assay results to give FWR&amp;#039;s share price the expected pop. On the chart for today FWR has support at $.165 and resistance at $.205, with the 13(MA) at $.18, which FWR is currently trading above. This important MA should be solid support, if as expected the share price is on the verge of aspiring for much higher prices. For those trying to time an entry point for a breakout, if by chance it should happen, a buy at $.225 just over the important Fib point on the chart, is where I would buy into this stock. I would rather wait for confirmation of the breakout and miss a couple cents of gains, than be too early and end up sitting on dead money. If FWR does break out, it would meet resistance at the $.275 level another Fib point, but if it breaks atop that level a run to around the $.35 level is certainly possible. At $.35 I would expect the share price to run out of steam because of the previous PP at that level. If the breakout occurred on assay news and it picked up enough volume to break atop the $.35 level, you then could start thinking about new 52 week highs for the stock. There are a lot of &amp;quot;IF&amp;#039;s&amp;quot; in the above scenario, but certainly within the realm of possibilities. One thing I would advise shareholders is to not fall in love, if the above scenario ever did by chance play out and take profits off the table. In the current market environment, I expect any market rally to be short lived. JMHO    FNC is currently trading in a tight range, but the volume pick up on Friday was encouraging, even as it closed down for the day. Last trade of the day on low volume stocks such as FNC are really meaningless as long as the stock remains in it&amp;#039;s trading range. On the chart of FNC there is support at $.265 and resistance at $.345, with $.325 being the 13(MA). The one thing from FNC&amp;#039;s chart that I find encouraging, is if FNC ever releases assay news and the market takes a shine to it, there is one tasty looking gap to be filled on the chart all the way up to the $1.15 level. It would obviously take one hell of a good looking set of assays for the market to ever fill that gap on the chart, but, stranger things have happened. One word of caution with FNC, this stock is a lottery ticket, plain and simple and we all know the odds of ever hitting a winner. JMHO    Over the next couple of trading sessions it appears the market is poised to be in rally mode. If I was a owner of TSX-v stocks which I&amp;#039;m not, (I currently only own APH as my lottery ticket), I would use this opportunity to exit my positions in as many TSX-v stocks as I could possibly get out of. To me this appears to be nothing more than a bear market rally and will most likely get sold as the reality of the economic mess we are currently in, brings investors back to their senses. Please do not take this as a recommendation to buy or sell stocks, it is merely how I would play the situation. I play the markets to try and make money, not to fall in love with stocks and end up being a bagholder, so obviously I have a shorter term time frame to holding stocks, than many investors who read the morning thoughts posts. I am sure many have noticed my posts on the McFaulds Lake stocks are more on the technical side than the fundamental side lately. That is because I am trying to help those that want help, to get out of their current mess, that many have in their portfolio&amp;#039;s. Please don&amp;#039;t use any of my comments as buy and sell advice that is not what I am trying to do here. Buying and selling stocks is an individual choice, the statements I am making are only my thoughts and should be treated as such. So take anything I post with a grain of salt and make your own investment decisions. Do your own DD when making investment decisions, not someone else&amp;#039;s. However real DD uses not only fundamental analysis, it also includes technical analysis. In the current market environment my best advice is to lean on the side of technical analysis much more than the fundamental side. Taking your money out of the TSX-v exchange and buying beaten down stocks trading on the TSX, makes much more sense to me than trying to play the TSX-v exchange stocks in current market conditions. The stocks trading on the TSX for the most part, will bounce back long before the TSX-v stocks. JMHO    Best of luck to all McFaulds Lake investors.        Al
