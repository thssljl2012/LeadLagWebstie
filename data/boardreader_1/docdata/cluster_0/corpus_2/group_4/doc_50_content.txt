Oil falls below $56 as Japan slips into recession Monday November 17, 7:34 am ET By Pablo Gorondi, Associated Press Writer Oil falls below $56 as Japan recession heightens fears of global economic slowdown Oil prices fell below $56 a barrel Monday as news that Japan fell into recession highlighted investor fears that a global economic slowdown will hurt crude demand. By midday in Europe, light, sweet crude for December delivery was down $1.23 to $55.81 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell $1.20 Friday to settle at $57.04. In London, January Brent crude fell $1.17 to $53.07 on the ICE Futures exchange. Japan, the world&amp;#039;s second-largest economy, said Monday it slid into a recession for the first time since 2001 after gross domestic product contracted at an annual pace of 0.4 percent in the third quarter after a shrinking 3.7 percent in the second quarter. Japan now joins the 15-nation euro-zone in a recession, defined as two straight quarters of GDP contraction. &amp;quot;Markets are very worried about the international economic outlook, about oil consumption,&amp;quot; said David Moore, a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. &amp;quot;As data is released in the U.S., Europe and other countries, investors get a reminder of the economic problems in the developed world.&amp;quot; Oil prices have tumbled about 62 percent since peaking at nearly $150 a barrel in mid-July. &amp;quot;With the world&amp;#039;s largest economies slowing down remarkably, oil demand outlook is worsening,&amp;quot; said JBC Energy in Vienna, Austria. Comments Sunday from OPEC President Chakib Khelil, downplaying the possibility that the group could cut production at a meeting this month, also weighed on prices. On Saturday, Iran called on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce output quotas by up to 1.5 million barrels a day a meeting later this month. But Khelil said OPEC, which accounts for about 40 percent of world crude supply, hasn&amp;#039;t yet fully enforced previous quotas and the group needs more data before it decides to cut production. Iran&amp;#039;s call for more cuts is a &amp;quot;wish,&amp;quot; Khelil said. OPEC, which cut quotas by 1.5 million barrels a day last month, plans to meet for an emergency session on Nov. 29 in Cairo, Egypt, and will meet again in Oran, Algeria, on Dec. 17. &amp;quot;The short-term trend for oil prices is possibly still to the downside,&amp;quot; Moore said. &amp;quot;But as the OPEC cuts start to take surplus out of the market, this tightening will eventually give support to the oil price.&amp;quot; Oil prices were down despite a weaker U.S. dollar as investors seemed more affected by falling global stock markets. By midday in Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 1.3 percent, Germany&amp;#039;s DAX was lower by 1.5 percent and the CAC-40 in France was off 1.6 percent. Investors often buy oil futures as a hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar and sell when the dollar gains. The euro rose to $1.2672 Monday from $1.2602 on Friday while the dollar fell against the Japanese yen to 96.38 yen from 97.57 yen on Friday. In other Nymex trading, gasoline futures fell 2.21 cents to $1.217 a gallon. Heating oil dropped 1.78 cents to $1.814 a gallon while natural gas for December delivery rose 5.8 cents to fetch $6.37 per 1,000 cubic feet.
