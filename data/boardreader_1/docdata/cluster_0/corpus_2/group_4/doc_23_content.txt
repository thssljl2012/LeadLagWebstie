SYDNEY, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar slipped on    Tuesday, as a recent revival in appetite for higher-yielding    currencies waned, and could extend losses if the central bank    surprises with a larger-than-expected rate cut later in the day.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to cut    rates when its monetary policy board meets on Tuesday. Investors    are pricing in an easing of 50 basis points to 5.5 percent, with    weak data on Monday backing views that the credit crunch was    taking a toll on the Australian economy.    * The RBA stunned financial markets last month by slashing    the cash rate by 100 basis points as it stepped up its effort to    cushion the economy from the turmoil in financial markets.    * A cut on Tuesday will come just days after the U.S. Federal    Reserve and the Bank of Japan lowered rates last week. The Bank    of England and the European Central Bank are also expected to    ease this week to support their struggling economies.    * By 9:30 a.m. (2230 GMT) the Aussie eased to $0.6770    from $0.6816 late here on Monday. It has still gained over 10    percent since it struck a 5-   year low of $0.6007 last month on    hopes that a raft of rate cuts by major central banks would help    the global economy escape a recession.    * The Aussie dipped to 67.12 yen, from 67.67 yen    late here on Monday, as investors favoured the relative safety of    lower-yielding currencies and government bonds on a report    showing factory output in the United States fell to its lowest in    26 years in October.    * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of    national factory activity fell to 38.9 in October, its weakest    level since 1982, adding to evidence of a sharp global downturn.    * Australian bond futures were higher as safe-haven inflows    resumed, buoyed by rate cut expectations in the coming months.    Three-year bond futures rose 0.07 points to 95.49, while    the 10-year futures contract added 0.07 points to 94.67.
