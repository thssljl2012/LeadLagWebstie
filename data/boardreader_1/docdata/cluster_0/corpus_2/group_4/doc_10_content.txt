That was under forecasts of a 0.5 percent    increase, but the second quarter was revised up to show a 0.2    percent dip from the initial 0.6 percent fall.    ___________________________________  ____________________________    * The Australian dollar remained under pressure on Monday as    disappointment over a lack of concrete proposals from the G20    reignited risk aversion and hit stocks across Asia.    * Data on third-quarter inflation-adjusted retail sales were    softer-than-expected, though that was balanced somewhat by an    upward revision to the previous quarter.    * The soft retail numbers combined with weak auto sales    suggests consumption made little if any contribution to economic    growth in the quarter, adding to the risk of a contraction.    * The Aussie was off at $0.6410, having been as low as    $0.6363 in early trade from $0.6586 in New York on Friday.    * The currency found support under $0.6360, leading to    speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was buying as it    had done last week.    * Instead had investors turned risk averse again after Wall    Street&amp;#039;s late slide on Friday and figures showing a record    fall in U.S. retail sales.    * The Aussie lapsed to 61.89 yen, from peaks    around 64.95 in New York, as safe haven flows lifted the Japanese    currency across the board.    * Even data showing Japan officially slipped into recession    in the third quarter benefited the yen by creating    yet more risk aversion.    * The rush to safety in turn benefited bonds. Three-year bond    futures rose as much as 0.135 points to an all-time high    of 96.280. The 10-year contract added 0.130 to 95.090.    * Australian bill futures continue to price in a    rate cut of at least 75 basis points at the RBA&amp;#039;s next policy    meeting in December.    * The minutes of the RBA&amp;#039;s November policy meeting are due on    Tuesday and analysts are keen to hear why it decided to cut by a    larger-than-expected 75 basis points.    * RBA Governor Glenn Stevens and RBA Assistant Governor    Malcolm Edey both speak on Wednesday.
