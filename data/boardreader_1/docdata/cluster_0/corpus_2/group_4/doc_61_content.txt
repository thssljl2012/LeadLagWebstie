SYDNEY, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar was holding    relatively steady on Wednesday after a choppy offshore session    saw it bounce as U.S. stocks rallied, and investors awaited    speeches from the central bank later in the day.    * The local currency was hovering around $0.6510,    having recovered from a $0.6405 low as Wall Street made    one of its mysterious late charges.    * Support seen around $0.6350 and the possibility of more    intervention from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is putting    a floor under the currency for the moment.    *  Aussie also finding some support around 61.75 yen , allowing it to creep up to 63.25, though fresh sell    orders are seen at 64.00.    * Overall, sentiment remains bearish on the Aussie given the    prospect of global recession -- there were more dismal housing    data out of the U.S. on Tuesday -- and the    expectations of more aggressive rate cuts here.    * The central bank features large on Wednesday with RBA    Governor Glenn Stevens speaking on &amp;#039;The Economic Situation&amp;#039; at    8:35 p.m. (0935 GMT).    * He is preceded by Assistant Governor Malcolm Edey speaking    on &amp;#039;The Economy in Late 2008: Conditions and Prospects&amp;#039; at 2:50    p.m. (0350 GMT).    * Analysts are hoping for guidance on how much they might cut    interest rates at the December policy meeting, though events are    moving so fast that the comments might have a short shelf-life.    * The market is already pricing in a cut of at least 75 basis    points in the 5.25 percent cash rate, and further drastic easing    to 3.5 percent next year, so it might be vulnerable to a pullback    if the governors are less than outright bearish.    * Australian bond futures traded firmer, buoyed by a strong    performance from U.S Treasuries which saw two-year yields touch    their lowest levels since 2003.    * Three-year bond futures rose 0.055 points to    96.225, while the 10-year contract added 0.045 to 95.075.    * Commodities were mostly softer. Oil lost 52 cents    to $54.43, while the CRB index shed 0.61 percent to    242.35.
