 LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - European shares ended lower on Monday as mounting concerns about a global recession and Citigroup&amp;#039;s (C.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) plan to slash about 50,000 jobs hurt bank stocks, while miners tracked weaker metals prices.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 closed 2.6 percent lower at 837.41 points. The benchmark has lost more than 44 percent this year, hit by a credit crisis.
