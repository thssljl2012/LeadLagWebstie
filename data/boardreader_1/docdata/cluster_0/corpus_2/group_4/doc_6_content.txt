By Rafael Nam    HONG KONG, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Thursday to their lowest this month on uncertainty about whether the United States can succeed in its massive banking rescue and as Intel Corp&amp;#039;s revenue warning stoked corporate earnings worries.    Evaporating confidence in the global economy led crude prices to hit a 22-month low of $55 a barrel, even after OPEC President Chakib Khelil indicated the oil-producing cartel may cut supply again. Metals such as platinum also dropped.    The Japanese yen retreated against the euro and the dollar after soaring on Wednesday on a flight-to-quality. Other Asian currencies fell, while Australia&amp;#039;s central bank stepped in to support its tumbling Australian dollar.    &amp;#039;There isn&amp;#039;t a lot of light right now,&amp;#039; said Hiroaki Osakabe, a fund manager at Chibagin Asset Management in Japan.    &amp;#039;With so many grim forecasts and the situation in developing nations growing worse, things are tough.&amp;#039;    The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan dropped 5.7 percent after at one point hitting its lowest level since Oct. 30.    Asian shares followed Wall Street lower after the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday backed away from using a $700 billion bailout fund to buy bad mortgage debt from lenders to focus instead on buying stakes in the U.S. banks themselves.  and    The shift in focus not only created uncertainty, but came after a raft of recent gloomy economic data worldwide.    Data showed China&amp;#039;s industrial output slumped to a seven-year low last month as manufacturers throttled back production in response to weakness in the domestic property market and an unfolding slowdown in export demand.    Intel Corp&amp;#039;s cut in fourth-quarter revenue forecast, citing weak demand across the world for all its products , added to the worries.    Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei average dropped 6.3 percent, with technology exporters such as Sony Corp hit as well by concerns about the impact from a stronger yen.    Other markets also took a beating: South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong fell 5-6 percent each.    Taiwan and Singapore dropped 3-4 percent each. However, Shanghai gained 1.7 percent on hopes China&amp;#039;s spending plan would spur economic growth.    AUSSIE, RUPIAH SLUMP    The yen retreated from a two-week high against the euro as short-term players locked in profits, though it still retained its overall strength as investors remain wary of riskier assets.    The euro rebounded sharply to 119.20 yen, up 0.3 percent from late U.S. trade, after briefly falling as low as 117.65 yen, the lowest since Oct. 28, on trading platform EBS in earlier Asian trade.    The dollar also recovered from the day&amp;#039;s low of 94.53 yen to 95.67 yen, up 0.7 percent on the day.    Other Asian and Pacific currencies fared worse. The battered Australian dollar edged up to $0.6410 after the central bank said it had intervened to support its sliding currency.    The Indonesian rupiah fell almost 4 percent to hit 11,950 per dollar, its weakest since April 2001, following new government restrictions on foreign exchange purchases.    OIL SLUMPS    Commodity prices crumbled further on concern sputtering economic growth would curb demand for everything from oil to grain and on widespread risk aversion.    U.S. crude futures fell for a third consecutive day, down 63 cents to $55.53, after earlier falling to $55.03 -- the lowest since Jan. 29, 2007.    The drop came even after OPEC President Khelil told Reuters the organisation could cut oil supplies again, possibly by the end of this month. Oil prices have slumped since hitting a record of just above $147 a barrel in July.    &amp;#039;Oil prices continue to be pressured by fears that weaker international economic growth will depress oil consumption,&amp;#039; said David Moore, an analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.    Platinum fell at one point to a bid of $780.00 but rebounded to $794.00 later in the day, still well below the New York notional close of $810.    But regional government bonds gained from the volatility elsewhere, with Japan&amp;#039;s December 10-year JGB futures up 0.42 point to 138.51, after climbing as high as 138.79.
