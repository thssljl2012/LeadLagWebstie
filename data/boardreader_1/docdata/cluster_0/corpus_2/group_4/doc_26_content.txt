 November 10, 2008    Article from:  The Associated Press        THE Australian share market closed 1.4 per cent higher today, buoyed by mining stocks in anticipation that China&amp;#039;s $884 billion economic stimulus plan would increase demand for resources.         At the 4.15pm (AEDT) close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 56.5 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 4107.8.      The broader All Ordinaries index rose 1.3 per cent higher, up 53.4 points to 4060.      China&amp;#039;s $884 billion plan to kick-start growth pushed the local share market higher, with energy stocks benefiting,said IG Markets institutional sales trader Chris Weston.      &amp;amp;quot;It is about one-fifth of their GDP, so we&amp;#039;re seeing a lot of these mid-tier miners are going to benefit because it will add about two per cent to (China&amp;#039;s) GDP,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Mr Weston.      China accounted for 27 per cent of global economic growth last year, so the package should help avert a global recession, IG Markets research analyst Ben Potter said in a note to clients.      Australia&amp;#039;s major miners were up on the news.  BHP Billiton jumped 7.02 per cent  to $29.89.       Rio Tinto rose almost 8 per cent, up $5.73 to $78.00.  Rio Tinto announced it will cut production of iron ore by 10 per cent because of less demand from China.      Energy stocks also rose on the Chinese plan.  Santos closed 3.84 per cent higher at $14.34 and Woodside Petroleum was up 3.54 per cent to $41.21.      China&amp;#039;s stimulus package gave a &amp;amp;quot;fundamental floor&amp;#039;&amp;#039; to energy stocks, Mr Weston said.      &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re expecting the stimulus package to feed through from the first quarter of next year and growth to start hitting home,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.      However, the big banks suffered significant losses despite a good lead from Wall Street, he said.      At close of trade, Commonwealth Bank lost 5.17 per cent to $38.00 and Westpac was down 5.19 per cent to $19.91.      ANZ lost 2.39 per cent to $15.90 and St George eased 2.27 per cent to $27.61.      NAB was in a trading halt after announcing a $2 billion institutional capital raising at $20 a share, which prompted a flurry of interest from investors.      &amp;amp;quot;The offer is significantly oversubscribed,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; NAB deputy chief executive Michael Ullmer told AAP.      &amp;amp;quot;I believe the books closed at 12.30pm (AEDT), and the underwriters are now going through the allocation process.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Fund manager Perpetual re-opened application for its frozen income and mortgage funds, and its shares rose $1.34 to $37.54.      On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract had added 10 points to 4,134 on a volume of 38,946 contracts.
