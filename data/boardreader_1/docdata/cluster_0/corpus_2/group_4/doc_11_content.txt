The damned black market cash in swiss accounts would be over-flooded with cash in trillions racked in from many around the world. Asian Markets Slump; Nikkei Falls More than 4% ASIAN MARKETS, STOCKS, SHARES, NIKKEI, KOSPI, SHANGHAI COMPOSITE, HANG SENG, STRAITS TIMES INDEX, SYDNEY, SEOUL Reuters   12 Nov 2008   07:44 PM ET Asian markets fell Thursday after U.S. stocks took another tumble, with Intel adding fuel to the selloff by cutting its fourth-quarter sales forecast.

There&amp;#039;s very little treated as good news,&amp;quot; said Austock Group strategist Michael Heffernan. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index was down 154 points at 3,773.3, after slipping 0.9 percent on Wednesday.
