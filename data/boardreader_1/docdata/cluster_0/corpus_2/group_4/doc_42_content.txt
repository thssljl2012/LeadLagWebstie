Investors now    pricing in a cut of more than a full percentage point in    December, and further easing to 3.25 percent by March.    * The Aussie dollar plunged three U.S. cents and three yen as    U.S. stocks dived for a second day and investors piled into    sovereign bonds, driving 10-year U.S. yields to 50-year lows.    * A spokesman for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said it    had acted to provide liquidity, as it has done on several recent    occasions when the market became disorderly. It intervened in    October to buy a record A$3.15 billion.    * The Aussie tumbled as far as $0.6075 after major support    around $0.6350 finally gave way, and the RBA&amp;#039;s action only    managed to nudge it up to $0.6100.    * Traders say a test of 60 cents seems inevitable, followed    by a move toward 57 and 54 cents.    * Aussie also down around 57.40 yen, after breaking 60.00,    and heading back toward October&amp;#039;s deep lows near 55.00 yen.    * Wall Street dived again with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 off over 6    percent for a second straight session, following more dismal U.S.    economic data. The Nikkei lost a further 3    percent on Friday.    * Bank stocks were hammered, with Citi down over 26    percent, sparking talk it might have to find a merger partner.    * The flight to safety sent sovereign bonds soaring. Yields    on U.S. two-year yields dropped below the Fed&amp;#039;s 1.0 percent cash    target while the curve flattened on talk of deflation.    * Aussie bond futures followed with huge gains. Three-year    bond futures surged 0.210 points to 96.530, having    touched a fresh record at 96.540, while the 10-year contract  jumped 0.205 to 95.445.    * The Swiss National Bank stunned markets on Thursday by    cutting its rates 100 basis points to a range of 0.5 to 1.5    percent, a complete surprise.
