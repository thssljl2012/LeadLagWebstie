 ZURICH, April 21 (Reuters)  -   Swiss shares were seen opening    weaker on Tuesday as global markets took fright again after a    big increase in bad loans at Bank of America.          The blue-chip index SMI was indicated to open 10    points down at 5,055 points, according to data provided by    Clariden Leu.        Shares in Actelion Ltd were indicated up 3.3    percent after it more than doubled its profit in the first    quarter, beating analysts' expectations.
