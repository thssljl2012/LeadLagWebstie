Copper falls 4.1pc on global economic worries April 21, 2009 Reuters INDUSTRIAL metals prices fell as renewed concerns about the global economy scuttled rallies in metals and equities. Copper for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchanges COMEX division fell US9.05c, or 4.1 per cent, to settle at $US2.1035 a pound. On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three months delivery last traded at $US4590/4595 a tonne versus Fridays settlement at $US4803. Last week, the metal hit a six-month high of $US4925. LME nickel for three months delivery closed at $US12,075 a tonne, having dropped more than 6 per cent to a days low of $US12,025 from $US12,850 a tonne on Friday, while lead fell to $US1465 a tonne from $US1555 and hit a days low of $US1460 - also a fall of over 6 per cent. Its a combination of the strong dollar and weaker equities  sentiment seems to have taken a bit of a turn around, said Gayle Berry, an analyst at Barclays Capital. The dollar rallied broadly amid a worldwide sell-off in equities after a surge in troubled loans at Bank of America and renewed signs of economic weakness triggered a wave of risk aversion. The flight to quality indicators - bonds, treasuries, gold, and the dollar - are all up in the same direction, and thats telling you that fear is coming back into the market, said Frank McGhee, head precious metals trader with Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. Youre seeing other markets such as copper and platinum come off in the face of what appears to be a gloomier economic outlook going forward, he said. The Conference Boards Leading Economic Index, a key gauge of future economic activity, fell for a third straight month in March, suggesting the US recession may persist through summer. Copper, up more than 12 per cent this month and heading for a fourth straight month of gains, has rallied on growing signs of recovery in China and speculation of still-strong demand even after record imports in the month of March.
