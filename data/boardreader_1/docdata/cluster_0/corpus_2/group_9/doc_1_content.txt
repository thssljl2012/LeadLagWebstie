 Strange no-one has manged any positive spin, yet...      http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8009484.stm         Asian shares have fallen sharply in Tuesday trading, echoing declines in the US caused by renewed concerns about the health of the world's banks.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended down 5.1%, its biggest drop in two weeks, while Japan's Nikkei lost 2.2%.   The declines were sparked by Bank of America, the largest in the US, reporting a big increase in the amount of funds it needs to cover bad debt.
