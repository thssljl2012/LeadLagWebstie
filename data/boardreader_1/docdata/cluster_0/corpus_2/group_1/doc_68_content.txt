For sure seems the cut will be passed in all from the banks.   About the rates I recommend a read of this poll from Reuters to the expert economist about rate expectation:    http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&amp;amp;amp;id=103450         Quote:                         Cash rate End 2008 12 months      ABN AMRO 7.0 6.75 6.0      ANZ 7.0 6.75 6.25      Barclays 7.0 n/a n/a      Citi 7.0 6.75 6.5      CBA 7.0 6.75 6.75      4Cast 7.0 6.5 5.75      GSJBW 7.0 6.75 6.25      ICAP 7.0 6.75 6.5      JP Morgan 7.0 6.75 6.25      Lehman 7.0 n/a n/a      Macquarie 7.0 6.5 6.0      Merrill 7.0 6.75 6.25      NAB 7.0 6.75 6.0      Nomura 7.0 6.5 6.25      RBC 7.0 6.75 6.25      St George 7.0 6.75 6.5      Suncorp 7.25 7.25 7.25      TDSec 7.0 6.5 6.0      UBS 7.0 6.75 6.25      Westpac 7.0 6.5 6.0      ---------------------------------------------------------------      Low 7.0 6.5 5.75      High 7.25 7.25 7.25      Average 7.0 6.75 6.25      Median 7.0 6.75 6.25                     Seems 7.0% next week is by far the way to go and I believe the RBA would not surprise the markets.   My opinion is like the median: of 7.0 next week and 6.75 by the end of the year and 6.25 within the first 6 month of the next year.   Of course this poll is done at current data and information and different reading of the economy in the next months would change the forecast.
