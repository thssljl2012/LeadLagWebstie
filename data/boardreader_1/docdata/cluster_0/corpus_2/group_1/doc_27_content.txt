 BQI Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Oil Gains a Third Day on U.S.-Russia Tensions, Dollar Weakness     By Christian Schmollinger and Grant Smith    Aug. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Oil rose on speculation that Russian crude may be disrupted because of rising tensions with the U.S., and as the weaker dollar bolstered the hedging appeal of commodities.     U.S. plans for a missile shield in Poland will ``spur an arms race&amp;#039;&amp;#039; in Europe, Russia&amp;#039;s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. About 1.1 million barrels of Caspian Sea crude remains shuttered following a pipeline fire in Turkey on Aug. 5. Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Georgia closed some export routes that could have been used to re-direct Caspian supplies to Europe.     ``Geopolitical risk in oil-producing regions, as we&amp;#039;re seeing with the tensions between the U.S. and Russia when the spare capacity buffer is low, is making prices volatile,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Thina Saltvedt, a Nordea Bank AB analyst in Oslo. ``Historically the correlation between oil and the dollar is high.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     Crude oil for October delivery rose as much as $1.44, or 1.3 percent, to $117 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange and was trading at $116.75 at 10:46 a.m. in London. Futures are down 21 percent from a July 11 record of $147.27. Prices are 68 percent higher than a year ago.     The September contract expired yesterday after increasing 45 cents, or 0.4 percent, to settle at $114.98 a barrel.     ``It&amp;#039;s really a reaction to the Russians&amp;#039; strong reaction to this missile-shield agreement,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said    Victor Shum   , a senior principal at consultants Purvin &amp;amp;amp; Gertz Inc. in Singapore. ``The concern is for a supply disruption from the world&amp;#039;s second- largest oil producer, Russia.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     Weaker Dollar     The U.S. currency fell against the euro, driving investors to dollar-priced assets like gold and crude. The dollar traded at $1.4792 per euro from $1.4747, after slipping to a one-week low of $1.4832. It fell 1.3 percent to 108.61 yen, the biggest decline since July 15, by 10:44 a.m. in London.

U.S. gasoline    supplies    fell 6.2 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Department said yesterday, more than double analysts&amp;#039; predictions. Analysts had predicted a 3 million-barrel decline, according to a Bloomberg survey.     Motor fuel    demand    was down 1.6 percent from last year&amp;#039;s levels. Oil    stockpiles    rose 9.39 million barrels to 305.9 million barrels, the biggest gain since March 2001.     ``The drawdown in stocks reflects as much refiners adjusting inventories,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said    David Moore   , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in Sydney. ``There isn&amp;#039;t an incentive to build large gasoline inventories&amp;#039;&amp;#039; as long as ``consumption remains soft.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     Brent crude oil for October settlement rose as much as $1.44, or 1.3 percent, to $115.80 a barrel on London&amp;#039;s ICE Futures Europe exchange.
