The currency also declined against the U.S. dollar on speculation the report, forecast by economists to show the region&amp;#039;s economy shrank in the second quarter, will prompt traders to reduce bets on higher       interest rates        in the 15 countries that share the euro. Australia&amp;#039;s dollar gained, snapping a 12-day losing streak, as prices of the commodities the country exports increased.      ``The euro&amp;#039;s weak trend is unlikely to change,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said        Tsutomu Soma       , a bond and currency dealer at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. ``Europe&amp;#039;s economy is facing so many difficulties that I can&amp;#039;t be optimistic on the outlook for the currency.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      The euro declined to 162.93 yen at 11:35 a.m. in Tokyo from 163.43 late yesterday, when it reached a three-month low of 161.40. The euro was at $1.4898 from $1.4919. It fell to a 5 1/2-month low of $1.4816 on Aug. 12. The dollar bought 109.37 yen from 109.53.      The Australian dollar traded at 87.12 U.S. cents from 86.84 cents in late Asian trading yesterday, when it touched 85.93, the lowest since January. It rose to 95.26 yen from 94.60 as the        UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index        gained 2.9 percent, climbing for the first time in four days. Gold, the nation&amp;#039;s third most-valuable raw material export, increased for the first time this month.      The currency pared gains after Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Ric Battellino told lawmakers the central bank cannot wait for inflation to fall before it starts lowering interest rates from a 12-year high of 7.25 percent.      European Economy      Europe&amp;#039;s        economy        shrank 0.2 percent in the second quarter, after 0.7 percent growth in the first, according to the median forecast of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The European Union&amp;#039;s statistics office in Luxembourg will release the data today. Germany&amp;#039;s economy, the largest in the region, probably shrank the most since 1993, a separate survey shows.      Traders have reduced bets the European Central Bank will raise interest rates a second time this year on mounting evidence the slowdown sparked by the collapse of the U.S. housing market is spreading to the region.      The implied yield on the December Euribor futures contract is 4.95 percent, compared with 5.04 percent at the end of July.

Repatriation will play some part in yen strength as there is some comfort in holding funds in your own currency.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Oil Prices      Any gains in the dollar may be limited by speculation a rebound in oil prices will discourage consumer spending in the world&amp;#039;s largest user of the fuel. The U.S. dollar has risen 6.7 percent against the euro in the past month as the price of oil slumped more than 20 percent from a record.      Crude oil for September delivery rose 76 cents to $116.76 a barrel after a U.S. Energy Department report showed a bigger- than-forecast decline in inventories of gasoline.      ``The resurgence of oil prices is causing the market to second-guess if the rebound of the U.S. dollar is temporary in nature,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said        Firas Askari       , head currency trader at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.      Sales at U.S. retailers dropped in July for the first time in five months, the Commerce Department said yesterday in Washington, as record gasoline prices siphoned some of the tax rebates out of consumers&amp;#039; pockets.      The U.S. consumer price index increased 0.4 percent in July, compared with a 1.1 percent gain in June, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the Labor Department report released today in Washington.      Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Gary Stern speaks later today on financial shocks in Three Forks, Montana.      ``Signs that consumer prices are flattening out may support the dollar somewhat,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said       Kengo Suzuki       , a currency strategist at Shinko Securities Co. in Tokyo. ``That would ease concerns that the U.S. will fall into a stagflation.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      To contact the reporters on this story:        Stanley White        in Tokyo at       swhite28@bloomberg.net         Last Updated: August 13, 2008 23:04 EDT
