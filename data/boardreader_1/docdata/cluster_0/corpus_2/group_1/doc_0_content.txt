There is a possibility the company can&amp;#039;t get enough coal and is forced to shut aluminum cells, although it&amp;#039;s extremely costly to do so, Fan Liangong, head of Xinfa&amp;#039;s power generation department, said by phone from Chiping, Shandong province today.     Aluminum jumped to a record last month after Chinese producers agreed to cut output in an attempt to ease the sixth year of power shortages in the world&amp;#039;s fourth-largest economy. A coal shortage has worsened the crisis in China, which gets 80 percent of its power supplies from coal-fired generators.     ``Coal is currently the single largest threat to China&amp;#039;s power market and aluminum smelters,&amp;#039;&amp;#039;    Gayle Berry   , an analyst at Barclays Capital, said in an e-mailed note today.     China&amp;#039;s coal price cap has exacerbated the domestic shortage by encouraging more exports, which doesn&amp;#039;t help aluminum smelters that need large quantities of coal to operate their power plants, she added.     ``It&amp;#039;s very hard to buy coal,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Xinfa&amp;#039;s Fan said. ``We&amp;#039;re doing all our best to ensure power supplies to our aluminum plants&amp;#039;&amp;#039; which have been running normally so far. Like many of its competitors in the eastern province, Xinfa generates its own power to make the energy-intensive metal.     Coal Scarcity     Some aluminum smelters, particularly in Henan province, have increased buying from the national grid because it is cheaper than buying coal to run their captive power stations, Barclays&amp;#039; Berry said.     Chinese thermal coal prices have more than doubled to a record this year as demand rises and as the country closed down small coal mines to improve the environment.     Some Chinese aluminum smelters have cut production by more than the 10 percent agreed to last month and will limit output until the end of the year because of power shortages and weak export demand, Wen Xianjun, deputy chairman of China Nonferrous Metal Industry Association, said Aug 6.     Aluminum smelters in Shandong incur the highest costs of production, between 17,500 and 18,000 yuan ($2,624) a metric ton, in China because of higher coal rates and land prices than other areas, Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts led by Bonnie Liu said in an Aug. 2 report.     Government Order     Every city in Shandong, the country&amp;#039;s second-largest aluminum producing province, has been ordered by the government to either cut power use or suspend production at energy- intensive plants, Shandong Electric Power Corp. said Aug. 6     ``For us, the real threat is coal,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Fan. The government order ``has little to do with us because we don&amp;#039;t use the state grid power,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he added.     By the end of 2008, around 61 percent of Chinese aluminum smelting capacity will be powered by self-installed generators, while another 21 percent will enjoy relatively cheap power tariffs from provincial governments, the Macquarie report said. The remaining 17 percent will have to rely on power from the State Grid at standard industrial tariffs, the report said.     ``Most of China&amp;#039;s self-powered aluminum makers such as Xinfa have been managing to cope despite reported power shortages,&amp;#039;&amp;#039;    Wan Ling   , an analyst at CRU International Ltd., said today by phone from Beijing. It&amp;#039;s hard to say how big any cut would be given the vast difference in cost structure and access to resources among aluminum makers, she added.     Self Powered     Shandong Xinfa&amp;#039;s annual electricity generation capacity is 8 billion kilowatt hours while its aluminum production capacity is 560,000 metric tons, according to its Web site.     Chinese aluminum production will rise by 16 percent to 14.6 million tons this year, even after production losses in winter snowstorms and a 10-percent output cut pledge by 20 producers in July, Macquarie forecasted in its report.     Aluminum for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 0.4 percent down at 18,770 yuan per metric ton today. Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange fell 1.5 percent to $2,874.75 a ton at 5:13 p.m. in Shanghai.
