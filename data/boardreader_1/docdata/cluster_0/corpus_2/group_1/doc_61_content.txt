          Three Days Before RBA Rate Cut Announcement, Wizard cuts home loan rate.   Wizard cuts home loan rate   August 31, 2008 12:06am Article from: AAP  WIZARD Home Loans has become the first lender to cut its variable interest rate in seven years. The announcement comes three days before the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decides whether to implement a rate cut.  Economists say a combination of a slowing economy, deteriorating business conditions and tight credit markets will ensure the central bank cuts interest rates this week.  Wizard chairman Mark Bouris says he has challenged banks to pass on a fairer share of their profits, the Sunday Telegraph reports.  &amp;amp;quot;This signals the return of competition in the banking sector,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Bouris said. &amp;amp;quot;The banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins, but this will bring them back in line.&amp;amp;quot;  Wizard will cut its variable rate from 9.54 to 9.29 per cent effective from this morning.  Mr Bouris said the cut, which would take Wizard to about 0.32 per cent below the typical rate of the major banks, would remain even if the RBA decides to keep rates on hold.  Wizard has the financial backing of GE Money, part of US conglomerate General Electric.  The RBA is widely expected to cut the cash rate by 0.25 per cent to 7 per cent on Tuesday. &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;amp;#039;s a risk, but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen, irrespective of the cash rate, and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers.&amp;amp;quot;    http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24269606-29277,00.html
