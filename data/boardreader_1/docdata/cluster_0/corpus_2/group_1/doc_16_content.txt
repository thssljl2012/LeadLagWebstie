        Quote:            Credit crunch: World stockmarkets fall further            * Graeme Wearden        * guardian.co.uk,        * Tuesday August 19 2008 18:05 BST            Stock markets around the world have fallen today amid fresh fears that the credit crunch will cause further damage to the banking sector.        London and New York were both bathed in red after predictions from a well-respected economist that another bank may collapse before the crisis is over.        The FTSE 100 index closed down 129.8 points to 5320.4, following further weakness on Wall Street and overnight falls in Asian markets.        Banks such as HBOS and Barclays led the London fallers, along with miners and energy companies, which were hit by concerns over the slowing global economy.        The global sell-off began last night in America, sparked by a report that the US government will have to step in to rescue Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, leaving investors with almost nothing.        With rumours of fresh writedowns at Lehman Brothers also sweeping trading floors, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 180 points yesterday, a 1.5% fall. It was down another 114 points by 6pm BST to 11,364.9.        Shares in both mortgage finance firms plunged yesterday, with Freddie losing 25% and Fannie 22%, and fell further on Tuesday as speculation about their futures intensified. They have already filed massive losses because of the slump in the US housing market. Analysts said a government bail-out would lead to renewed fears that the worst of the financial crisis is to come.        &amp;amp;quot;The bail-out itself isn&amp;#039;t what scares investors per se, as these government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) have always been implicitly backed by the US government. However, the fact that they have to be bailed out doesn&amp;#039;t bode well for the housing financial sector and more specifically the mortgage-related investments that sparked the credit crunch in the first place,&amp;amp;quot; said David Evans, market analyst at BetOnMarkets.com.        The bearish sentiment also spread to Japan, where the Nikkei index dropped 2.3% overnight to its lowest level in a month.        Comments made overnight by former International Monetary Fund chief economist Kenneth Rogoff added to the gloomy sentiment. According to Reuters, Rogoff, who was the IMF&amp;#039;s chief economist from 2001 to 2004, told a financial conference that he expected a large US bank to fail in the next few months.        &amp;amp;quot;The US is not out of the woods. I think the financial crisis is at the halfway point, perhaps. I would even go further to say the worst is to come,&amp;amp;quot; said Rogoff, who is now an economics professor at Harvard University.        &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re not just going to see mid-sized banks go under in the next few months, we&amp;#039;re going to see a whopper, we&amp;#039;re going to see a big one, one of the big investment banks or big banks.&amp;amp;quot;
