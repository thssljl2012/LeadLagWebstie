SYDNEY, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar dropped to its lowest in more than four months against a resurgent U.S. currency on Friday, pulled down by growing expectations of domestic interest rate cuts in coming months.    The Aussie dollar  dropped to $0.8993, its lowest since March 24 and down from $0.9110/14 late here on Thursday.    Financial markets  are fully pricing in a 50 basis points rate cut in September, the first reduction by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in seven years, amid cooling demand in the economy.
