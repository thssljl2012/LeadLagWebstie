SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar was on the defensive near three-month lows against the U.S. currency on Monday, and dropped to a fresh two-month trough against the yen as renewed risk aversion hit global markets.    * The Aussie was also under pressure on growing talk of domestic rate cuts. Speculation of a near term cut has gathered pace amid a slowing economy and increased banking sector losses stemming from exposure to distressed credit markets.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s (RBA) monetary policy board meets on Tuesday and the outcome will be announced at 2:30 p.m. (0430 GMT).    * Markets are pricing in a 30 percent chance of a rate cut this week, but analysts doubt it. A Reuters poll of 21 economists on Friday found none expected a move this week but did see a 30 percent chance of a cut in September. [ID:SYD254758].    * Domestic second-quarter house price numbers are out later on Monday and are expected to show a decline of 1 percent in the quarter, reflecting cooling demand in the economy.    * The Aussie dollar  was at $0.9288/91, down from $0.9374/75 late here on Friday. It dropped to a three-month low of $0.9283 in offshore trade.    * The Aussie has fallen sharply in the past two weeks as spreads between two-year U.S. and Australian government bond yields shrank to 368 basis points, their lowest this year, diminishing some of the Aussie&amp;#039;s yield appeal.    * The U.S. dollar climbed broadly on Friday as U.S. data were not as dire as many feared. U.S. employers shed 51,000 jobs in July, lower than market expectations for a decline of 75,000.    * A separate report said U.S. factory activity was unchanged in July, compared with the previous month, but above market forecasts. [ID:nN01429062]    * The Aussie fell to two-month lows against the yen , easing to 99.80 yen. The Japanese currency benefited from heightened stress in financial markets on news that General Motors  posted hefty losses in the second quarter. That news dragged Wall Street stocks lower and led investors pare carry trade positions.    * Currency speculators cut their bets on the Australian dollar and increased it in favour of the U.S. currency, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. The net long positions on the Aussie dollar fell to 28,919 contracts in the week to July 29 from 53,588 a week earlier. [nN01397876].    * Australian bond futures continued to add to last week&amp;#039;s impressive gains. They benefited from expectations of local rate cuts and safe haven inflows which gathered pace after stock markets lost ground late last week.    * Three-year bond futures  rose 0.030 points to 93.970 while the 10-year bond contract  added 0.010 points to 93.910.
