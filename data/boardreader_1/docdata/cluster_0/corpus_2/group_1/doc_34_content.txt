WELLINGTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar  was broadly steady on Friday, finding support as Thursday&amp;#039;s strength in the U.S. dollar waned, but with an underlying note of caution given prospects for domestic rate cuts.    The kiwi was not able to muster any momentum to break out of a $0.6900-0.7100 range which has contained it this week, and is expected to remain rangebound ahead of an interest rate review next month.    &amp;#039;Expect the fortunes of the NZ dollar to be closely tied to U.S. dollar sentiment,&amp;#039; said Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Danica Hampton.&amp;#039;    At 0500 GMT the New Zealand dollar was at $0.7050/60 compared with $0.7053/63 in late local trading on Thursday. It traded a local range of $0.7014 to $0.7056.    The kiwi followed broader market events, which saw the U.S. dollar slip against a basket of currencies as geopolitical issues pushed up oil prices, raising concerns about U.S. growth.    There was little reaction to domestic data showing new building consents rose a seasonally adjusted 4.7 percent in July, the first rise in three months, although the number issued was still down 35 percent on a year ago. See [nWEL000742]    The continued low level of consents was seen as further evidence of the housing slowdown and the economy being in recession.    &amp;#039;While we think that the decline in consent issuance has reached a bottom, we expect it to continue to languish around these low levels for some time yet,&amp;#039; said ASB Bank economist Jane Turner.    New Zealand&amp;#039;s central bank is widely expected to deliver a further cut in its 8 percent cash rate on Sept. 11, after easing policy for the first time in five years in July.    Investors were cautious of commiting ahead of the U.S. markets&amp;#039; long weekend, and were also turning their attention to next week&amp;#039;s Australian central bank rate review.    Markets have priced in a quarter percentage point cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) next week, which would be the first cut in seven years and diminish the Aussie dollar&amp;#039;s yield appeal.    &amp;#039;Should the RBA statement temper easing expectations and Australian data continue suggest the economy is holding up okay, expect to see downward pressure on the NZ-Aussie dollar cross,&amp;#039; BNZ&amp;#039;s Hampton said.    New Zealand bonds firmed for a fourth day, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond , which moves inversely to the price, two basis points lower at 5.99 percent.
