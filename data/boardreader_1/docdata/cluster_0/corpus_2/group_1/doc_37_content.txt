       Hi Mike, Not that I wish you any ill wind, but....   DJ US GAS: Futures Close Higher Amid Tropical Storm Threat By Jason Womack             Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES             HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Natural gas futures rose Wednesday in anticipation of             Tropical Storm Gustav entering the Gulf of Mexico at hurricane strength.             Natural gas for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed             20.7 cents higher, or up 2.5%, at $8.485 a million British thermal units. The             contract rose as high as $8.777/MMBtu in combined electronic and floor trading.             &amp;amp;quot;The storm trumps everything,&amp;amp;quot; said Mike Fitzpatrick, a broker with MF Global             in New York. &amp;amp;quot;That&amp;#039;s the only consideration at this point.&amp;amp;quot;             Tropical Storm Gustav, which weakened overnight, was expected to reach             hurricane strength as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, a key U.S. energy             production region.             The Gulf accounts for a quarter of U.S. oil production and 14% of natural gas             production. It is also home to about a third of the country&amp;#039;s refining             capacity.             The energy markets closely watch storms that have the potential to threaten             the Gulf and disrupt energy supplies as Hurricanes Rita and Katrina did in             2005.             The storm was tracking directly over the Independence Hub, a key natural gas             production platform in the Gulf.               Scott Hanold, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, projected that the storm             would have a potential impact of 10 million barrels of oil and 60 billion cubic             feet of natural gas.             Jim Rouiller, senior energy meteorologist with the private forecasting firm             Planalytics, expected Gustav to achieve at least a Category 3 status by the             time it reached the Gulf of Mexico over the Labor Day weekend.             &amp;amp;quot;This storm remains likely to explode into a major hurricane over the             northwestern Caribbean on Friday,&amp;amp;quot; Rouiller wrote in a note to clients.             Traders were buying back gas contracts in order to hedge against the storm             threat and to prepare for the holiday weekend, when the Nymex trading floor             will be closed.             &amp;amp;quot;It makes it very difficult to go home short on Friday,&amp;amp;quot; said George Hopley,             an energy analyst with Barclays Capital in New York.             Prices rose Wednesday despite expectations for an above-average build in             natural gas storage. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is expected to             report Thursday that 83 billion cubic feet of natural gas were added to storage             for the week ended Aug. 22, according to analysts and traders surveyed by Dow             Jones Newswires.             The estimated storage build is well above the five-year average of 40 bcf and             last year&amp;#039;s 38 bcf build, according to the EIA.             Wednesday also marked the expiration of the September natural gas futures             contract.             However, the build in storage and the expiration of the contract were having             little effect on prices.             &amp;amp;quot;I think that would have been priced in earlier, before Gustav formed,&amp;amp;quot; said             Lisa Zembrodt, a commodity analyst with Summit Energy in Louisville, Ky.             -By Jason Womack, Dow Jones Newswires; (713) 547-9201;             jason.womack@dowjones.com
