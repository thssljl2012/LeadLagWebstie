The RBA would have been aware of these tax cuts coming up all year, and would have already taken this into consideration while they were moving rates up. The RBA actually put out forward estimates (which I accept they often get wrong) and they base these forward estimates on what they know is in scope for the future. The tax cuts were a known event.        It will have the opposite effect. A fall in oil prices will further ease inflationary pressures, making a rate cut even more likely.        Perhaps they will wait until November, but I think they could move as early as September, but more likely October.    Shadow.                      Hi Shadow,    not trying to cause a fight, so I appreciate your response and POV.     I&amp;#039;m just responding to  this quote :       Quote:                         However, two economists are tipping a rate cut by Christmas, while nine are predicting rate relief in the March quarter of 2009 as Australia&amp;#039;s economy weakens.    The Commonwealth Bank is alone in expecting an interest rate rise by the end of 2008, based on the likelihood that falling petrol prices will spark a recovery in consumer spending.                     The RBA is targetting consumer spending  specifically  in their war on inflation.  Punters have pulled back on spending becuase they&amp;#039;ve had less dosh in their pockets and less optimism due to rising costs. IF petrol prices fall, and the income tax cuts fuel more spending then while inflation should fall along with petrol, consumption is again causing inflationary pressure.  Two opposites but if consumer spending rises again and inflation is still above 3% (which it will be this year at least) then a rate cut is out of the question.  But that relies on petrol prices still falling, so we&amp;#039;ll see.    And June&amp;#039;s downturn in retail sales followed a jump in May.  Although retail sales have slowed so far this year they&amp;#039;re nowhere near slow enough for the RBA&amp;#039;s liking yet.   Remember we still got CPI of 1.5% &amp;amp;amp; core inflation of 1.2% for the Jun qtr, and that includes these recent June retail spending numbers.   Any more retail spending and we&amp;#039;d be discussing a rate hike!     And yes, you&amp;#039;re right the RBA is aware of the income tax cuts.  My guess is that is why they&amp;#039;ve maintained their tightening bias to date and talked up a possible rate hike(s) this year rather than the opposite.  Still, they&amp;#039;ll be cautiously optimistic that inflation will slow - but they can&amp;#039;t be even remotely sure until November.  They cannot cut while there&amp;#039;s a possibility that they&amp;#039;ll need to raise again shortly after to combat inflation.  They will all get sacked if they flip flop.    Still, a rate cut is on the table now for this year where before it wasn&amp;#039;t, but it&amp;#039;s wait and see on monetary policy for now.    Cheers    EDIT: changed &amp;amp;quot;inflation&amp;amp;quot; to &amp;amp;quot;retail spending&amp;amp;quot; as that&amp;#039;s what I meant!
