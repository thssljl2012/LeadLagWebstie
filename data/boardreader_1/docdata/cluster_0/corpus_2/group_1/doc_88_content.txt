 Wizard are pretty confident they&amp;#039;re going down by at least 0.25%....       Wizard cuts home loan interest rate            Quote:                         WIZARD Home Loans has become the first lender to cut its variable interest rate in seven years.   The announcement comes three days before the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decides whether to implement a rate cut.    ...   Wizard will cut its variable rate from 9.54 to 9.29 per cent effective from this morning.       Mr Bouris said the cut, which would take Wizard to about 0.32 per cent below the typical rate of the major banks, would remain even if the RBA decides to keep rates on hold.    ...   The RBA is widely expected to cut the cash rate by 0.25 per cent to 7 per cent on Tuesday.    &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s a risk, but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen, irrespective of the cash rate, and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers.&amp;amp;quot;
