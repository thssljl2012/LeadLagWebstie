SYDNEY, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar  consolidated above 11-month lows on Thursday, helped by higher commodities, better risk appetite and a weaker U.S. currency, but expectations of interest rate cuts kept limited gains.    * Futures are pricing in a quarter-percentage point rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) early next week to support flagging growth. The cut would be the first in seven years.    * Second-quarter construction spending data was surprisingly weak and investors now turn their focus to second-quarter capital expenditure figures due at 11:30 a.m.(0130 GMT).    * Analysts are looking for a rise of 2.0 percent in the second quarter, a turnaround from a decline of 2.5 percent in the first quarter, but the series is notoriously volatile.    * By 9:30 a.m. the Aussie dollar  was at $0.8581/83, slightly lower than $0.8593/95 late here on Wednesday, and well above $0.8493 struck earlier this week which was its lowest since Sept. 19, 2007.    * The U.S. dollar retreated from six-month highs against the euro  after European Central Bank board member Alex Weber doused talk of a euro zone interest rate cut [nLR715001].    * Higher commodities also offered support to the Aussie. The CRB commodities index  rose 0.7 percent, led by oil and gold prices. Crude rose above $118 a barrel while gold was quoted at $827.50/829.50 an ounce in Asian trade, having added 0.5 percent on Wednesday. Australia is a big exporter of resources.    * The Aussie inched up to 93.94 yen , helped by better risk appetite after stocks on Wall Street rose. Surprisingly strong U.S. durable goods data, soothed some concerns about the economy and underpinned demand for carry trades.    * Australian bonds were higher, supported by expectations of a local interest rate cut. Three-year bond futures  were up 0.01 point to 94.41, while the 10-year bond contract  rose 0.01 points to 94.325.
