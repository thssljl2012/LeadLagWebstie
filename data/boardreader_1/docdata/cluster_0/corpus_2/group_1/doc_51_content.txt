   Whoops.....................            Oil vaults above $121 a barrel             Article            Comments      (  52 )                STEVENSON JACOBS  The Associated Press  August 21, 2008 at 12:44 PM EDT     NEW YORK  Oil prices shot up more than $5 (U.S.) a barrel Thursday, rising tothe highest level in more than two weeks as escalating tensions withRussia stoked fears of a disruption of energy shipments to Westerncountries.  Crude&amp;#039;s rally mimicked the wild price swings seen last month and haveat least temporarily halted oil&amp;#039;s slide back toward $100 a barrel. Aweaker U.S. dollar and worries about tightening output from OPECcountries are also supporting prices.  After days of brushing off geopolitical flare-ups, oil spiked above$122 a barrel as traders became rattled over increasingly hostileRussian rhetoric toward a U.S.-Poland deal to install a missile defencesystem in Eastern Europe  a move Moscow views as a threat.  The continued presence of Russian troops in Georgia injected even morebullish sentiment into a market that had appeared to be losing momentumas high energy prices force people around the world to cut back onenergy use.  Light, sweet crude for October delivery jumped $5.55 to $121.11 abarrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising as highas $122.04, crude&amp;#039;s highest trading level since Aug. 4.  The sellers are backing away for now, said Jim Ritterbusch, presidentof energy consultancy Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Ill. Ifmilitary activity heats up again, pipeline flows into Europe could bedisrupted and that would affect the United States as well.  The price jump came as retail gas prices continued to fall, sheddingmore than a penny overnight to a new national average of $3.702,according to auto club AAA, the Oil Price Information Service andWright Express. Prices have now fallen 10 per cent from record highsabove $4 a gallon set July 17, but the pace of the drop off could slowif oil holds onto Thursday&amp;#039;s gains.  This is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop. We may be afew cents away from the August bottom, said Tom Kloza, publisher andchief analyst at the Oil Price Information Service in Wall, N.J.  Oil&amp;#039;s jump came a day after the U.S. government report a huge rise inU.S. crude inventories. But other supplies were less abundant.  Gasoline inventories shrank by a larger-than-expected 6.2 millionbarrels to below-average levels in the week ended Aug. 15, the U.S.Energy Department&amp;#039;s Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.Meanwhile, distillate inventories  which include heating oil anddiesel fuel  rose by less than expected, the EIA said.  That was enough to offset a hefty 9.4 million barrel rise in U.S. crudestocks last week when the average analyst forecast had been for a 1.7million barrel increase, according to energy information providerPlatts.  That report had something for everyone, said David Moore, a commoditystrategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. On the onehand, the crude inventory buildup was quite strong, but the gasolinedraw was also very prominent.  But growing concerns over Russia&amp;#039;s standoff with Georgia and NATO grabbed the attention of most oil traders Thursday.  On Wednesday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her Polishcounterpart signed a deal to build an American missile defence base inPoland. Last week, a top Russian general warned Poland was risking anattack, possibly a nuclear one, by developing the base.  JBC Energy in Vienna said the political risk premium of oil priceshad widened to more than $10 a barrel, which could be attributed atleast in part to the Russian angle.  Investors are also trying to anticipate the outcome of the nextOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in earlySeptember, as supply concerns could rise further if members of thecartel decide to lower their output in response to slower demand.Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said he might propose an outputcut at the next OPEC meeting.  U.S. energy consultancy Cameron Hanover noted in its daily marketreport that some members of the oil group were terrified of allowingWestern countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected,because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainableeconomic levels and interfere with OPEC&amp;#039;s ability to keep buildingmassive foreign currency reserves.  Oil prices have rebounded after falling about $35, or nearly a quarter,from their all-time trading record $147.27 on July 11. Many investorsexpect that high gasoline prices and slowing economic growth in theU.S., Europe and Japan will undermine global energy demand.  Prices were supported Thursday by a weaker dollar compared to the euro.A falling greenback encourages investors to seek commodities such asoil as a hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar.  The slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bear&amp;#039;ssail in the energy complex, said The Schork Report, edited by analystand trader Stephen Schork.  In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures rose 14.10 cents to $3.3045a gallon, while gasoline prices gained 11.47 cents to $3.025 a gallon.Natural gas futures increased 9.3 cents to $8.171 per 1,000 cubic feet.  In London, October Brent crude rose $5.63 to $119.99 a barrel.
