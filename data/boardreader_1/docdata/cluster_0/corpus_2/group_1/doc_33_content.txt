The euro dropped below $1.50 for the first time since February after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday said economic growth will be ``particularly weak&amp;#039;&amp;#039; through the third quarter.      ``We are now seeing a lot more negative surprises coming out of Europe than from the U.S., more so than any time during this credit shock,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Jim McCormick, head of currency strategy at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in London. ``At the same time, you&amp;#039;ve got some pretty strong capital inflows to the U.S. We kind of have the perfect circle of fundamentals bumping into strong technicals.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       Europe&amp;#039;s shared currency declined 2 percent to $1.5010 at 3:33 p.m. in New York and reached $1.499, the lowest level since Feb. 26, from $1.5325 yesterday. It fell as much as 2.13 percent, the biggest one-day drop since Sept. 6, 2000, the largest decline since the 1999 introduction of the euro.       The euro&amp;#039;s decline below $1.53 and the  break of the 200-day moving average  at $1.5226 ``marks a significant change in sentiment for the dollar,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; pointing to a further decline to $1.46, Kevin Edgeley, a London-based technical analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a report today. It was the first time the euro fell below the 200-day moving average since 2006.       Since reaching a record high of $1.6038 on July 15, the euro has dropped 6.5 percent. The so-called trading envelopes, which measure how far from the mean a price has strayed, show the euro&amp;#039;s decline has doubled the typical changes versus the dollar in the past 20 days.       ``The most important aspect of the dramatic collapse in the euro dollar is the absence of confirmation from other markets,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said David Woo, global head of currency strategy at Barclays Capital Inc. in London. ``None of the typical drivers of the euro-dollar in the past couple of years could have accounted for the magnitude of this move, which leads one to conclude that this is a technical-driven move. From that point of view, we do not think that this move is sustainable.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;          The European currency has declined 3.6 percent against the dollar in its fourth weekly decline, the worst losing streak since May 2007. Against the yen, the U.S. currency has advanced 2.3 percent, heading for its biggest weekly gain in almost two months.
