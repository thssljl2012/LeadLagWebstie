       UPDATE 5-Weak demand expected to undermine copper Wed Aug 6, 2008 12:25pm EDT   http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINL624349520080806?rpc=44    * Copper bounces as commodity prices steady   * Rising stocks, weak demand cap copper price gains   * Aluminium supplies seen exceeding demand  (Rewrites throughout, adds comment/detail, closing prices)   By Julie Crust and Pratima Desai   LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Copper steadied on Wednesday, but analysts expect prices to be undermined by rising stocks and fears of falling demand as the global economy slows.   Copper for delivery in three months MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange closed at $7,615 a tonne from $7,620/7,625 on Tuesday when it touched a 6-month low of $7,530.   Inventories of the metal, used in power and construction, rose 1,575 tonnes to 150,325, the highest level since Feb 14 and a gain of of nearly 28,000 tonnes since early July.   &amp;amp;quot;Commodity markets are a little bit steadier. That&amp;#039;s helped put a floor under most of the base metals,&amp;amp;quot; said John Kemp, economist at RBS Sempra.   &amp;amp;quot;Otherwise the outlook hasn&amp;#039;t changed very much, the global economy is still slowing, which will cap upside potential.&amp;amp;quot;   However, despite expectations of weaker demand, investors are reluctant to short -- sell a a security on the expectation of buying it back cheaper at a later date -- metals.   In the case of copper that is mainly because many think copper prices, down nearly 15 percent since hitting a record high of of $8,940 a tonne on July 2, have fallen far enough.   Much of that is because of weak demand from China, the world&amp;#039;s top copper consumer.   &amp;amp;quot;The differences between prices in Shanghai and here are narrowing,&amp;amp;quot; a trader said.   More available material can be seen in the backwardation or premium for cash material over the three-month contract, which has fallen to around $150 a tonne from around $240 mid-July.   DIVIDED OPINIONS   Energy-intensive aluminium, down about 14 percent since an all-time high of $3,380 a tonne seen on July 10 has tracked losses in crude oil CLc1, trading near 3-month lows.    Aluminium MAL3 ended at $2,906 a tonne from $2,900 at the close on Tuesday.   Opinion about aluminium&amp;#039;s price prospects is divided.   Many think power shortages in top producer China will curb output in the country which is also the world&amp;#039;s top consumer of the metal used in packaging, power and transport.   Many are worried that planned capacity in the Middle East could be scuppered by gas supplies. [ID:nL6364616]   Others expect an oversupply in the short-term.   &amp;amp;quot;With oil having since fallen back, concerns about Chinese smelter disruptions easing and stocks remaining at very high levels, aluminium prices have retreated sharply again,&amp;amp;quot; Standard Bank said in a note.   &amp;amp;quot;There is little risk of any nearby shortage in this market, so our near-term view is neutral to bearish.&amp;amp;quot;   Also bearish is the outlook for zinc MZN3, last at $1,765 a tonne from $1,746 on Tuesday when it fell to $1,730, its lowest since November 2005.   Stocks at around 165,000 tonnes, the highest level since September 2006 have weighed on prices, traders said.   &amp;amp;quot;We expect further weakness ahead in zinc prices on the back of the oversupply,&amp;amp;quot; Barclays Capital said in a note.   However world zinc prices are likely to recover next year thanks to a looming supply shortfall, the world No. 2 zinc miner Oz Minerals Ltd (OZL.AX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) said. [ID:nSYD26337]   Nickel MNI3 was untraded at the close, but bid at $17,800 a tonne. Earlier the metal, used to make stainless steel, fell to $17,370 a tonne, its lowest level since June 2006.   Tin MNI3 was bid higher at $20,450 a tonne from $20,100 and lead MPB3 traded up at $2,065 a tonne from $2,015.
