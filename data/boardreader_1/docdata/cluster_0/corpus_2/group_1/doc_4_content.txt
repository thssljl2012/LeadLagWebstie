    Oil prices resumed their descent Friday, dropping below $117 a barrel as a strengthening dollar and expectations of slowing demand offset supply concerns over a sabotaged pipeline in Turkey.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;quot;The dollar is a factor, but the dominant factor is the perception that high oil prices coupled with slower economic growth in developed countries will curb oil demand,&amp;quot; said David Moore, a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  in Sydney. &amp;quot;Oil prices are still at very high historical levels.&amp;quot;   &amp;amp;nbsp;    So,  lower demand continues to drive down gasoline prices .&amp;amp;nbsp; Yet, McCain and the right continue to falesly demogogue that Obama &amp;#039;does not have a plan to lower gas prices,&amp;#039; despite his plan to lower demand,&amp;amp;nbsp;despite the fact that lowering demand&amp;amp;nbsp;has obviously worked to lower gasoline prices.      &amp;amp;nbsp;    Once again, McCain has missed every single vote on energy for the past 2 sessions of the Senate, so he has done nothing at all on the issue of lowering gasoline prices for 2 years, other than to claim that drilling would somehow work, despite also denying that drilling will lower gas prices.
