Both experiences have been unpleasant recently.      But during the next few months, some analysts are predicting investors will see more relief at the pump than in their popular oil stocks and funds.      With Americans cutting back on car and airplane trips, and recessionary pressures stifling demand for oil here and abroad, some analysts say oil could drop to $90 or $100 a barrel and remain under the record high of more than $147 a barrel for a couple of years. While that would feel better at the pump, where prices already have dropped about 10 cents from a national high of $4.11 a gallon, it could be unnerving to investors.                         In particular, investors who were sucked into buying oil stocks and funds during the early summer hysteria might wonder what happened to the 24-hour-a-day flap about ever-rising oil prices and supply shortages.      In just a month, the price of crude has dropped about 16 percent since the peak. The energy stocks of the Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s 500 have lost more than 14 percent. The integrated oil and gas Dow Jones index is down more than 20 percent.       If oil prices continue to slide, oil stocks will, too, because about 80 percent of the price is tied to the commodity, said senior energy analyst Charles Maxwell of Weeden &amp;amp;amp; Co. Maxwell is predicting that oil could drop to $90 and trade between that and $130 into 2010. By 2015, however, he predicts oil at $300 a barrel.      He still believes that oil supplies cannot match demand longer term, but current economic weakness relieves the immediate effect.      &amp;quot;We will have a serious and long recession because banks can&amp;#039;t lend large amounts of money. Through 2009 and into 2010 that will take the starch out of our economy and cut our imports. We will export our recession,&amp;quot; he said. He expects worldwide oil demand to increase just a tenth of a percent a year.      Already, investors are picking up the signals. Barclays&amp;#039; energy research team has estimated that total U.S. demand for oil has fallen by about 3.8 percent this year as people and businesses cut back energy use to avoid high prices.      Economists note that the world&amp;#039;s economy has not held up the way many expected just months ago.      &amp;quot;Manufacturing production in both the Eurozone and Japan declined last quarter,&amp;quot; Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg said in a recent report. &amp;quot;In Europe, Spain, Ireland and Denmark are either already in recession or are on the precipice thereof. ... Italy is stagnating and France is weakening. Resilient export-oriented Germany has also begun to falter, and the UK--coming off its steepest increase in unemployment in 16 years and deepening decline in home prices, looks to be no fewer than six months behind the USA on the road to recession.&amp;quot;    Citigroup    strategist Tobias Levkovich has warned investors not to confuse the latest pullback in energy and commodity prices with short-lived downturns in January and March.      &amp;quot;They were sentiment-based, but economic conditions were solid,&amp;quot; he said in a report. The differences now include &amp;quot;a slumping U.S., industrial activity, weaker earnings guidance, news of European economic woes and stretched oil prices.&amp;quot; Levkovich and other analysts still say they agree with the argument that was broadcast around the clock earlier this summer--that areas such as China and India will continue their growth spurts and a continually developing world will gulp petroleum at a point when oil supplies can&amp;#039;t keep up.       But Levkovich tells investors not to mistake the long-term trend with what&amp;#039;s happening now: &amp;quot;Global growth does not mean that business cycles have ended.&amp;quot; Despite the economic slowdown, however,    Goldman Sachs    energy analysts continue to predict that crude oil will go to $149 a barrel by the end of this year. And the analysts get investors&amp;#039; attention when they speak: In 2005, Goldman was among the early firms to predict that oil would soar. When prices were merely at $50, Goldman suggested supply constraints and a fast-developing globe would cause prices to go above $100 a barrel.      Such predictions seemed preposterous then, but almost a sweet memory now.      Rather than waiting for a further decline in oil prices, Goldman strategist David Kostin is suggesting investors use the recent pullback to buy exploration and production companies    EOG Resources   ,    Cabot Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas   , Apache, and    Anadarko Petroleum   . He also likes integrated companies Hess and    ConocoPhillips   .      Maxwell, on the other hand, said investors will have a tremendous opportunity to buy stocks when oil prices fall closer to $90. He suggests deep water drillers Transocean,    Diamond Offshore Drilling    and    Pride International   .&amp;amp;lt;
