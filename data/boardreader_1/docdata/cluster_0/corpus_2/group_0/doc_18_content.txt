    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Oil and aluminium retreat from record highs(+other minerals)   Oil and aluminium retreat from record highs  By Chris Flood  FTimes: July 14 2008 19:22    Oil and aluminium prices eased on Monday, having reached record levels last week, as commodity markets staged a broad-based retreat, under pressure from a recovery in the dollar.    ICE August Brent fell 49 cents to $144.00 a barrel after hitting a record $147.50 on Friday, while Nymex August West Texas Intermediate lost 28 cents at $144.80 a barrel after reaching a peak of $147.27 on Friday.    The supply concerns and geopolitical tensions that had forced a sharp rebound for the oil market last week rumbled on. Traders were keeping an eye on developments in Brazil and a threatened strike by workers at Petrobras that could potentially shut 80 per cent of Brazils 1.8m barrels a day of production.    Meanwhile, Hugo Chvez, president of Venezuela, claimed oil prices could move towards $300 a barrel if ExxonMobil won judicial approval to freeze assets held by PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company.    Amid continuing debate among US lawmakers about the influence of speculators on oil prices, the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that hedge funds had cut back heavily their net long position in crude, down by 67.8 per cent to just over 7,000 lots  the lowest level since February 2007.    The CFTC data also showed hedge funds had reduced their bets on petrol and heating oil prices rising in the week to July 8 when WTI reached $136.04 a barrel.    Among the base metals, aluminium retreated 1.2 per cent to $3,276 a tonne  having hit a record $3,375 last week  after China, the worlds biggest producer, ordered smelters to reduce production because of increasingly serious power supply problems across the country.    Chinas top 20 aluminium producers have agreed to cut output by as much as 10 per cent, potentially pushing the market into a supply deficit this year and beyond.    Traders are asking if the power shortages in China could spread to affect the output of other base metals, such as zinc and lead.    Over the weekend, a group of 27 small and medium-sized lead and zinc smelters in China agreed to cut production by 10 per cent, because of low prices.    Gayle Berry of Barclays Capital said: Unlike last weeks aluminium smelter cutbacks, the zinc cutbacks are not a precursor to forced output reductions due to power shortages, but instead are an effort to raise domestic prices.    Barclays also said that the fragmented structure of Chinas zinc industry would make it difficult to implement the production cuts and that the support for zinc prices would only be short-term.    Zinc slipped 1 per cent to $2,005 a tonne after rallying by 14 per cent last week.    Lead prices which rose 25 per cent last week added 0.5 per cent at $1,975 a tonne, supported by a large fall of 3,200 tonnes in London Metal Exchange stocks.    Barclays said the Chinese production cuts should prove price supportive as output in China had failed to grow at all this year while lead consumption was continuing to expand at a healthy pace.    Copper firmed 0.2 per cent at $8,250 a tonne, supported by further potential supply disruption in Peru where workers at Freeport-McMorans Cerro Verde mine have said they will go on strike on Wednesday.    Nickel fell 3.5 per cent to $20,850 a tonne, but tin bucked the weakness elsewhere in the base metals sector and added 2.6 per cent at $23,500 a tonne.
