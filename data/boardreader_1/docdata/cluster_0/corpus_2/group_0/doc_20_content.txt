  Just saw this while checking me Yahoo e-mail....          House panel told curbing speculation could cut prices                                                                     Near-record oil prices could quickly fall by half if Congress were to rein in speculators, according to testimony Monday from a hedge fund manager and oil company adviser on Capitol Hill.      Michael Masters, of Masters Capital Management, told a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that - with greater regulation - oil prices could drop to $65 or $70 a barrel within about 30 days.      &amp;amp;quot;That&amp;#039;s half of where prices are today, and gas prices would reflect that,&amp;amp;quot; he said.                                                                                                                  &amp;amp;quot;If it is a bubble, then where is the evidence in the actual physical market?&amp;amp;quot; asked Kevin Norrish, a commodities analyst with Barclays Capital in London. &amp;amp;quot;There is an endless list of reasons why this argument is a very, very poor one - it will only make things worse.&amp;amp;quot;                                                  http://biz.yahoo.com/cnnm/080623/062...tion.html?.v=4
