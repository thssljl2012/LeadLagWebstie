the love of choking on the euro...good show  juan-clade..        July 11 (Bloomberg) -- The euro-region&amp;#039;s economy  probably contracted in the second quarter for the  first time since the single currency was set up  almost a decade ago, said economists at Citigroup  Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. and Barclays Capital.          The 15-nation economy is buckling as record oil  prices, a stronger euro and a global slowdown take  their toll on growth, data showed this week. Exports  and industrial output fell in May in Germany and  France, while companies including Heidelberger  Druckmaschinen AG and Renault SA said they&amp;#039;re cutting  jobs or sales targets.          While Europe may still avoid its first outright  recession in 15 years, further pain may be on the way  for consumers and executives. European Central Bank  President Jean-Claude Trichet is refusing to give up  the bank&amp;#039;s fight against the worst bout of inflation  in a generation and raised interest rates last week  just as a housing-market slump worsens in parts of  the euro- area.          ``The ECB will get its way on inflation, but at the  cost of the economy slowing to the brink of recession  or worse,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Julian Callow, chief European  economist at Barclays Capital in London. He estimates  the economy shrank 0.1 percent in the last quarter  and will expand 0.3 percent in each of the following  three-month periods. It expanded 2.7 percent last  year.            http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2...
