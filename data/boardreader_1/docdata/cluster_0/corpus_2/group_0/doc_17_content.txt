    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              SemGroup a small factor in oil price drop -experts      By Matthew Robinson and Robert Campbell    NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - SemGroup&amp;#039;s collapse from the 12th biggest U.S. private firm into bankruptcy was only a small factor in the $23 per barrel drop from oil&amp;#039;s record high over the past two weeks, energy experts said on Thursday.    The Tulsa-based company declared bankruptcy this week after racking up $2.4 billion in losses shorting crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, including a $290 million loss owed to SemGroup by a trading firm affiliated with former Chief Executive and co-founder Thomas Kivisto.    Traders and analysts said that while the unwinding of the company&amp;#039;s positions added to the drop that sent oil prices from a record over $147 a barrel to $124 early Thursday, wider factors including slackening demand in the United States and other big consumers and the firming dollar.    &amp;quot;Of the $23 that has been lopped off, actually $17 dollars of that sell-off is actually directly relat ed to the strengthening of the dollar, the (rest) is the change in the fundamentals,&amp;quot; said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA.    &amp;quot;SemGroup, of course they were part of it because they had to liquidate big positions, but $23 -- I don&amp;#039;t think so.&amp;quot;    Roaring demand in Asian economies like China sent crude up sevenfold at its peak as part of six-year commodities rally. Further support came from a surge in cash from investors seeking to hedge against the weak dollar, rising inflation and struggling bank stocks.    But with demand beginning to buckle, the dollar and financials improving, investors have begun to unwind their trades, pushing crude lower since the record on July 11.    &amp;quot;I think that to some extent there has been the beginnings of a shift in sentiment regarding demand,&amp;quot; said Addison Armstrong, director of market research for Tradition Energy, &amp;quot;This sell-off has been about liquidation.&amp;quot;    SemGroup only disclosed its l iquidity problems to lenders on July 15, sources familiar with the call said this week. The next day Bank of America , SemGroup&amp;#039;s main bank lender, issued a default notice on $2.55 billion of its secured debt.    The July 16 default notice forced SemGroup to transfer its NYMEX position to Barclays that same day and recognize a $2.4 billion loss. Barclays did not retain the position and has no significant exposure to SemGroup, according to a source close to the bank.    A Barclays spokesman declined comment.
