Barclays warns of a financial storm as Federal  Reserve&amp;#039;s credibility  crumbles        Last Updated: 12:01am BST  28/06/2008        US central bank accused of unleashing an inflation  shock that will rock financial markets, reports  Ambrose Evans-Pritchard          Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down  the hatches for a worldwide financial storm, warning  that the US Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation  genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall  &amp;amp;quot;below zero&amp;amp;quot;.          &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re in a nasty environment,&amp;amp;quot; said Tim Bond, the  bank&amp;#039;s chief equity strategist. &amp;amp;quot;There is an  inflation shock underway. This is going to be very  negative for financial assets. We are going into  tortoise mood and are retreating into our shell.  Investors will do well if they can preserve their  wealth.&amp;amp;quot;          Barclays Capital said in its closely-watched Global  Outlook that US headline inflation would hit 5.5pc by  August and the Fed will have to raise interest rates  six times by the end of next year to prevent a  wage-spiral. If it hesitates, the bond markets will  take matters into their own hands. &amp;amp;quot;This is the first  test for central banks in 30 years and they have  fluffed it. They have zero credibility, and the Fed  is negative if that&amp;#039;s possible. It has lost all  credibility,&amp;amp;quot; said Mr Bond.          The grim verdict on Ben Bernanke&amp;#039;s Fed was  underscored by the markets yesterday as the dollar  fell against the euro following the bank&amp;#039;s dovish  policy statement on Wednesday.          Traders said the Fed seemed to be rowing back from  rate rises. The effect was to propel oil to $138 a  barrel, confirming its role as a sort of  &amp;amp;quot;anti-dollar&amp;amp;quot; and as a market reproach to  Washington&amp;#039;s easy-money  policies.        The Fed&amp;#039;s stimulus is being transmitted to the  45-odd countries linked to the dollar around world.  The result is surging commodity prices. Global  inflation has jumped from 3.2pc to 5pc over the last  year.          Mr Bond said the emerging world is now on the cusp  of a serious crisis. &amp;amp;quot;Inflation is out of control in  Asia. Vietnam has already blown up. The policy  response is to shoot the messenger, like the  developed central banks in the late 1960s and 1970s,&amp;amp;quot;  he  said.        &amp;amp;quot;They will have to slam on the brakes. There is  going to be a deep global recession over the next  three years as policy-makers try to get inflation  back in the  box.&amp;amp;quot;        Barclays Capital recommends outright &amp;amp;quot;short&amp;amp;quot;  positions on Asian bonds, warning that yields could  jump 200 to 300 basis points. The currencies of  trade-deficit states like India should be sold. The  US yield curve is likely to &amp;amp;quot;steepen&amp;amp;quot; with a  vengeance, causing a bloodbath for bond  holders.        David Woo, the bank&amp;#039;s currency chief, said the Fed&amp;#039;s  policy of benign neglect towards the dollar had been  stymied by oil, which is now eating deep into the  country&amp;#039;s standard of living. &amp;amp;quot;The world has changed  all of a sudden. The market is going to push the Fed  into a tightening stance,&amp;amp;quot; he  said.        continued
