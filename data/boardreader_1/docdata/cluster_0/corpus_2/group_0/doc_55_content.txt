Sayson  &amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;gt; July 29 (Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks fell to the lowest in more than a  &amp;amp;gt; week after forecasts from Toyota Motor Corp. and Singapore Airlines  &amp;amp;gt; Ltd. deepened concern that slowing economic growth and higher energy  &amp;amp;gt; costs will hurt earnings.  &amp;amp;gt; Toyota retreated as record U.S. gasoline prices eroded overseas sales,  &amp;amp;gt; Japan&amp;#039;s jobless rate rose to the highest in almost two years in June  &amp;amp;gt; and household spending fell. Singapore Air, the world&amp;#039;s second-biggest  &amp;amp;gt; carrier by market value, dropped for a third day. Commonwealth Bank of  &amp;amp;gt; Australia led financial companies lower after the International  &amp;amp;gt; Monetary Fund said there is no end in sight to the U.S. housing  &amp;amp;gt; recession.  &amp;amp;gt; ``Things could get ugly,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Jonathan Ravelas, a strategist at  &amp;amp;gt; Manila-based Banco de Oro Unibank Inc., which manages about $5.9  &amp;amp;gt; billion in assets. ``The recent developments highlight that the  &amp;amp;gt; situation in the U.S. is far from over. We could see more downside  &amp;amp;gt; from here as corporate earnings are released.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  &amp;amp;gt; The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 2.2 percent to 130.10 as of 12:33  &amp;amp;gt; a.m. in Tokyo, set to close at the lowest since July 18. About 16  &amp;amp;gt; stocks retreated for each that rose. Financial stocks accounted for a  &amp;amp;gt; third of the index&amp;#039;s decline.  &amp;amp;gt; Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 2.2 percent to 13,058.74.  &amp;amp;gt; Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Kansai Electric Power Co., Japan&amp;#039;s  &amp;amp;gt; biggest utility companies, declined after forecasting losses due to  &amp;amp;gt; higher energy costs.

Futures on the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 were little  &amp;amp;gt; changed today.  &amp;amp;gt; MSCI&amp;#039;s benchmark index for Asia has slumped 25 percent from its Nov. 1  &amp;amp;gt; record as financial institutions worldwide suffered $468.5 billion in  &amp;amp;gt; writedowns and credit losses stemming from the collapse of the  &amp;amp;gt; subprime mortgage market.  &amp;amp;gt; ``At the moment, a bottom for the housing market is not visible,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; the  &amp;amp;gt; IMF said in its Global Financial Stability Report, released yesterday  &amp;amp;gt; in Washington. ``Stemming the decline in the U.S. housing market is  &amp;amp;gt; necessary for market stabilization.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  &amp;amp;gt; Toyota sank for a third day, declining 3.5 percent to 4,710 yen. The  &amp;amp;gt; company cut its forecast for worldwide vehicle sales this year by  &amp;amp;gt; 350,000 units to 9.5 million, as record U.S. gasoline prices erode  &amp;amp;gt; sales of trucks and sport-utility vehicles.  &amp;amp;gt; Honda Motor Co., Japan&amp;#039;s second-largest automaker, declined 3.8  &amp;amp;gt; percent to 3,510 yen. The company lowered its full-year operating  &amp;amp;gt; profit forecast last week.  &amp;amp;gt; Lowered Forecasts  &amp;amp;gt; ``Investors have no way of seeing how deep this global economic  &amp;amp;gt; downturn is going to take us,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Mamoru Shimode, Tokyo- based chief  &amp;amp;gt; equity strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, said in an interview with  &amp;amp;gt; Bloomberg Television.  &amp;amp;gt; Singapore Air dropped 1.6 percent to S$15.04, after first- quarter  &amp;amp;gt; profit fell 15 percent to S$358.6 million ($263 million) after the  &amp;amp;gt; price of jet kerosene almost doubled in the past year. Operating  &amp;amp;gt; profit margins will narrow due to higher fuel costs, Chief Executive  &amp;amp;gt; Officer Chew Choon Seng said today.  &amp;amp;gt; Thai Airways International Pcl lost 3 percent to 16.3 baht. The  &amp;amp;gt; carrier recorded a 4.18 billion baht ($125 million) loss in the second  &amp;amp;gt; quarter as fuel costs surged, the Krungthep Turakij newspaper  &amp;amp;gt; reported, citing an unidentified company official.  &amp;amp;gt; Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation&amp;#039;s largest lender, sank 4.6  &amp;amp;gt; percent to A$39.20.

A planned  &amp;amp;gt; A$850 million ($814 million) bond sale was cut to A$260 million after  &amp;amp;gt; some investors pulled out, the bank said.  &amp;amp;gt; Financial stocks also fell after Merrill Lynch &amp;amp;amp; Co. took steps to  &amp;amp;gt; preserve its credit rating by selling $8.5 billion of stock and  &amp;amp;gt; liquidating $30.6 billion of money-losing assets at a fifth of their  &amp;amp;gt; original value. Merrill said it will book $5.7 billion of additional  &amp;amp;gt; writedowns on collateralized debt obligations and associated hedges.  &amp;amp;gt; Tokyo Electric fell 1.2 percent to 2,780 yen, after forecasting its  &amp;amp;gt; loss may widen to a record 280 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in the year  &amp;amp;gt; ending March 31, from a 150 billion yen loss a year earlier, after the  &amp;amp;gt; shutdown of the world&amp;#039;s largest nuclear plant forced it to burn  &amp;amp;gt; costlier oil and gas.  &amp;amp;gt; Kansai Electric declined 2.5 percent to 2,360 yen, the most since June  &amp;amp;gt; 19. The company said it may post a full-year loss of 55 billion yen,  &amp;amp;gt; compared to its April 30 forecast for a 69 billion profit.  &amp;amp;gt; DeNA Co., a Japanese auction and shopping Web site operator, slumped  &amp;amp;gt; by the daily limit of 14 percent to 590,000 yen in Tokyo, the biggest  &amp;amp;gt; percentage decline on MSCI&amp;#039;s Asian gauge.
