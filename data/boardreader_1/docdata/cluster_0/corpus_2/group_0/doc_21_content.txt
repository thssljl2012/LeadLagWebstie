LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The euro remained well bid following hawkish comments from European Central Bank governing council member Nout Wellink.    Wellink told Elsevier magazine that a slower economy will not reduce inflation, and said that experiences in the 1970s showed if you did not act early to contain inflation it could persist for the long term.    &amp;#039;It&amp;#039;s a mistake to think that inflation will fall if the economy weakens....We have seen that too in the 70s,&amp;#039; he said.    In addition a report in the Financial Times that some of the world&amp;#039;s largest sovereign wealth funds are diversifying out of their dollar-denominated assets has also given support to the single currency against the greenback.    The FT said one major fund in the Gulf has cut its dollar-denominated holdings from more than 80 percent to less than 60 percent over the past year.    &amp;#039;If today&amp;#039;s article in the FT is to be believed, then there is little question of downward pressure upon the dollar abating any time soon,&amp;#039; said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon, though he added that political worries about a weak dollar may counter this.    Now attention is turning to the U.S. markets open to see whether this is yet another bout of volatility to provide the dollar with some direction.    A major rally on equity markets Wednesday, driven by strong corporate earnings reports, a falling oil price and punchy U.S. inflation figures helped the dollar post significant gains. But these have proved shortlived as investors remain uncertain about the future of government sponsored mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (GSEs).    &amp;#039;The question remains whether the furore surrounding GSEs and an expected reluctance to load up on corporate debt will lead to funding problems that today&amp;#039;s lower dollar is already signalling?&amp;#039; said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at Commerzbank.    Also due are the weekly U.S. jobless claim and housing start figures.    The pound was hovering around the $2.00 mark, steadying after sliding on Wednesday on figures showing the UK claimant count rose at its fastest rate for 16 years during June.    With no major UK data due on Thursday focus is likely to be on the deadline for banking giant Barclays&amp;#039; $4.5 billion rights issue.    &amp;#039;Should financials rebound further today, rights issues will look attractive    again suggesting a successful refunding of the institution,&amp;#039; said analysts at BNP Paribas.    &amp;#039;Hence, the equity market performance today might have a bigger impact on sterling than usual,&amp;#039; they added.
