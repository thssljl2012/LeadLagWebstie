 the supply side always seems to underperform the predictions of the experts, but demand seems to keep moving higher  during the 25 yr down cycle for mining, there was lots of copper around so supply side problems went unnoticed, now during our current commodities super-cycle there is no copper available so every supply side problem becomes a &amp;#039;serious&amp;#039; problem, itll probably only get worse forthe next 10 yrs cause we should be getting closer to the time when the big old mines start depleting and there arent anybig new mines being built to replace them (yet)  ******************************************************  Disruptions wipe out expected copper surplus in &amp;#039;08   By: Reuters  Published on 22nd July 2008  Updated 6 hours ago     Sluggish copper mine output and disruptions in Latin America have wiped out an expected surplus this year,   while energy supply problems have cut a predicted aluminium surplus, a Reuters survey showed.   The poll of 22 commodity analysts around the world carried out over the past month shows the 41-million-ton per year aluminium market in a slight surplus of 148 500 tons in 2008 compared with 325 000 in the January survey.   In 2009, the market is seen with a larger-than-expected deficit of 144 500 due to power problems.   The copper market is seen in a deficit of 68 000 tons this year versus an expected surplus of 160 000 January.   &amp;quot;Supply has clearly underperformed against the markets&amp;#039; forecast -- it has been a difficult year or two in Latin America,&amp;quot; said analyst Daniel Hynes at Merrill Lynch.   A strike in Peru, the world&amp;#039;s second largest copper producer, took futures prices to a record $8,940 a tonne in July.   Strikes have also hit the world&amp;#039;s number one producer Chile.   &amp;quot;We did see a cut in production from China as well,&amp;quot; Hynes said, adding that concentrate - raw material for copper production - was tight.     Falling ore grades, delays in bringing new projects online, rising capital expenditure and labour unrest would persistently keep the raw materials market tight, analysts said.       &amp;quot;Poor performance relative to expectations is nothing new for copper supply over the past few years, but global mine production is now falling in absolute terms,&amp;quot; said Gayle Berry at Barclays Capital.     In 2009, the copper market was seen moving into a surplus of 141 825 tons, lower than the 154 000 surplus predicted in the January poll.   The market was in a deficit of 42 000 tons last year, against a surplus of 287 000 in 2006, according to figures from the International Copper Study Group.
