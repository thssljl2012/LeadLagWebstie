- Leading indicators hint that Australia&amp;#039;s economy will continue to slow down: (AU MAY WESTPAC LEADING INDEX MOM: 0.0% V 0.4% prior) &amp;amp;quot;This result is entirely consistent with the prospect that the Australian economy can be expected to slow further through 2008 and into 2009,&amp;amp;quot; Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans said. Over the last six months, Evans said, the growth rate of the leading index has fallen to 2.1% from 6.5%, the sharpest six month decline since February 2001.    - Japan&amp;#039;s services sector contracts in May: (JP MAY TERTIARY INDUSTRY INDEX MOM: -0.2% V 0.2% expected, 1.9% prior) &amp;amp;quot;The decline in the tertiary index means &amp;amp;quot;growth in Japan&amp;#039;s service sectors has ended due to weak domestic demand,&amp;amp;quot; Norio Miyagawa, an economist at Shinko Research Institute told Dow Jones. &amp;amp;quot;If business activities, such as capital spending and consumer spending weaken further, Japan&amp;#039;s service sectors will face a significant downturn.&amp;amp;quot;    - According to various press reports, the Bush administration is sending the State Department&amp;#039;s No. 3 diplomat to Switzerland to meet Iran&amp;#039;s top arms negotiator this weekend. This will be the closest contact between the two countries since the Iranian revolution of 1979, but oil markets showed no reaction to the news. A U.S. official said Tehran may be willing to agree to a &amp;amp;quot;freeze-for-freeze&amp;amp;quot; agreement, which would call for the Security Council stopping efforts to impose new sanctions on Iran.   - Glen Stevens, the Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s governor, reiterated that he sees clear evidence that demand is slowing. &amp;amp;quot;Containing and reducing inflation over time will mean that we should be able, at some point, to look back to the current period as one of higher than normal interest rates,&amp;amp;quot; he said. Analysts said the speech added weight to the view that Australian interest rates will remain on hold over the coming months.   - Equities: At 23:56 EDT Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei is -0.16%, the S&amp;amp;amp;P/ASX200 is +1.19%, South Korea&amp;#039;s KOSPI is -0.96%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng index is -0.38% and the Shanghai composite index is -2.39%.

The S&amp;amp;amp;P/ASX200 recovered from yesterday&amp;#039;s wave of selling, with retailers tracking Woolworth&amp;#039;s bullish earnings results. Aussie banks traded higher after Westpac announced plans to increase variable mortgage rates by 14bps, but most traders attribute the price action to short-covering.
