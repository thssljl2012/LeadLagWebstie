U.S. crude rose 39 cents to $140.39 a barrel by 0201 GMT, while London Brent crude rose 76 cents to $140.59.

In a war of words between the Iranian and U.S. military, Iran&amp;#039;s Revolutionary Guard said Tehran would impose controls on shipping in the Middle East Gulf and Strait of Hormuz if it were attacked.

The revision, which showed April demand was the lowest for the month since April 2002, came even before gasoline prices surged to new records in June.&amp;quot;   Back to 2002 usage levels?  With a larger population and economy?  More of that trend, please.  1950 here I come!                       ...
