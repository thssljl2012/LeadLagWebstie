 INTEREST RATES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PRETTY BLUNT INSTRUMENT.  The reserve bank has effectively gutted the economy.  They are always too late to the party.  They should never have let it get out of control in the first place.  Some very valuable and fornicateing painful lessons are about to be learnt.  Now they are trying to unjawbone the masses??   Signs rates &amp;#039;will stay put for long period&amp;#039;   THE Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) continues to be wary of high inflation, but its acknowledgment that the economy is slowing has dampened expectations of further interest rate rises, economists say.  The minutes of the central bank&amp;#039;s July board meeting, released today, said the RBA expected the June quarter consumer price index to show inflation of &amp;amp;quot;over one per cent&amp;amp;quot; in the quarter.  &amp;amp;quot;Members expected that the CPI for the June quarter, which would be released before the next board meeting, would show another high reading,&amp;amp;quot; the minutes said.  &amp;amp;quot;These high outcomes risked lifting inflationary expectations and/or wage demands.   http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/stor...5001028,00.html
