The Australian stock market plummeted more than 3 per cent after   National Australia Bank took an additional provision of A$830 million   on its exposure to the US credit crisis.      The bank&amp;#039;s shares fell as much as 13 per cent in early trading, and it   is on track to record its worst day of trading in seven years.      The benchmark S&amp;amp;amp;P/ASX200 index fell as much as 3.3 per cent, or 167.2   points, to 4976.9, while the broader All Ordinaries dipped 139.4   points, or 2.69 per cent, to 5049.

St George lost A$1.05, or 3.54 per cent, to A$28.60.      Wall Street fell 2 per cent overnight as a weaker-than-expected report   on the US housing market raised fresh fears about an economic recovery   and ended a rush into banking stocks.      Record losses reported by car maker Ford, forced to step up its   restructuring, also contributed to the negative tone in the market.      The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 283.1 points, or 2.43 per cent,   to close at 11,349.28 and the broader Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s 500 index   retreated 29.65 points, or 2.31 per cent, to 1,252.54.
