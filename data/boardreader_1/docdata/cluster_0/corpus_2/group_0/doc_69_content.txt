Australia Adds Three Times as Many Jobs as                         Expected (Update2)                            By Victoria Batchelor                                                                                                                                         July 10 (Bloomberg) -- Australia added three times as many                            jobs    as economists forecast in                         June as mining companies, led by BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto                         Group, expanded to meet Chinese demand for commodities.                           Employers hired 29,800 workers following May&amp;#039;s 25,600 decline                         that ended a record 18 months of job gains, the statistics bureau                         said in Sydney today. The    jobless rate    fell to 4.2                         percent from 4.3 percent.                           The local currency rose on optimism the nation will weather a                         global slump that has sent New Zealand and the U.K. to the brink of                         recession. Record exports are underpinning Australia&amp;#039;s economy as                         consumers cut spending in the face of the highest interest rates in                         12 years and rising fuel prices.                           ``This is a clear sign the economy still has life in it, buoyed                         by a resources boom,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said    Sally                         Auld   , co-head of economics at Australia &amp;amp;amp; New                         Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Sydney. ``  If it wasn&amp;#039;t for mining, Australia&amp;#039;s economy                         could be in as bad shape as New Zealand and the                         U.K.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;                             The Australian dollar climbed to 96.92 U.S. cents at 1:07 p.m.                         in Sydney from 95.55 cents before the report was released. The                         two-year government bond yield fell to 6.65 percent from 6.69                         percent yesterday.                           The median    estimate    of 25 economists                         surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 10,000 jobs increase in                         June.                           The number of full-time positions increased 24,000 and part-time                         jobs rose 5,800. About half of the nation&amp;#039;s 21 million people are                         employed.                           IMF Report                           The International Monetary Fund said today the strength of the                         mining industry will add to pressure on consumer prices. The fund                         said the central bank should be prepared to raise interest rates                         ``quickly&amp;#039;&amp;#039; if domestic demand doesn&amp;#039;t slow enough.                           The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its    benchmark rate    to 7.25 percent                         in March, the fourth increase since August 2007. Eighteen of 25                         economists surveyed on June 30 said the bank will keep borrowing                         costs unchanged this year as economic growth cools and helps damp                         the fastest inflation since 1991.                           ``Today&amp;#039;s firm employment report underlines it&amp;#039;s premature to be                         talking about interest-rate cuts, but it doesn&amp;#039;t build the case for                         another increase,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said    Matthew                         Johnson   , senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd.                         in Sydney. ``The economy is slowing, so I suspect we&amp;#039;ll see soft                         employment numbers over coming months.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;                           Reports yesterday showed    consumer confidence    slumped in                         July to the lowest level since 1992 and home-loan approvals fell by                         the most in eight years in May. Those figures sent the Australian                         dollar to the lowest level in almost three weeks.                           Rate Expectations                           Traders have assigned 24 percent odds on the Reserve Bank                         raising its benchmark rate by a quarter point in the next 12                         months, according to a Credit Suisse Group index based on trading                         in interest-rate swaps. The probabilities were 28 percent yesterday                         and 72 percent a week ago.                           Prior to the May jobs decline, employers had added extra                            workers    every month from                         October 2006, the longest run of gains since the government began                         publishing monthly figures in 1978. The nation&amp;#039;s    jobless rate    fell to 4 percent                         in February, the lowest in more than three decades.                           Australia, the world&amp;#039;s largest shipper of coal, iron ore and                         wool, may earn 12 percent more this financial year from commodity                         exports than forecast three months earlier because of higher                         prices, the government said on June 23.                              BHP                         Billiton   , the world&amp;#039;s largest mining company,                         approved a $1.9 billion expansion in May of its Worsley alumina                         project in Western Australia. Rio Tinto plans to boost output by 26                         percent at its Queensland Alumina Ltd. refinery.                           Job Cuts                           Some companies are shedding workers to cut expenses.                           Insurance Australia, an auto and home insurer, announced                         yesterday it would cut 600 jobs to help lower annual costs by A$130                         million. The    Sydney-based company    also said                         it will report the first loss in six years and sell businesses in                         the U.K.                           Goodyear Tire &amp;amp;amp; Rubber Co., the U.S.-based tire maker, said                         last month it will close a Melbourne factory and fire 600                         workers.                           The participation rate, which measures the labor force as a                         percentage of the population aged over 15, rose to 65.3 percent in                         June from 65.2 percent in May, today&amp;#039;s report showed.
