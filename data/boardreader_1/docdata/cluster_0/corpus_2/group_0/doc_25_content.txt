    Dollar on back foot again after mixed U.S. data         LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The dollar was back where it started the day after a mixed bag of U.S. data showing  rising jobless claims  alongside  improvements in home starts  and a key snapshot of the manufacturing sector in the Philadelphia area.  As a whole the data could not detract from worries over the outlook for the U.S. economy, which in turn kept the dollar on the back foot.      In data out today, the number of  U.S. first-time claims  filed in the week ending July 12 was revealed to have risen by 18,000 to 366,000. In the previous week, claims fell sharply by 56,000.      Separately,  US housing starts and building permits  rose unexpectedly in June, although this surprise was down a recent change to New York City&amp;#039;s building code.      Also out today,  manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region  rose slightly in July but otherwise continued its recessionary slide, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported today. The Philly Fed index rose to -16.3 in July from -17.1 the previous month.      The   euro   meanwhile stayed well bid after comments from European Central Bank governing council member Nout Wellink.  Wellink told Elsevier magazine that a slower economy will not reduce inflation, and said that experiences in the 1970s showed if you did not act early to contain inflation it could persist for the long term.  &amp;#039;It&amp;#039;s a mistake to think that inflation will fall if the economy weakens....We have seen that too in the 70s,&amp;#039; he said.  In addition, a report in the Financial Times that some of the  world&amp;#039;s largest sovereign wealth funds are diversifying out of their dollar-denominated assets  also gave support to the single currency.  The FT said one major fund in the Gulf has cut its dollar-denominated holdings from more than 80 percent to less than 60 percent over the past year.      &amp;#039;If today&amp;#039;s article in the FT is to be believed, then there is little question of downward pressure upon the dollar abating any time soon,&amp;#039; said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon, though he added that political worries about a weak dollar may counter this.      With no major UK data due on Thursday focus is likely to be on the deadline for banking giant Barclays&amp;#039; $4.5 billion rights issue.
