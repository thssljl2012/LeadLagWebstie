LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The dollar remained close to its fresh all-time low against the euro following a bleak assessment of financial markets from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales figures.    In his semi-annual testimony before the Senate Bank Committee Bernanke said financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress and stressed the Fed&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;top priority&amp;#039; would be to keep financial markets functioning.    Analysts noted that Bernanke placed more emphasis on the downside risks to U.S. economic growth and the trouble in financial markets than inflation, boosting expectations the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates anytime soon.    &amp;#039;Chairman Bernanke&amp;#039;s testimony was relatively dovish compared to recent Fed rhetoric,&amp;#039; said Dean Maki at Barclays Capital.    &amp;#039;It appears he is guiding markets toward an extended period of Fed policy inaction, and suggests that the Fed is likely to be on hold for longer than our current forecast projects,&amp;#039; he added.    Markets were also concerned earlier by figures showing U.S. retail sales rose by just 0.1 percent in June from July, well below expectations for a reading of 0.4 percent.    Analysts warned the modest rise suggests the boost consumers&amp;#039; received from their tax rebate is already starting to fade.    &amp;#039;With confidence at rock bottom, employment shrinking, house prices and stock markets plummeting and prices for food and energy surging, the outlook for consumption in the second half of the year is incredibly grim,&amp;#039; said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics.    This meant the euro remained close to the all-time high of $1.6038 hit this morning as confidence on financial markets continued to plummet after the U.S. government on Sunday announced plans to shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.    Investors are nervous that a Federal Reserve bail-out could add billions of dollars to the U.S. national debt, and lower the country&amp;#039;s credit rating.    Attention will now turn to U.S. and euro zone inflation figures, both due for release tomorrow.    Elsewhere, the pound remained well bid against the dollar, having briefly hit a three-and-a-half month high against the dollar following stronger-than-expected CPI inflation data this morning.    Official figures showed the key annual CPI rate jumping to 3.8 percent in June from 3.3 percent in May, beating forecasts for a more moderate rise to 3.6.    &amp;#039;The punchy headline number is likely to ensure that the pound remains well bid for now,&amp;#039; said Daragh Maher, senior forex strategist at Calyon.    The data has kept in place expectations that the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates before the end of the year while inflation remains well above its 2.0 percent target.    &amp;#039;Inertia appears the most likely monetary policy stance for now,&amp;#039; said Maher.    However fears about slowing growth in the UK economy may flarae up again tomorrow with the release of the latest unemployment figures.
