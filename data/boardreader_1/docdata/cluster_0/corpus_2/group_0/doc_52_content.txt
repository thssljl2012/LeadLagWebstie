        QUOTE (Bardon &amp;amp;#064; Jul 1 2008, 08&amp;amp;#58;54 AM)        Interest rates unchanged for July   The Reserve Bank today decided to leave official interest rates on hold for another month. The Official Cash Rate therefore continues at 7.25%.  The RBA increased interest rates four times during the 2007-08 financial year, leaving Australia with the highest rates in 12 years.  The next Reserve Bank meeting is on 5 August.    Plus ASX plummeting towards 5,000, and now:   Services sector sinks to record low   Australia&amp;#039;s services sector performance has fallen to a record low and contracted for the third successive month as high petrol prices and interest rates stifle consumer and business spending, a report shows.&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;The Australian Industry Group/Commonwealth Bank performance of services index fell 4.3 index points in June to 45.4 points.&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;It is the worst result on record since the series began in February 2003.&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;The number has been below the 50 mark, which separates an expansion from a contraction, since April.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief economist Michael Blythe said interest rates rises and high fuel costs were hurting the services sector.&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;It&amp;#039;s really that combination of very tight financial conditions, as the Reserve Bank has been talking about record high petrol prices,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;The very sharp drops in consumer confidence have impacted on services and produced this softer result.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;Crude oil prices hit a record &amp;amp;#036;US140 a barrel in June, and have since climbed to &amp;amp;#036;US144.&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;Australian Industry Group chief executive Heather Ridout said the weakness in services activity was broad-based.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;The rising price of oil - to above &amp;amp;#036;US140 per barrel - and high interest rates have significantly dented consumer and business confidence with little prospect of a reprieve in sight,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; she said.&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;#039;&amp;#039;The rising price of oil led to the fastest rate of input cost growth since the survey&amp;#039;s inception.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;&amp;amp;#8232;&amp;amp;#8232;Activity expanded in just two of the services sectors in June, down from four in May. &amp;amp;#8232;Significant pressure on discretionary spending contributed to contractions in retail trade, accommodation, cafes and restaurants and personal and recreational services.
