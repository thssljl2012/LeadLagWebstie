      I met a Euro Bond salesman from Barclays today. Apparently the high price of oil is impacting all areas of the economy, but in particular the airline business. His opinion, low cost air travel is now over.  I guess that&amp;#039;s why Easyjet are going to downsize their fleet by 45 aircraft next year.  Trying to find someone within the aviation business who is not gloomy over the future is getting increasingly difficult. Although we all think the &amp;amp;quot;other&amp;amp;quot; guy is gonna fail before &amp;amp;quot;us&amp;amp;quot;.
