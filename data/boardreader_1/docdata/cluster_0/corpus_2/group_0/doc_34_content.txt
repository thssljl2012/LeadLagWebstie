 Perthx, thanks for the comment I agree with your assessment of a basing in prices. In fact, China has curtailed industry and automobile use to clean up the air leading up to the olympics. Perhaps it was anticipation of that event that led to the severe pullback in the metals.  I just wanted to point out that the article referred to a higher local price for lead than the LME. The following quote from http://www.bnamericas.com/story.jsp?sector=8&amp;amp;amp;noticia=441932&amp;amp;amp;idioma=I&amp;amp;amp;source = seems to give further credence to that thought. There was a pullback, but perhaps not as bad for SVM&amp;#039;s market as the LME prices would have suggested.   &amp;quot;We believe China is going to start importing more and more lead given that production in the country is pretty much flat, but consumption is continuing to expand at a healthy pace. And that is a bullish development for international prices,&amp;quot; the analyst noted.     Another indication that the Chinese market has begun to tighten up is the nearly US$800/t premium over LME prices that lead is trading at on Chinese markets, while physical premiums have jumped 80% over the past two weeks.     Barclays believes lead prices will go higher still given that the lead market is &amp;quot;balanced at best.&amp;quot;   Regards,
