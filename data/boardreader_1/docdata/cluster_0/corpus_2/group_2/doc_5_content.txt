 The generally accepted measure, along with a few other bits n pieces, is two successive quarters of negative growth (what a clunky, ugly phrase)      GDP growth -0.8% for the year to date, unemployment up 1.7% on last year&amp;#039;s average.      Be careful out there, folks. Take care of yourselves and each other.            Ireland leads eurozone into recession   Ireland has become the first country in the eurozone to slide into recession as the torrid housing boom of recent years turns into a deep slump.   By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard       The economy shrank by 0.5pc in second quarter following a 0.3pc contraction in the second quarter, according to the statistics office, marking an emphatic end to the stellar years of the Celtic Tiger.      A long list of eurozone states are expected to follow in short order as the oil shock, surging credit costs, and the global downturn all combine to choke growth across the region. Denmark is already in recession, but is not a member of European Monetary Union (EMU).      &amp;amp;quot;Italy will definitely be next, and probably Germany,&amp;amp;quot; said Julian Callow, Europe economist at Barclays Capital.      &amp;amp;quot;Ireland is suffering from a massive reliance on real estate. Construction was 21pc of GDP at the peak last year, which is even worse than Spain (18pc) and far worse than America (11pc) at the height of the bubble,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      House prices have fallen for eighteen months in a row, according to the TSB/ESRI index. They dropped 9.9pc in August year-on-year and show no sign of stabilizing.      The country is now facing harsh austerity measures as the budge deficit threatens to breach the EU limit of 3pc of GDP. The government secured a pay-freeze last week for public sector workers as the country pulls together with impressive unity.      Mr Callow said Ireland had been hit harder than other eurozone states in what amounts a asymmetric shock as a result of its heavy reliance on the Dublin financial centre and trade ties with the Anglo-Saxon world. Banking and financial services make up 9.8pc of GDP, compared to 7.8pc in Britain..      Almost half of Irish exports  or 17pc of GDP  go to the sterling or dollar regions, making Ireland acutely sensitive to the currency effects of the strong euro.      The deepening recession almost certainly kills any chance of a fresh referendum in coming months on the Lisbon Treaty, which Irish voters have already rejected once. Even diehard officials in Brussels now recognize that no Irish government could win a &amp;amp;quot;revote&amp;amp;quot; in the current economic crisis.
