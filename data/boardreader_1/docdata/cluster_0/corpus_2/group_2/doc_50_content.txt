LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) -  Sterling edged higher against the dollar on Tuesday, helped by a touch of profit-taking in the U.S. currency, as traders braced for more UK economic data  expected to show the economy is deteriorating.    Ongoing worries about the UK economy highlighted by weak figures on retail sales and house prices  continued to leave the pound vulnerable after it hit a 2-1/2 year low against the dollar on Monday.    Sterling was supported after the dollar pulled back from a one-year high hit against a basket of currencies earlier in the day, though market participants expect the boost will be short-lived.    &amp;#039;Global FX markets are in a period of selling off risk. Sterling remains a relatively risky asset and it is likely to come under further pressure,&amp;#039; said Paul Robinson, strategist at Barclays Capital.    Sterling rose as high as $1.7632, before pulling back to $1.7565 by 0806 GMT, little changed on the day. Despite the slight rise, the UK currency hovered near $1.7469 hit on Monday for the first time since April 2006.    Against a currency basket of Britain&amp;#039;s major trading partners, the pound was at 88.6, near a 12-year low of 87.9 hit earlier in the month.    The euro was steady against the UK currency at 80.30 pence.    Sterling&amp;#039;s downside pressure remained on Tuesday due to further bad news on the UK economy. The British Retail Consortium reported like-for-like high street sales fell 1.0 percent from a year earlier in August, the third fall in a row [ID:nL898217].    The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors&amp;#039; latest survey meanwhile continued to paint a bleak picture of the UK housing market despite unexpectedly reporting a slight improvement in its house price balance during August [ID:nL2635039].    UK data due at 0830 GMT is expected to show output in the beleaguered UK manufacturing and industrial sectors dropping further in July, which could put the pound back under pressure.    &amp;#039;Weakness in today&amp;#039;s industrial production will send sterling sub $1.75 following the mixed, though still weak domestic data points overnight,&amp;#039; said Sue Trinh at RBC Capital Markets in a research note.    Barclays Capital&amp;#039;s Robinson said, however, the market&amp;#039;s focus remains on whether inflation will soften sufficiently to allow the Bank of England to cut interest rates, rather than on evidence of weak growth in the economy.    Data on Monday gave signs of moderating inflationary pressures as UK factory gate prices fell at their sharpest monthly rate in at least 22 years in August.
