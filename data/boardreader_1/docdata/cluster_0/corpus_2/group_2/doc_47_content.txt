Natural gas for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was              recently down 39.5 cents, or 4.97%, at $7.548 a million British thermal units.              The price fell as low as $7.40/MMBtu, the lowest since Dec. 31, 2007.              The National Hurricane Center downgraded Gustav one notch to a Category 2              hurricane around 9:00 a.m. EDT as the storm headed toward the coast of              Louisiana. The storm made landfall at Cocodrie at about 11 a.m. EDT, the              National Hurricane Center reported.              But even with the U.S. Minerals Management Service reporting 82.3% of gulf              production shut, gas futures continued along their sharp downward path since              early July highs of over $13.50/MMBtu.              The dynamic in the gas market even with Gustav making landfall hasn&amp;#039;t              changed, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy consultancy Ritterbusch and              Associates in Galena, Ill., as traders continue to see strong supplies from              additional production and weaker summer demand from power plants.              Some of the additional downward pressure on prices Monday is coming from              speculative positions bought before the storm that are now being sold off, with              Gustav failing to provide the expected price support, Ritterbusch said.              &amp;quot;This price action today has to be demoralizing to even the most ardent              bulls,&amp;quot; he said.              If storm damage remains limited, the market could lose between 20 billion              cubic feet and 30 billion cubic feet of gas supplies over the next week,              Barclays Capital analysts said in a note to clients Monday.              &amp;quot;That is close to the amount of unexpected extra gas delivered in last week&amp;#039;s              storage report - offsetting penalties that might allow the market to refocus on              events ahead,&amp;quot; they wrote.              But Barclays warned that Gustav still presented a danger to offshore              platforms, pipelines and gas processing facilities.              Besides shutting in offshore facilities, gas processors and pipelines closed              operations over the weekend ahead of the storm.              The operator of the key Henry Hub, the delivery point for all natural gas              futures traded on Nymex, declared force majeure Saturday. Nymex parent CME              Group Inc. (CME) subsequently on Sunday declared force majeure on gas              deliveries for the August and September contracts.
