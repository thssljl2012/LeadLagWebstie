Oil went down to 95$ and will go down further. Barclays which I own shares Thanks God they withrew from buying Lehman last night.                      oil companies still can make huge profits with even lower prices than the 90$/barrel, it is just an overreaction or severe correction in this sector, while you are still vulnerable with airlines sector, highly volatile
