 All leading indicators turning down.      Job ads down as economy slows   September 8, 2008 - 5:07PM    Page 1 of 2   Single Page View    ANZ job ads records biggest monthly fall in 7.5 years(Update) Jobs ANZ Update      SYDNEY, Sept 8 AAP - The number of jobs advertised in Australia fell sharply in August, recording the biggest monthly fall in seven and a half years, as employees kept to the sidelines amid signs that the economy is slowing.      Job ads in major newspaper and on the internet fell by 4.9% to a weekly average of 249,114 ads per week, the latest ANZ job ads survey found.      It was the worst monthly fall since February 2001 and the fourth monthly fall in a row.      ANZ head of Australian economics Warren Hogan said the recent soft trend in the job ads survey is consistent with other indicators showing spending by consumers slowed abruptly in the first half of calendar 2008.      It also points to more interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), following last week&amp;#039;s 25 basis point reduction in the official cash rate to 7%, he added.      Most economists are looking for another rate cut in October, also of 25 basis points.      &amp;amp;quot;If the weakness in job advertisements flows through into rising unemployment in 2009, there will be greater scope for interest rate reductions next year,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Hogan said.      The ANZ survey showed the overall decline in job ads was driven by falls in both internet and newspaper ads.      Newspaper job ads fell by 4% in August, to an average of 15,105 a week and were down 25.8% from a year ago.      South Australia was the sole state to have an increase in newspaper ads, up 2.6% in August.      Newspaper ads fell by 13.3% in the Northern Territory, 7% in Victoria, 6% in Queensland, 3.3% in New South Wales, 2.4% in Western Australia, 2.4% in Tasmania and 1.8% in the ACT.      Internet adds were down 5% in August to an average of 234,099 a week.      In trend terms, newspaper ads were 3.6% lower and internet adds were 1.1 lower in August.      &amp;amp;quot;The weakness in newspaper advertisements has been concentrated in recent months, having declined by 24% since April,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Hogan said.
