TOKYO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the euro but climbed on a sliding yen on Monday after the U.S. government seized control of mortgage companies Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac  to shore up the U.S. housing market and prevent the spread of global financial turbulence.    The yen was the major loser as the move seemed to lessen one major risk to global financial markets and the U.S. economy, reversing last week&amp;#039;s broad surge on a flight to safety.    The takeover on Sunday of the two mortgage giants, which own or guarantee half of the country&amp;#039;s $12 trillion in outstanding home mortgage debt, followed growing concern about the mounting losses at both, undermining the lenders as other sources of home lending have dried up. [ID:nN07479172]    Still, the impact of the rescue package on the U.S. economy may be limited and the outlook for the dollar is unclear after data on Friday showed a jump in the unemployment rate as the economy lost jobs for the eight month in a row, analysts said.    &amp;#039;Much of the dollar&amp;#039;s gains against the yen owes to the Japanese currency retreating against other currencies,&amp;#039; said Takahide Nagasaki, chief forex strategist at Daiwa Securities SMBC.    &amp;#039;The yen&amp;#039;s weakness, and thus the dollar&amp;#039;s strength, is a result of negative sentiment being soothed by the GSE rescue plan.&amp;#039;    Market watchers said the rise in oil and commodities prices on Monday was a sign that investors&amp;#039; appetite for risk had improved slightly on the GSE bailout.    Oil prices rose almost $3 and poked above $119 on Monday , but the jump was also attributed to concern that Hurricane Ike could damage oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. [O/R].    The dollar climbed 0.9 percent to 108.75 yen  after touching 109.05 on EBS.    The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.4401 , off an 11-month low of $1.4197 touched last week.    The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of six currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 78.327 .    YEN HIT    The yen had shot higher and hit a two-year high against the New Zealand dollar and a near five-year high versus sterling last week as intensifying risk aversion led investors to dump leveraged carry trades funded in the Japanese currency.    Now some of that process is reversing, knocking the yen broadly lower while boosting the euro and commodity currencies like the Australian dollar.    &amp;#039;The news was seen as supportive for the U.S. financial sector and this triggered widespread buying back of short yen cross positions,&amp;#039; said Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Danica Hampton.    Japanese Finance Minister Bunmei Ibuki said on Monday the U.S. move would be positive for the global economy. Ibuki also said Paulson would explain the mortgage lenders rescue package to the G7 finance ministers later Monday. [ID:nTKU003057]    The euro jumped to 156.61 yen , up 1.9 percent from late in New York on Friday, and shot as high as 157.02 yen on trading platform EBS in early Asian trade.    The Australian dollar jumped 2.7 percent to 90.31 yen , sharply above a two-year low of 84.98 yen hit last week.    The high yielding New Zealand and Australian currencies recouped some of their recent sharp losses as risk aversion calmed slightly.    The kiwi  jumped 1.9 percent to $0.6813 and the Aussie  gained 1.8 percent to $0.8304.    Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens gave his semi-annual testimony to lawmakers on Monday and left the door open for further interest rate cuts but suggested any easing would be cautious given stubbornly high inflationary pressures. [ID:nSYD331424]    The governor&amp;#039;s comments were a touch less dovish than expected, analysts said. The RBA cut its key cash rate by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent last week, its first easing in seven years.
