       CHINESE DEMAND    http://www.cnbc.com/id/26833954/   China&amp;#039;s copper imports have fallen since the start of the year due to soft demand, rising domestic output and high prices. China&amp;#039;s imports of refined copper fell slightly on the year to 87,168 tonnes in August, and also were down from 88,075 tonnes in July, the General Administration of Customs said on Monday. But China&amp;#039;s implied copper demand rose 1.2 percent in August from July, Reuters calculations show, despite fears of a widespread slowdown due to factory closures for the Olympic games. The discount for Shanghai&amp;#039;s third-month copper futures versus the London benchmark, including China&amp;#039;s 17 percent value-added tax, widened to 2,504 yuan from 1,312 yuan on Friday. The difference flipped into a premium on Sept 9 for the first time since January. &amp;amp;quot;The positive arbitrage between the Shanghai prices and the LME is being taken advantage of,&amp;amp;quot; said Barclays Capital analyst Gayle Berry. &amp;amp;quot;We saw draws in LME stocks last weekend, and then again today. Whether or not that is an indication of a pick up in consumer buying does remain to be seen yet.&amp;amp;quot;
