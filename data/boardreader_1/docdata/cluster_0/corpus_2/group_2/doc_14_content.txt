SYDNEY, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar gained on the euro on Monday as two European banks failed, while steadying against its U.S. counterpart as U.S. lawmakers hammered out the final details of a $700 billion bailout package.    * After a brief early dip, the Aussie clawed back to $0.8311 , to be little changed from Friday.    * The Aussie firmed to 0.5713 euros amid worries over European banks as Fortis and Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley  had to be rescued.    * Analysts emphasised that much uncertainty remains about the U.S. bailout plan, crucially what price it will pay for distressed debt, but relief at its passage might see some pullback from the extreme risk aversion of recent weeks.    * That could help high-yielding currencies like the Aussie dollar, while stripping sovereign bonds of a little of their recent hefty gains.    * Three-year Australian bond futures dipped 0.030 points to 94.670, while the 10-year bond contract eased 0.025 points to 94.375 as the yield curve flattened.    * Bill futures were higher as the turmoil convinced investors the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would have to cut rates when it meets next week to counter the tightening in interbank rates.    * Interbank market remains all but frozen even after the Federal Reserve led other major central banks in a massive round of liquidity injections on Friday.    * Commodity prices were softer. The CRB commodity index  shed 1.21 percent on Friday to 364.57, while gold eased to around $873. Oil dipped $0.59 to $106.31 a barrel.
