TOKYO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up to a one-year peak against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, riding a boost in confidence in the U.S. financial sector after the government seized control of mortgage giants Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac .    The decision by the U.S. government to bail out the lenders was widely hailed as positive step in staving off wider financial and housing market weakness.    The dollar index , a gauge of the greenback&amp;#039;s performance against a basket of six currencies, hit a fresh one-year high of 79.564 on Tuesday. It later pulled back to 79.445, down 0.1 percent on the day.    The dollar also steadied against the euro at around $1.4131, losing momentum after advancing to an 11-month high of $1.4055  on Monday.    But the U.S. currency was on the back foot against the yen, partially due to the yen&amp;#039;s resilience against other currencies such as the euro and sterling.    And while positive for the greenback now, the rescue plan had not been able to fully reverse the larger trend of risk aversion, analysts said.    &amp;#039;The Fannie and Freddie takeover is an open-ended question as far as the foreign exchange market is concerned. There is still confusion,&amp;#039; said Motonari Ogawa, director of currency trading at Barclays Bank.    &amp;#039;It is difficult to embrace the takeover as a fully positive factor. Currencies have momentarily lost their correlation with the oil and equity markets,&amp;#039; he said.    Various cross yen pairs jumped on Monday in a knee-jerk reaction to the Fannie and Freddie rescue news but the yen bounced back.    The euro slipped 0.5 percent to 152.25 yen  after poking above 157.00 yen on Monday, while sterling slipped 0.4 percent to 189.49 yen  after jumping above 195.00 yen on Monday.
