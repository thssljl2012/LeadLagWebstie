The combination of spending $700 billion on soured mortgage-related assets and providing $400 billion to guarantee money-market mutual funds will boost U.S. borrowing as much as $1 trillion, according to Barclays Capital interest-rate strategist Michael Pond in New York. While the rescue may restore investor confidence to battered financial markets, traders will again focus on the twin budget and current-account deficits and negative real U.S. interest rates.  ``As we get to the other side of this, the dollar will get crushed,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said John Taylor, chairman of New York-based International Foreign Exchange Concepts Inc., the world&amp;#039;s biggest currency hedge-fund firm, which manages about $15 billion.  The dollar fell against 14 of the world&amp;#039;s most-traded currencies on Sept. 19, including the euro, as Paulson unveiled the plan, while the Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s 500 Index rose 4 percent. The plan may end the rally that began in June and drove the U.S. currency up 10 percent versus the euro, 2 percent against the yen and almost 13 percent compared with Brazil&amp;#039;s real, strategists said.   &amp;amp;lt;snap&amp;amp;gt;  Read more:  http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=arS...                          ...
