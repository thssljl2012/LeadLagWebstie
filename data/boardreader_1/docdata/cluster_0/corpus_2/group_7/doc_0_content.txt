As part of the biggest overseas  investment by a Chinese company, Chinalco will spend $12.3 billion on stakes of  up to 50 percent in nine of Rio's mining assets.               It will also buy $7.2 billion of  bonds convertible into shares of the world's largest aluminium maker, second-largest  iron ore miner and a top-five copper producer.               Chinalco, the parent of listed  Aluminum Corp of China Ltd (Chalco), will potentially double its stake in  Australia and London-listed Rio to 18 percent, Rio said.               The plan is likely to face close  scrutiny from the Australian government, which wants to ensure investments by  foreign state-owned entities do not come with political or strategic strings.               Shortly before Rio's announcement,  Australia's Treasurer Wayne Swan said the government would tighten foreign  ownership laws with immediate effect by treating convertible debt as if it were  equity. Rio's deal with Chinalco could also come up against Rio's former  suitor, bigger rival BHP Billiton, which may counterbid for some of the assets  Chinalco is set to pick up, the Times Newspaper said on its website on  Thursday.               In a statement, Rio cited Chinalco  as saying its aim was to diversify through the deal. Rio added it was open to  higher offers from third parties.               BACKDOWN               The bailout by Chinalco represents a  backdown for Rio Tinto Chief Executive Tom Albanese and the board, which last  year fiercely opposed a takeover offer from BHP which was worth more than twice  as much as Rio's shares now fetch.        Rio's shares are down by around a  fifth since BHP scrapped its $66 billion offer in November, dented also by  investor concern over Rio's $39 billion debt load, taken on when it bought  Alcan in 2007. Money coming in from Chinalco would ease investor concerns over  a $9 billion debt payment that Rio has due in October.               "Rio's board must be beside  themselves having to do this. It's very unfortunate timing, buying at the top  and selling at the bottom and you might have expected more given Rio's  previously exemplary track record," said Mark Pervan, senior commodities analyst  at ANZ bank.               Rio said its relationship with  Chinalco would be at "arm's length".               An agreement with Chinalco had been  widely expected after Rio's chairman-designate, Jim Leng, quit the mining group  two days ago because of objections to a tie-up with the state-run Chinese firm,  which was already Rio's top shareholder.        Rio, the world's third-biggest  diversified mining group by market value, announced the tie-up along with a 38  percent rise in full-year underlying earnings to $10.3 billion.               EARLY CRITICISM               At least two fund managers and  analysts in Australia said Rio could run into problems when shareholders vote  on the deal, which Rio said needed shareholder, government and regulatory  approval.               Criticism has focused on Rio  allowing a big state-owned customer, which has an incentive to keep prices  down, so much influence over the group and direct stakes in prized assets.               "This approach is a bit of a  worry. They seem to have favoured one shareholder over all the others,"  said ABN AMRO analyst Warren Edney.               Ken West, of Perennial Growth,  added: "It seems to me to be a blurry sort of connection that long term  may not be healthy for the market place."               Rio's London shares climbed 3.5  percent to 1,969 pence on Wednesday, outperforming a 0.7 percent increase in  the UK mining index, after jumping 6.2 percent in Australia.               Rio shares were on a trading halt in  Australia, but the cost of insuring its debt fell on word of the Chinese  investment, with Rio's credit default swaps falling 100 basis points to 525  bps, or $525,000 a year for five years to insure $10 million in debt.               Chinalco will invest the $12.3  billion in three strategic partnerships with Rio across its copper, aluminium  and iron ore divisions, taking stakes in mines and assets at Weipa, Yarwun,  Boyne &amp; Gladstone Power, Escondida, KUC, Grasberg, la Granja and Hamersley  Iron.               Rio said Chinalco would take 49.5  percent of Rio's 30 percent stake in Escondida, the world's biggest copper  mine. BHP owns 57 percent of the Chilean mine.
