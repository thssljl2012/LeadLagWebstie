         Looking at the US ADRs trading on NYSE I see prices (adjusted with current exchange rate of)  Barc 57.3p up 11% Lloyds 50.4 up 2.44% RBS 12.08p up 5.23%  So there seems to have been a recovery of sorts at least a little in the US fwiw particularly in barclays.  Citigroup and Bank of America also up quite a bit after UK close.   Cheers  Log
