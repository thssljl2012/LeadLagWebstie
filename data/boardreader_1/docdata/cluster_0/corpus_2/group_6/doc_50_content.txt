PRECIOUS-Gold extends losses as dlr holds near 3-week high Nick Trevethan, Reuters Published: Tuesday, January 06, 2009 SINGAPORE, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Gold extended losses on Tuesday, slipping more than 1 percent following Monday's drop of nearly 2 percent, faltering as the dollar reversed recent losses. Bullion's near-term direction remained pinned to the dollar, which rose 0.7 percent against the euro, at $1.3511 , holding near three-week highs versus the single currency. [USD/] "We had a bullish tilt towards gold through December but further strength in the dollar might see gold erode some of those gains," said Toby Hassall, research analyst at Commodity Warrants Australia. He added that the risks appeared weighted towards a stronger dollar and gold prices could slip another 15 percent or more in the next three months. Gold traded $11.20 or 1.3 percent lower at $847.70 an ounce by 0550 GMT, from New York's notional close on Monday, when it dipped to $843.50, its lowest in over a week. But prices around $850 to $900 could mark gold's strongest quarter until the end of 2010. "Gold could end this quarter above $900, but that may be the high for the year. By year-end it could fall as low as $700 or even $650," an Asian fund manager said. "We are pessimistic out to the middle, or the end of 2010," he said, adding that other commodities were also set to fall further. Oil prices fell 1.5 percent to $48.13 a barrel, retreating after sharp gains in the past weeek or so on geopolitical worries in the Middle East and a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas pricing. Oil has rallied from around $35 a barrel since Israel launched its Gaza offensive on Dec. 27, heightening fears of possible disruptions of crude supplies from the Middle East. [ID:nL5700436] But not all analysts were looking for the dollar rally to continue. "The dollar is the key short-term driver for gold. Over the course of the quarter we expect the dollar to weaken against the euro," said David Moore, Commonwealth Bank's commodities strategist in Sydney. Worries about the ailing international economy in the first half of 2009 would generate some safe haven demand for bullion, but slowing physical demand from India was a concern, he added. "Indian gold imports were very low and that could be significant. An impairment of Indian demand for jewellery could take out some of the floor under gold prices." Gold imports by India, the world's largest buyer of the metal, fell 81 percent in December, and were down 47 percent in 2008 as high prices and a slowing economy dented demand.
