Market Update 090121 http://biz.yahoo.com/mu/update.html 4:30 pm : A bit of short-covering helped fuel a relief rally among stocks Wednesday. The S&amp;P 500 closed 4.4% higher, but that still wasn't enough to offset the prior session's 5.3% drop. Concerted leadership from the financial sector helped drive the rebound. The ascent by financials was partly triggered by the recognition that the sector was looking oversold, having lost more than 35% in the two weeks leading up to the open. Better-than-expected results from Northern Trust (NTRS 57.51, +13.58) and word that insiders were making big purchases at Bank of America (BAC 6.68, +1.58) also provided support. Northern Trust reported fourth quarter earnings of $1.39 per share, which is $0.47 more than the $0.92 per share consensus estimate. Its shares responded by advancing 31%. Bank of America saw its stock rebound 31% after regulatory reports revealed company directors purchased the stock in the prior session, which marked a multiyear low. CEO Ken Lewis purchased some 200,000 shares at prices ranging from $5.75 to $6.06 per share. Shares of Bank of New York Mellon (BK 23.00, +4.24) registered strong gains after disclosing quarterly results that outshined State Street's (STT 17.07, +2.18) latest results, which were announced yesterday. Concerns regarding increased risks at State Street led Moody's to downgrade State Street's credit rating. U.S. Bancorp (USB 16.09, +0.75) posted earnings of $0.15 per share, which failed to meet the $0.22 per share that Wall Street forecast. The stock traded in the red for much of the session, but managed to close with a gain. U.S. Bancorp indicated during its conference call that earnings should be able to more than cover its dividend. However, if conditions become increasingly impaired, the company indicated it will not preserve the dividend. Citigroup (C 3.67, +0.87), meanwhile, cut its quarterly dividend to $0.01 per share in connection with receiving TARP funds. The quarterly dividend was $0.16 per share. Financials finished the session 14.6% higher. Their leadership helped rebuff a midmorning selling effort that took the broader market back to the neutral line. IBM (IBM 91.42, +9.44) provided leadership to all three major indices. IBM reported fourth quarter earnings of $3.28 per share, which is $0.25 better than the consensus estimate of $3.03 per share. IBM also expects 2009 earnings to be at least $9.20 per share, which is more than the $8.75 per share that Wall Street forecast. IBM's strength helped the tech sector, which is the largest in the S&amp;P 500, advance 5.4% this session. Health care, currently the second largest sector in the S&amp;P 500, advanced 2.2% with help from Abbott Labs (ABT 52.32, +3.12). Abbott reported in-line quarterly results and reaffirmed its outlook, which is also in-line with expectations. All 10 economic sectors finished higher. Whether the bounce is sustainable will only be seen in time. Many market participants believe that the broader market will not begin staging a sustainable rally until financials stabilize.

Select commodities have been able to participate in the session's generally positive bias. Crude oil futures advanced roughly 6.6% to close pit trading at $43.55 per barrel. Early trading was rather volatile as crude futures oscillated between positive and negative territory. Crude had actually been down as much as 1.5%. The latest inventory data is due tomorrow (11 AM ET). Natural gas also gained in trading. It closed at $4.72 per contract, up 1.5%. With participants bidding stocks and fuel prices higher, the energy sector is currently up 4.1%. Gold was unable to fully overcome early weakness.

Though the advance provides considerable relief to investors, stocks still have a ways to go before offsetting the 5.3% loss posted in the prior session. What's more, stocks are still down 8.4% month-to-date. Nonetheless, the advance to session highs has been broad-based. Consumer staples stocks (-0.2%), however, continue to lag as the only sector still trading with a loss. Financials stocks are now up 9.4%. They are on pace for their largest percentage advance since gaining 11.2% in mid-December.DJ30 +192.43 NASDAQ +40.96 SP500 +23.04 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 877/1812/1.46 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 849/2209/1.04 bln 2:30 pm : Since falling back to the neutral line midmorning, the stock market has gradually advanced to test its session high.

They are the only two sectors trading with losses. With defensive-oriented holdings falling out of favor, Treasuries have also come under pressure, especially at the long end of the yield curve. While the benchmark 10-year Note is down 24 ticks, the 30-year Bond is down 81 ticks. That has pushed the yield on the Note to 2.46%, while the Bond is yielding 3.09%.DJ30 +118.44 NASDAQ +25.37 SP500 +14.28 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 1005/1637/1.17 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 1055/1948/856 mln 1:30 pm : The major indices tried to break through afternoon highs, but ran into some selling resistance. Crude oil prices continue to climb higher, now up 4.8% to $42.82 per barrel. As a result, energy stocks (+2.9%) have climbed to their best level of the session.DJ30 +53.29 NASDAQ +16.01 SP500 +7.48 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 1080/1545/1.05 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 1177/1825/763 mln 1:00 pm : Stocks climbed to a gain of 2.3% in the first hour of trading, but sellers quickly re-entered the fold to send stocks back to the neutral line. Buyers have since countered to push the major indices higher. Financials have been sporting solid gains all the while. The sector is up 5.2% after being up more than 7% at its session high. Asset management and custody banks (+9.3%) have been among the best performers in the financial sector. Northern Trust (NTRS 53.95, +10.02) is garnering positive attention after posting fourth quarter earnings of $1.39 per share. That's $0.47 more than the $0.92 per share consensus estimate. Shares of Bank of New York Mellon (BK 21.57, +2.81) are making their best single-session advance by percent since a near-25% gain registered last November. The company reported adjusted earnings of $0.92 per share for its latest quarter. Including assorted charges, however, the bank earned just $0.02 per share. U.S. Bancorp (USB 13.04, -2.30) has been unable to join in the financial sector's advance. The bank posted a profit of $0.15 per share, but Wall Street was looking for $0.22 per share. Selling pressure on USB picked up after the company's conference call, during which it indicated credit costs trended higher, and net charge-offs increased. U.S. Bancorp also indicated its earnings should be able to more than cover its dividend. However, if conditions become increasingly impaired, the company indicated it will not preserve the dividend. Citigroup (C 3.15, +0.35), meanwhile, slashed its quarterly dividend to just $0.01 per share from $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. While financial stocks are sporting some of the most impressive gains this session, IBM (IBM 89.94, +7.96) is providing leadership to all three major indices. IBM reported fourth quarter earnings of $3.28 per share, which is $0.25 better than the consensus estimate of $3.03 per share.
