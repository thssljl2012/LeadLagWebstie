Gold moves away from 1-mth low as euro, oil recoverReuters, Friday January 16 2009 * Gold moves away from 1-mth low as euro, oil recover * SPDR Gold Trust's bullion holdings hit fresh record By Chikako Mogi TOKYO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Friday, moving away from the previous day's one-month low, as oil prices recovered and the euro rebounded against the dollar. Gold has been caught in a range, lacking incentives to test its upside but drawing support from its safe-haven status and appeal as an alternative to assets such as stocks, dejected by the prospect of a prolonged global recession, analysts said. Bullion's safe haven appeal was reinforced by mounting credit fears on news of further trouble at Bank of America and Citigroup, analysts said. Strong investor interest was spotlighted by news that the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, held a record 795.25 tonnes of gold by Jan. 15, up 4.59 tonnes from 790.66 tonnes on Jan. 14. "Current market levels appear to be comfortable for everyone, with support coming from such ETF buying, while the upside is limited given a lack of inflation worries," said Naomi Suzuki, an analyst at SCM Securities in Tokyo. "There is a flight-to-quality aspect behind gold buying and a view that the gold market is relatively firmer than other markets," Suzuki said. Earlier on Friday, gold moved towards a one-month low as U.S. crude futures extended declines to near $35 a barrel after a 5 percent fall on Thursday, and the U.S. dollar firmed against the euro. By 0330 GMT, gold had inched up 0.4 percent to $821.05 an ounce from New York's notional close of $817.45. Gold fell to a one-month low of $801.65 on Thursday. U.S. crude futures were up 0.3 percent at $35.69. Gold typically moves in line with crude as the direction of the oil market is an indicator of interest in commodities. The euro rebounded from earlier falls to stand up 0.9 percent against the dollar at $1.3223. The currency fell against the dollar on Thursday after the European Central Bank cut rates for the fourth month in a row, slashing rates by 50 basis points to 2 percent, matching a record low rate. A weaker dollar makes dollar-based gold less expensive for holders of other currencies. U.S. gold futures were higher in Asia, with futures for February delivery at $820.9 per ounce, up $13.6 or 1.7 percent from Thursday's settlement on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Cash platinum rose as high as $940.00 an ounce, up $17.5 from New York's notional close. The December platinum contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange rose 93 yen per gram to 2,729 yen. The TOCOM December gold contract gained 58 yen per gram to 2,393 yen.
