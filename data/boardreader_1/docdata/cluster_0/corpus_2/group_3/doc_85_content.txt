       Base metals prices to stay well above historical levels -- BarCap  London (Platts)--9Oct2008   http://www.platts.com/Metals/News/6975964.xml?p=Metals/News&amp;amp;amp;sub=Metals   Current market turmoil is unlikely to push base metal prices below historical levels as  global demand prospects look more price supportive than in previous downturns, according to analysts at UK investment bank, Barclays Capital.       Speaking at a press conference Thursday BarCap analyst Kevin Norrish said that while metals prices falling below the cost of production was not  impossible, the downside potential for complex leaders copper, aluminium and tin was &amp;#039;fairly limited&amp;#039;.        &amp;amp;quot;Copper is still very fragile,&amp;amp;quot; said Norrish, citing supply side issues like production disruptions and low exploration investment as supportive factors for the red metal&amp;#039;s price. &amp;amp;quot;Changes in the structure of demand for these metals is very positive for prices and means that they are much less sensitive to what is going on in the industrialized world.&amp;amp;quot;       Zinc, nickel and lead, however, have considerable downside potential according to the analysts who said that they price projections for the metals for 2009 were $1250/mt, $13,000/mt and $1200/mt respectively       &amp;amp;quot;Prices can still fall a long way and stay down there,&amp;amp;quot; said Norrish. &amp;amp;quot;We belive that this is a pause however, not the beginning of a deep trough. Prices should stay well above historical lows, we forget that prices are still very high -- $1,200/mt for lead would still be the fourth highest price for the metal in the past 20 years.&amp;amp;quot;        Norrish added that the amount of value wiped off base metals assets in the past quarter was relatively insignificant: &amp;amp;quot;The flow of money out of base metals in Q3 had been very small in relation to the amount of activity which has been going on. Base metals have seen an outflow of about $500 million. Commodities as a whole have lost about $60 billion, going from a value of from $270 billion in the second quarter of the year to a value of $211 billion in the third. In base metals there has been no significant flow in either direction in terms of investment, no net change.&amp;amp;quot;    --Michelle Madsen, michelle_madsen@platts.com
