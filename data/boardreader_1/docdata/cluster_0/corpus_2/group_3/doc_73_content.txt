         Hi Putney, I stand corrected - its the Barclays Stockbrokers CFD&amp;#039;s that is a wrap for City Index - not Barclays Stockbrokers, and its the latter through who I trade the Bonds. Its an OTC market so pricing is a bit frustrating compared with shares ... never seems to move in your favour!
