SYDNEY, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar held near recent lows against the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen on Wednesday, as a flight to safety gathered momentum amid fresh concerns about a sharp global downturn.    * The new bout of risk aversion saw investors dump higher-yielding currencies, stocks and commodities. The Aussie was also hurt by dovish minutes from the central bank&amp;#039;s last policy meeting, which hinted at more rate cuts.    * The financial market turmoil is expected to overshadow domestic consumer price index numbers due at 11:30 a.m. (0130 GMT). Consumer price inflation is seen rising to 4.7 percent, while core inflation should hold at a 17-year high of 4.4 percent.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already said it expects inflation to ease in the coming months as looming global recession will eventually check price pressures.    * By 9:40 a.m., the Aussie had eased to $0.6794 against the U.S. dollar, from $0.6947 late here on Tuesday. It had fallen to $0.6704 in offshore trade, which was not far from a 5- year low of $0.6330 struck earlier this month.    * The U.S. dollar climbed to its highest since February 2007 against a basket of currencies as demand for dollar liquidity increased and U.S. investors repatriated funds.    * The Aussie was at 68.31 yen, down from 70.56 yen late here on Tuesday, after a fall in stock markets led investors to unwind leveraged carry trades.    * Australian bond futures, especially at the shorter end, were supported by expectations of further rate cuts by the RBA and safe-haven inflows.    * Investors are still pricing in at least a 50 basis point cut, with some expecting a cut before the Nov. 4 meeting, as the central bank seeks to cushion the Australian economy from the adverse impact of a global slowdown.    * Three-year Australian bond futures rose 0.01 points to 95.445, while the 10-year bond contract shed 0.005 points to 94.825.
