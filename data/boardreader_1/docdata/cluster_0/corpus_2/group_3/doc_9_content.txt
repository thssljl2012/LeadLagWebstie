LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Short sterling futures jumped for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, while short-dated gilt yields fell as expectations grew that the Bank of England could cut rates by as much as 50 basis points later this week.    Calls for rate cuts were bolstered by concerns about banks across Europe and further weak economic data.    British bank stocks tumbled and Icelandic bank Landsbanki placed a freeze on new deposit and savings applications for its Icesave account.    British interest rates stand at 5 percent and markets are betting the Monetary Policy Committee could cut rates sharply when it meets on Thursday.    &amp;#039;The market is almost fully pricing in a 50 basis point cut from the BoE. If we get 25 the market will be disappointed,&amp;#039; Alessandro Tentori, rates strategist at BNP Paribas said.    At 1238 GMT the December short sterling future was up by 17 ticks to 94.73, its highest since early May. The March contract vaulted 26 ticks higher.    Yields on the 2-year gilt fell 8 basis points to 3.6 percent, their lowest level since mid-2003 according to Reuters data.    The December long gilt future fell 21 ticks to 113.88, pressured by some recovery in stocks in Europe and because investors preferred to park funds at shorter maturities.    &amp;#039;We&amp;#039;re seeing a steepening of the curve. It&amp;#039;s a flight to quality and all the money is being pushed into the front end,&amp;#039; Tentori added.    Earlier in the session the Reserve Bank of Australia injected some confidence in equity markets after it slashed interest rates by 100 basis points, signalling the possibility of coordinated central bank moves to ease rates in the coming days and weeks.    Earlier in the session an auction of 1.2 billion of 2022 index-linked gilts met a lacklustre response from investors.
