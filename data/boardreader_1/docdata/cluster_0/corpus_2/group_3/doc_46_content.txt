SYDNEY, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar stayed near record lows against the yen and 5- year troughs versus the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as investors kept away from high-yielding currencies on mounting worries of a global recession.    * Expectations the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could intervene to support the Aussie checked losses. The RBA was buying the Aussie at around the $0.6060 level during the European session on Monday, dealers said.    * A RBA spokesman said he had no information on the buying of Australian dollars during the European session. The central bank said it had intervened on Friday and in Asian trade on Monday to provide liquidity to markets.    * By 9:20 a.m. the Aussie was at $0.6015, lower than $0.6112 late here on Monday. It had fallen to $0.6007 in offshore trade, its lowest since April 2003.    * The Aussie was at 55.95 yen, not far from 55.11 yen  struck late last week, which was its lowest since it was floated in 1983. The Aussie has lost 45 percent against the yen in the last three months.    * The yen hovered near 13-year peaks against the U.S. dollar and rose to its highest since May 2002 versus the euro as the flight to lower-yielding currencies continued, despite a statement from Group of Seven financial officials expressing concern about the yen&amp;#039;s rapid surge.    * U.S. stocks closed at their lowest level in 5- years as worries about a recession dragged down energy and tech stocks. That led investors to unwind risky forex carry trades.    * Commodities were mixed. While copper was higher, oil prices continued to fall. Australia is a major exporter of resources so recent steep falls in commodity prices bode ill for the economy.    * Australian three-year bond futures were indicated 0.015 points lower at 95.705, while the 10-year futures contract shed 0.04 points to 94.88. They tailed U.S. Treasuries which fell as the start of a government programme to support the commercial paper market spurred a reversal of safe-haven buying.    * But Australian bill futures continue to price in around 100 basis points of easing by the RBA by year-end.
