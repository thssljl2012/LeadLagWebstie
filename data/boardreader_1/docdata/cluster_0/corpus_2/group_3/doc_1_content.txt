Vale do Rio Doce, the world&amp;#039;s biggest iron ore miner, and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&amp;#039;s state-controlled oil company&amp;quot;      Morgan, Goldman, Deutsche Say Brazil Stocks are Cheap (Update3)    By Alexis Xydias and Alexander Ragir    Sept. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists recommended that investors buy more Brazilian stocks as equities have become cheap after a 20 percent decline this year.    Brazilian stocks were raised to ``major overweight&amp;#039;&amp;#039; by Morgan Stanley&amp;#039;s emerging-market strategists, who cited the shares&amp;#039; prices and the earnings outlook for South America&amp;#039;s largest economy.    Brazil&amp;#039;s Bovespa index gained for a third day, rising 2.2 percent to 52,392.86.    Investors should buy raw material and energy stocks such as Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, the world&amp;#039;s biggest iron ore miner, and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&amp;#039;s state-controlled oil company, Morgan Stanley strategists led by Jonathan Garner wrote in a note to clients.    ``Absolute valuations are attractive,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; they said.    Brazil&amp;#039;s Bovespa index trades at 13.01 times earnings, compared with a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.96 on Jan. 1. Vale fell 27 percent this year, while Petrobras dropped 25 percent.    Investors should allocate 5.75 percentage points more of Brazilian stocks than are represented in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the Morgan Stanley strategists wrote.    Separately, Deutsche said in a note that the ``valuation excesses are gone&amp;#039;&amp;#039; for Brazilian stocks and investors should shift into stocks that benefit from consumer demand.    ``The time is right to start a rotation towards the interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as consumer discretionary, homebuilders and wireless telecoms,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; wrote Deutsche strategist Guilherme Paiva. He recommended PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes, B2W Cia. Global do Varejo, Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA, Vivo Participacoes SA.    Goldman Sachs    Goldman said yesterday that Brazilian stocks are the cheapest in the Americas when comparing estimated earnings for the next twelve months.    The MSCI Brazil index trades at a price that is 8.1 times estimated earnings, according to the New York-based bank. Argentina, with a price to earnings ratio of 8.3, is the next cheapest, Goldman said. Chilean stocks are the most expensive, trading at 13.9 times estimated earnings, followed by the U.S., which trades at 12.5 times earnings.    ``Brazil&amp;#039;s low P/E is partially explained by its high exposure to Energy and Materials, typically low P/E sectors,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Goldman strategist David Kostin wrote in a note.    The Bovespa fell 29 percent from its May high as interest rates rose and commodity prices dropped.    The Reuters Jefferies Commodities Index dropped 24 percent from its July 2 high.    Brazil Rates    Brazil&amp;#039;s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest in almost two years on Sept. 10 in a bid to cool accelerating economic growth that&amp;#039;s stoking inflation.    Deutsche Bank said today it expects the central bank to start cutting rates from September 2009.    Morgan Stanley also raised Turkey to ``equal-weight&amp;#039;&amp;#039; from ``underweight,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; meaning investors should hold as many of the shares as are represented in the emerging-market benchmark.    Malaysia and Thailand were cut by the bank to ``equal- weight&amp;#039;&amp;#039; from ``overweight,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; while Egypt was downgraded to ``underweight&amp;#039;&amp;#039; from ``equal-weight.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;    To contact the reporter on this story: Alexis Xydias in London at  axydias@bloomberg.net .
