Yamana CEO confident gold will reach US$1,500/oz   Gold slipped 1.04% to US$713/oz on the London Bullion Market on  Friday, its lowest level in more than a year.      According to Barclays Capital,  the decline in the price was  brought on by further pressures from a strengthening US dollar  compared to most other currencies.       In March this year gold reached a nominal record of  US$1,011/oz.      &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t believe that is the ultimate high-water mark for gold.  Over time the US$1,500/oz gold price is not unrealistic,&amp;quot; Marrone  said.      Given the current market conditions there will be potentially long  delays with some smaller and medium scale miners, and also  development stage companies that expected to put projects into  production, according to Marrone, adding that this future shortage  of expected gold supply will in turn support gold prices.      Toronto brokerage Blackmont Capital  forecasts a gold price of  US$850/oz for the remainder of 2008, 2009 and the  long-term.     http://www.bnamericas.com/news/metals/Yamana_CEO_confident_gold_will_reach_US*1,500_oz
