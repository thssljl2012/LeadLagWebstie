         The problem with this approach, Teddy, is that everyone proclaimed it was the only way to value Japan versus P/E back in the 80&amp;#039;s, and look what happened. At today&amp;#039;s close we&amp;#039;re still down 78% from the Dec 29, 1989 38,900+change high, and that&amp;#039;s divi- and stock-split adjusted.  You only have to look at what Toyota, Mazda, Nissan, Sony, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, property groups like Mitsui Fudosan are saying.  From Bloomberg:   Sony Corp., the world&amp;#039;s second-largest maker of consumer electronics, slashed its annual profit forecast for the second time in as many quarters, citing the stronger yen and a slump in the value of stock holdings.   Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. may report profit fell last quarter, as plunging vehicle demand and currency swings force Asian carmakers to abandon earnings goals.   Toyota&amp;#039;s net income for the three months ended Sept. 30, probably fell 50 percent to 227 billion yen ($2.28 billion), according to five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The company&amp;#039;s full-year profit will be 1.05 trillion yen, 16 percent lower than its forecast, according to analysts.  Toyota has fallen 43 percent so far this year on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Honda has declined 44 percent and Nissan has dropped 62 percent. Hyundai has slumped 29 percent.       Given I was replying on the UKFool banking board this morning about this (well, Standard Chartered bak in particular), this is since April 7th:  Hang Seng -44% Nikkei -40% Nifty -37% (India) ASX -34% Kuala Lumpur -27%  Some of the main Asian banking players:  DBS -44% (Singapore) Macquarie -44% (Oz) Sumitomo Mitsui -37% MitsubishiUFJ -25% Mizuho -26% Bank Of China -42% Industrial and Commercial Bank of China -41% Korea Exchange -41% Pu San Bank -41% (Korea) ICICI (India) -55%   The main relative outperformers so far have been the commercial Aussie banks, broker Nomura, and most banks in India. I didn&amp;#039;t have time to look at the Malay, Taiwan, Indonesian or Vietnamese performance. But it&amp;#039;s pretty obvious that there is no &amp;amp;quot;decoupling&amp;amp;quot; - that&amp;#039;s just complete bollocks. And then read this:   http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;amp;amp;sid=aZiJ... ...  &amp;amp;lt;snip&amp;amp;gt; The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific bonds from default rose to a record as investors sought to minimize risk amid a worsening global economic outlook.   The Markit iTraxx Australia index of credit-default swaps was quoted 60 basis points higher at 360 as of 2:45 p.m. in Sydney, Citigroup Inc. data show. The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 22 basis points to 250 at 12:48 p.m. in Tokyo, according to prices from Barclays Capital. Prices rise as perceptions of credit quality decline.   And then there&amp;#039;s specific coprporate counterparty risk:   http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/21/business/default.php   &amp;amp;lt;snip&amp;amp;gt; A big wave of defaults could be forming among small and midsize companies in Asia, raising the specter of a pile of bad loans at banks in the region and a further plunge in investor trust.  ------- &amp;amp;lt;and&amp;amp;gt; Some bonds are already trading at pennies to the dollar. Bonds due in 2014 for the South Korean company Magnachip Semiconductor were quoted at 6.5 cents to the dollar after Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s cut its ratings on the company last week to CCC, well below investment-grade, because of &amp;amp;quot;severe liquidity problems.&amp;amp;quot;  A wave of bankruptcies also runs the risk of hitting earnings at regional lenders, given their high exposure from loans to small and midsize companies, making them less likely to lend at precisely the time when companies need financing the most.  Asian banks excluding those in Japan already have the highest ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans of any emerging-market region, at 4.9, according to data compiled by ING.  Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, China, Malaysia and the Philippines all have above-average ratios of nonperforming loans to total loans among global emerging markets.   -------------------------------------------  And Japan ain&amp;#039;t going to decpuple from these countries.
