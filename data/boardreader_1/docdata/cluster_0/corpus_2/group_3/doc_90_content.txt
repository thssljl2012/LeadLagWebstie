          October 15, 2008   http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/fears-send-london-shares-crashing-962230.html     Fears send London shares crashing !   Recession fears came to the fore today to undo the rally in London shares, sending the FTSE 100 index down more than 7 per cent.   More grim news on the economy, including a rapid raise in unemployment figures, sparked fears for investors that Government action would not be enough to avoid a long-term recession.    The concerns were echoed around the world. In New York, the Dow Jones also fell nearly 4 per cent. Both France&amp;amp;#039;s Cac and Germany&amp;amp;#039;s Dax also fell nearly 7 per cent.     In London, Heavyweight commodity stocks were weighed down by falling oil and metal prices.   The declines come after a recent rally on optimism over global banking bail-outs.   The downbeat economic sentiment was not helped after UK unemployment jumped at its fastest rate in 17 years during the three months to August.   Miners occupied the top ten places on the blue-chip fallers board after metal prices dipped, leaving Xstrata - off 247p at 1069p - the leading Footsie casualty with an 18 per cent plunge.   The stock was closely followed by Kazakhmys down 81p at 352.25p and Anglo American off 262p at 1398p as brokers at Bernstein marked down the sector on weakening demand.   The fears sent crude oil for November delivery down to 76.05 dollars a barrel - the lowest since September last year - as oil cartel OPEC also scaled back its estimates for global demand in 2009.   This hit BP, off 10.25p at 436.5p, with Royal Dutch Shell off 29p to 1422p. Elsewhere in the sector prospector Tullow Oil lost 44p to 515p while oil and gas services firm Wood Group was 22p worse off at 238.25p.   Attention was focused on the banking sector after reports the Treasury was under pressure to rework its 37 billion bail-out, in particular to allow some dividend income for investors.   Lloyds TSB and HBOS have been under pressure since the rescue, but the possibility of investor payouts helped lift sentiment. Lloyds rose 13.8p to 165.1p and HBOS stemmed recent falls to rise 1p to 86.3p.   Royal Bank of Scotland - raising 20 billion from the Government - rose 3.5p to 68.5p, or 5 per cent.   Barclays, which does not plan to use taxpayer funds, continued its advance with a 2p gain to 248p, unshaken by a downgrade from brokers at HSBC.   In corporate news, software group Autonomy was another Footsie riser after third-quarter results at the top end of market hopes. Shares rose 27.5p to 845.5p.   Elsewhere pubs chain Marston&amp;amp;#039;s shed 14.5p to 102.5p - a fall of 12 per cent - as the group reported subdued sales and rising costs.   But online gaming site Sportingbet lifted 11 per cent or 3p to 30p as it said demand remained strong, despite the weaker economic conditions.
