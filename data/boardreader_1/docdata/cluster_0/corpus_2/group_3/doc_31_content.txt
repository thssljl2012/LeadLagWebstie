For now, the cartel&amp;#039;s decision Friday to trim 1.5 million barrels a day from its output target won&amp;#039;t put the brakes on oil prices&amp;#039; nose dive, analysts said. The reasons have to do with oil-supply dynamics and global financial markets.                      Any constriction of supply on the back of OPEC&amp;#039;s decision won&amp;#039;t be felt for weeks. In addition, the cartel has a spotty compliance record. Stock markets also reflect mounting evidence that world economic growth is stagnating, and possibly reversing. Oil has paralleled stocks&amp;#039; path on fears that a weaker economy will result in anemic demand.    Stocks tend to precede the bottom of the business cycle, said Merrill Lynch strategist Francisco Blanch, and commodity bear markets descend alongside it. With stock markets continuing to fall, he said that suggests the economy is set to slow further.    Benchmark crude futures on Friday settled at a 17-month low, falling $3.69, or 5.4%, to $64.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In the near term, prices could keep falling, with many analysts pointing to $50-a-barrel crude if an economic slump persists.    &amp;quot;From the get-go, I never anticipated the OPEC production cut would make a lot of difference to this market, simply because there are so many other things going on,&amp;quot; said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Galena, Ill.-based energy-trading advisory firm Ritterbusch and Associates.    OPEC said it will lower its production ceiling, now 28.8 million barrels a day, by 1.5 million barrels a day starting Nov. 1. The cartel spelled out how much each member agreed to take off the market. Cutting 466,000 barrels a day, Saudi Arabia would shoulder the biggest share. But OPEC members Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela are already under quota, according to recent International Energy Agency estimates.    And assuming not every country rigidly adheres to Friday&amp;#039;s agreement, the actual cut is likely to be 1.16 million barrels a day, said Lawrence Eagles, head of commodity research at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co. in New York. That amount could lead to evenly balanced supply and demand by year&amp;#039;s end, Mr. Eagles said. It also indicates further cuts could be needed in the first half of next year.    J.P. Morgan stands by its forecast that oil prices will average $79 a barrel in the fourth quarter, and about $70 a barrel early next year, Mr. Eagles said.    Others said OPEC would need to cut more than 1.5 million barrels a day to meet its new production goal, as the cartel produced about 530,000 barrels a day over quota in September. If the group succeeds, Barclays Capital analyst Costanza Jacazio said demand could outpace supply next year, tightening the market. Barclays sees crude averaging $105 a barrel in the second half of 2009.    However much is cut, it will take time for the effects to sink in. Tankers need more than a month to sail from the Persian Gulf to the U.S. and at least 20 days to reach Europe or Japan, said Harry Tchilinguirian, senior oil-market analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Derivatives in London.    Tim Evans, energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective, said OPEC&amp;#039;s new output stance may have rescued crude from a deeper decline Friday. &amp;quot;While it might be tempting to conclude that the OPEC decision was bearish, we think it will prove effective in raising the ultimate floor for prices,&amp;quot; he said in a note. Another cut could push prices higher, he added.    OPEC&amp;#039;s next meeting is scheduled for Dec. 17.    In trying to establish a price floor, OPEC is up against factors beyond its control. Fears of a global recession, and its effect on oil demand, are pummeling stock and oil markets concurrently. Oil prices may stay largely detached from supply factors for months to come.    World stock markets sank again Friday, and investors&amp;#039; rush to avoid risky assets amid the financial crisis has also contributed to oil&amp;#039;s 56% decline from July. &amp;quot;If equity markets stabilize in the next month, people will pay closer attention to the fundamentals of the oil markets,&amp;quot; Mr. Tchilinguirian said. &amp;quot;But because the equity markets right now are the bellwether of economic sentiment, whatever happens there is going to affect how people trade oil.&amp;quot;    The IEA forecasts world oil demand growing by less than 1% annually this year and in 2009. Other forecasters see world-wide demand contracting next year for the first time since 1983.    Even if OPEC had agreed to a more aggressive cut, Mr. Tchilinguirian said, it &amp;quot;could have been perceived as negative for the world economy and sent prices lower anyway.&amp;quot;     Write to  Gregory Meyer at   greg.meyer@dowjones.com               thread start
