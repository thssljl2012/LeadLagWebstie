Estimates had ranged from a deficit of A$800 million to a surplus of A$1.2 billion.    NEWS: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) added A$3.159 billion in repurchase agreements, below an estimated daily need of A$3.535 billion, effectively draining A$376 million. But banks&amp;#039; cash cushion with the RBA would still be around A$9 billion. ___________________________________  ____________________________    * The Australian dollar rose to a session high of $0.7945 against the U.S. dollar, drawing support from solid trade numbers and relief that a financial bailout package was passed by the U.S. Senate.    * But the Aussie quickly gave up those gains amid strong expectations of an aggressive domestic interest rate cut next week and mounting risk aversion. Investors are pricing in a 50 basis point rate cut when the RBA meets next week to decide on monetary policy.    * The possible cut will be to counter a spike in interbank lending rates and tight financial conditions as banks have been reluctant to lend to each other.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie was at 0.7900 against the U.S. dollar, down from $0.7973 late here on Wednesday, but off a two-week low of $0.7857 struck offshore.    * Against the yen, the Aussie fell to 83.56 yen, from 84.44 yen late here on Wednesday as worries about a slowdown in the global economy led regional stock markets lower and undermined demand for risky leveraged carry trades.    * Australian bond futures were firmer on safe haven inflows and as investors were convinced about a second rate cut in as many months from the RBA early next week.    * Three-year bond futures rose 0.02 points to 94.91, while the 10-year bond contract added 0.025 points to 94.60.
