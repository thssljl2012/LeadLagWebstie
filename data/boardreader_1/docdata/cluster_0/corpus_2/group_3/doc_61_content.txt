It looks like my earlier post needs to be updated. Australia cut 100bps, as Kiwi noted. Is this the beginning of a global coordinated rate cut? What good will a rate cut do? There&amp;#039;s an interesting perspective from the  Telegraph .         Sydney rebounds on rate cut, others move off lows    Nikkei 225 down 1.2% but well off lows amid bargain hunting           Quote   MarketWatch wrote:      HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Australian shares rebounded strongly Tuesday, boosted by a larger-than-expected full percentage-point interest rate cut by the country&amp;#039;s central bank amid a worsening financial markets crisis worldwide.        Stocks elsewhere were mostly down, though they pared early losses, as bargain buyers snapped up beaten-down shares at lower levels.        In Sydney, the S&amp;amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index gained 1% to 4,587, spurred by the rate cut. Earlier in the day, the index slumped as low as 4,391.90.        The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its benchmark rate by a percentage point to 6.0% from 7.0%. The move came amid a global financial crisis, falling consumer spending and the slowest growth in Australian home borrowing since the 1980s.          Futures are solidly green at this point. Maybe it&amp;#039;s time for a little sleep.
