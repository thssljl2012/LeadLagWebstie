Oil falls to 14-month low on bad US economic data   Thursday October 16, 4:24 am ET   By Alex Kennedy, Associated Press Writer   Oil falls to 14-month low below $72 in Asia as bad US economic news  fuels recession fears         SINGAPORE (AP) -- Oil prices fell to a 14-month low Thursday in  Asia as bad U.S. economic news stoked fears that a significant  global economic slowdown will undermine demand for crude.   Light, sweet crude for November delivery was down $2.90 to $71.64 a  barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange by  midafternoon in Singapore. The contract fell overnight $4.09 to  settle at $74.54, the lowest settlement price since Aug. 31,  2007.      ADVERTISEMENT         Oil prices are now half of the peak they reached in July.      &amp;quot;The market is just very worried about a severe international  economic downturn,&amp;quot; said David Moore, commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. &amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re thinking that  oil consumption will be weaker than expected.&amp;quot;      Investors were discouraged Wednesday by a U.S. Commerce Department  report that showed retail sales dropped in September by 1.2  percent, a sign that turmoil in the credit markets has begun to  slow consumer spending. Later in the day, the Beige Book, the  assessment of business conditions from the Federal Reserve, said  that the economy continued to slow in the early fall.      Japan&amp;#039;s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average was down nearly 10  percent Thursday while the Dow Jones industrials plummeted 733  points Wednesday, or 7.9 percent, it&amp;#039;s second-largest point loss  ever.      &amp;quot;If we&amp;#039;re in the grips of a severe downturn, it&amp;#039;s very hard to pick  where things will bottom,&amp;quot; Moore said. &amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s the potential that  bad economic news will continue to rattle markets.&amp;quot;      Investors are beginning to anticipate an output cut by the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at its next meeting  in November in a bid to boost prices, Moore said.      OPEC said in a report Wednesday that oil consumption dropped in  developed countries by more than 1 million barrels a day in  September compared to the same period a year earlier. Demand growth  from developing countries increased by a daily 1.2 million barrels  over the same time, OPEC said.      &amp;quot;OPEC may try to take some action,&amp;quot; Moore said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s quite likely  they will adjust lower their production targets.&amp;quot;      In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures fell 5.85 cents to  $2.13 a gallon, while gasoline prices decreased 6.17 cents to $1.72  a gallon. Natural gas for November delivery dropped 11.3 cents to  $6.48 per 1,000 cubic feet.      In London, November Brent crude fell $2.85 to $67.95 a barrel on  the ICE Futures exchange.
