NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday after European government plans to pump billions into troubled banks and guarantee bank borrowing helped the currency sprint away from a 1-1/2-year low against the dollar.    Sterling also gained after the UK government said it would pour $64 billion into three of its biggest banks as part of a plan to restore confidence in what has become the worst global financial crisis in 80 years. For details, see    Germany approved a 500 billion euro rescue plan on Monday, and the French government was set to create a $55 billion fund to take stakes in its banks, media reports said.    European shares soared while U.S. stocks rebounded smartly from Friday&amp;#039;s precipitous decline. Unlimited dollar auctions from the Federal Reserve and three other central banks also weakened demand for dollars and prompted investors to take on more risk after running for the hills on Friday.    The bank bailout &amp;#039;is the first positive step in the right direction and demonstrates the ability of officials to act in concert, which should provide the euro with a boost of confidence for the time being,&amp;#039; said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at GFT Forex in New York.    Midday in New York, the euro was up 1 percent at $1.3549 , more than a cent off its session peak but well above Friday&amp;#039;s low of $1.3257, its weakest level since March, 2007.    Against the yen, the euro climbed 1.3 percent to 136.75 . The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 100.91 yen.    The low-yield yen surged last week as anxious investors unwound trades financed with the Japanese currency, but renewed risk appetite made it one of the poorest performers on Monday.    Sterling rose 2.1 percent to $1.7396 after slumping to a five-year low near $1.68 on Friday.    Tokyo bourses and New York bond markets were closed for national holidays, sapping trading volume.    RECESSION WORRIES PERSIST    The United States, which adopted a $700 billion rescue earlier this month, said it too would take stakes in banks, its first such move since the Great Depression, and Australia said it would guarantee deposits in its banks. [ID:nCRISIS].    Australia&amp;#039;s move helped stem aggressive selling of the Australian dollar, which rose 5.5 percent to $0.6780.    It would be a mistake, however, to assume that anxiety had been wiped out by the collective rescue plans, investors said. Last week, Wall Street had its worst week ever while European shares fell more than 20 percent, and the dollar soared as investors seeking safety snapped up the U.S. currency.    &amp;#039;I think we are not out of the woods yet when it comes to safe haven flows,&amp;#039; said Divyang Shah, chief market strateigst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in London.    &amp;#039;The credit crunch for households and non-financials as well as a U.S. consumer recession are still issues that we have to overcome,&amp;#039; he added. &amp;#039;Demand for dollars will continue.&amp;#039;    Stephen Jen, global head of currency research at Morgan Stanley, added the world still risks falling into recession.    &amp;#039;Investors should sell into any relief rally we might see in the short term,&amp;#039; he wrote in a note to clients. &amp;#039;This means the dollar should resume its rally against the euro and emerging market currencies in a matter of days, I suspect.&amp;#039;    (Additional reporting by Veronica Brown in London;  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) Keywords: MARKETS FOREX    tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomson.com    ak    COPYRIGHT    Copyright Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
