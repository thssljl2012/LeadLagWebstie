LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Sterling held firm against the dollar and the euro on Thursday, still sustained by a favourable view of Britain&amp;#039;s bank recapitalisation action even as recent data portrayed deepening domestic economic weakness.    Although the U.S. unit gained traction broadly on a fresh wave of risk aversion, the perception that the UK is ahead of the curve in dealing with the worst crisis since the 1930s helped keep the pound off last week&amp;#039;s five-year lows.    &amp;#039;With all these rescue plans being delivered by various countries, the UK has essentially taken the lead,&amp;#039; said Adarsh Sinha, senior FX strategist at Barclays Capital in London.    &amp;#039;Even though major countries have adopted similar plans, including the rest of Europe and the U.S., the UK has come out of this better as it has helped policy credibility -- that&amp;#039;s very important for sterling,&amp;#039; he added.    By 0807 GMT, sterling was up 0.3 percent on the day at $1.7235, staying away from last week&amp;#039;s five-year low around the $1.68 mark. The euro was down 0.3 percent at 78.03 pence.    But while Britain&amp;#039;s crisis-busting credentials are still drawing praise, economic data has provided hefty doses of reality this week.    Figures released on Wednesday showed that British unemployment shot up at its fastest pace since the early 1990s recession this summer, with bigger rises predicted as the financial crisis takes it toll across the economy [ID:nLF22414].    UK inflation surged to an annualised 5.2 percent in September [ID:nLE168563], while the economy&amp;#039;s weakness was also underlined on Tuesday by a report showing the decline in UK house prices accelerated in September and sales fell to their lowest in at least 30 years [ID:nLD172022].    On top of that, retail sales fell for a fourth straight month [ID:nLD465547], offering further evidence the UK economy was sliding into recession and bolstering rate cut expectations.    The BoE last week joined other major central banks in delivering rate cuts to help deal with the banking crisis, a move that took UK base rates to 4.5 percent.    A Reuters poll conducted after the coordinated rate cuts showed most economists expect the BoE to cut rates by an additional 50 basis points by year-end [BOE/INT].    Rate cuts are seen eroding sterling&amp;#039;s yield appeal versus other currencies, but as the global economy is expected to slide into recession, some analysts said the pound may rise if monetary easing stimulates growth.
