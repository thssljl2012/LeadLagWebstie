Oil Slips Below $83 on Fears of Demand Slump   Topics:China   Saudi Arabia   Iran   OPEC   Natural Disasters    Natural Gas   Alternative Energy   Energy   Sectors:Oil and GasBy Reuters   10 Oct 2008   08:01 AM ET Text Size  Oil fell below $83 a barrel after a fall to its lowest in 12 months  on Friday, depressed by expectations global demand growth will  shrink if the credit crisis pushes the world economy into  recession.         CNBC.com   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------         Economic weakness spurred the International Energy Agency (IEA) to  cut its forecasts for world oil demand growth for 2008 to its  lowest rate since 1993.      U.S. light, sweet crude [US@CL.1 82.81 -3.78 (-4.37%)] for November  delivery was sharply lower.      It touched a session low of $81.13, its lowest since October  2007.      Prices have dropped nearly 45 percent from a peak of $147.27 in  July.      London Brent crude [GB@IB.1 79.96 -4.00 (-4.76%)] was down, below  $80 for the first time in a year.      The IEA, which advises 28 industrialised nations, cut its world  demand growth forecast for 2008 to 0.5 percent -- the lowest in  percentage terms since 1993.

Commodities have tumbled along with global stock markets, which  suffered heavy losses in Asia.      British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it would be &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; for  OPEC to cut production just as oil prices are falling.      &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m concerned when I hear that the OPEC countries are meeting, or  are about to meet, to discuss cutting production -- in other words,  making the price potentially higher than it should be,&amp;quot; Brown told  reporters.      &amp;quot;So I&amp;#039;m making it clear to OPEC also today that it would be wrong  for the world economy -- wrong for British people who are paying  high petrol prices and high fuel prices at the moment -- for OPEC  to cut production.&amp;quot;      The Nikkei index [JP;N225 8276.43 -881.0605 (-9.62%) ] plunged  nearly 10 percent. European shares were down nearly 7 percent.      Investors, who earlier this year piled into oil and other  commodities as a hedge against inflation and the weak dollar, now  want safety.      &amp;quot;Commodity indices suffered heavy losses over the past week as  market sentiment continue to focus on the potential demand-side  weakness associated with the ongoing instability in the financial  sector,&amp;quot; Barclays Capital said in a note.      A key question is how far will prices fall.      &amp;quot;We find oil prices would need to fall to $35 a barrel in order to  bring prices in real terms back to their long run historical  averages,&amp;quot; Deutsche Bank said in a note.      From Fast Money      The Bear: One Year Later   But it also said that, given the geographical location of marginal  demand and supply, $60 a barrel was a more realistic  characterisation of &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; oil.      Gold, a traditional safe haven, jumped more than 2 percent on  Friday to a 2-1/2 month high of $931 an ounce.      Investors will this weekend look to Washington, where finance  ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven nations will  meet to look for ways to contain the crisis.
