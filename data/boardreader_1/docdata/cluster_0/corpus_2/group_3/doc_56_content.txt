  Crude Oil Rises Before OPEC Meeting to Discuss Production Cuts       By Christian Schmollinger        Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil rose in New York, rebounding from a 16-month low, before a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss production cuts.       OPEC may cut output by more than the expected 1 million barrels a day predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg News survey when they meet tomorrow in Vienna. A reduction of that size won&amp;#039;t be sufficient, said Shokri Ghanem, Libya&amp;#039;s top oil official yesterday. Iran&amp;#039;s energy minister, Gholamhossein Nozari, said the group may slash production by 2.5 million barrels a day.       ``The comments talking of quite large cuts in production may be fashioning market expectations of what OPEC might do,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said   David Moore  , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in Sydney. ``Some of these larger cuts that have been talked about imply a fairly significant tightening of the oil market.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       Crude oil for December delivery rose as much as $1.06, or 1.6 percent, to $67.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $67.60 a barrel at 8:24 a.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, crude oil futures fell $5.43 to $66.75 a barrel in New York, the lowest settlement since June 13, 2007.       Prices, which have tumbled 55 percent since reaching a record $147.27 on July 11, are down 24 percent from a year ago.       Brent crude oil for December settlement rose as much as 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $65.47 a barrel on London&amp;#039;s ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was at $65.42 a barrel at 8:39 a.m. Singapore time. The contract fell yesterday $5.20, or 7.5 percent, to $64.52 a barrel, the lowest close since May 7, 2007.       Global oil inventories are ``high&amp;#039;&amp;#039; as some OPEC members struggle to sell crude amid the global financial crisis, OPEC President Chakib Khelil said yesterday as he arrived in Vienna.       ``The question of reduction has to be discussed,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Khelil. ``Stocks are very high, there is excess of supply, some of us are not able to sell their crude.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       He declined to comment on the size of the production quotas.
