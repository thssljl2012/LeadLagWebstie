Indonesia Halts Stock Trading After 10 Percent Plunge ( By Berni Moestafa  Oct. 8 (Bloomberg)-- Indonesia&amp;#039;s stock exchange halted share-market trading for the first time in eight years after the benchmark index plunged 10 percent, the biggest decline since the 1998 Asian financial crisis.  Trading was suspended indefinitely, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement. The Jakarta Composite Index plummeted the most of any market in Asia, where credit market turmoil drove the MSCI Asia Pacific Index to its biggest loss since 1990. Almost a quarter of Indonesian shares fell at least 10 percent and bonds and the rupiah declined. The cost to protect government debt from default rose to the highest level since at least 2004.  ``People are panicking,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Suherman Santikno, head of research at Jakarta-based PT Batavia Prosperindo Sekuritas which manages about $573 million in assets.``With uncertainty in the global economy, it&amp;#039;s best to hold cash.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  PT Astra International, Indonesia&amp;#039;s largest auto retailer, tumbled 20 percent and PT Indosat, the nation&amp;#039;s second-biggest telephone company, fell 23 percent on concern slower global growth will erode domestic consumption. PT Adaro Energy, Indonesia&amp;#039;s second-largest coal producer, plunged 19 percent to 810 rupiah.  Indonesia is battling rising inflation at the same time as the global credit crisis may slow exports. The country&amp;#039;s central bank raised its key interest rate yesterday by a quarter-basis point to 9.5 percent after inflation accelerated to 12.1 percent.  Credit Default Swaps  The benchmark stock index is down 21 percent this week, the worst weekly drop since at least April 1983, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The rupiah declined 0.7 percent to 9,635 per dollar, trading near its lowest level in three years.  ``Under an irrational market situation, we can&amp;#039;t let the market mechanism govern stock prices in a disorderly manner,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Ahmad Fuad Rahmany, chairman of Indonesia&amp;#039;s capital market regulator, said in a mobile phone text message.``It&amp;#039;s justified for us to suspend&amp;#039;&amp;#039; trading if the index falls more than 20 percent in just three days, he said.  The yield on the 9.5 percent note due June 2015 rose 29 basis points to 14.70 percent, compared with 14.41 percent yesterday, according to midday prices at the Inter Dealer Market Association. The price fell 1.046, or 1,046 rupiah per 1 million rupiah face amount, to 78.287.  Credit-default swap contracts on Indonesia jumped 80 basis points to 560 at 2:00 p.m. in Singapore, Barclays Capital prices show. That means it costs $80,000 more a year to protect $10 million of the country&amp;#039;s debt from default for five years.  ``Too much of the Indonesian market is tied to commodities,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Kim Yong Tae, head of overseas investment at Yurie Asset Management Inc. in Seoul, which has the equivalent of $1.2 billion in equity assets.``Also, the currency is very weak, suggesting that a lot of speculative money is pulling out of the market.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;
