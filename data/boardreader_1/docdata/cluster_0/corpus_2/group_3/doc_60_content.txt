It has already cut the benchmark federal funds rate to 1.5 percent from 5.25 percent over the past 13 months.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie had eased to $0.6436, but was still higher than $0.6125 late here on Tuesday. Earlier that day it touched a five-and-a-half year low of $0.6007 with hedge funds also unwinding short Aussie positions following a third round of intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).    * The Aussie eased to 62.87 yen, having rallied to 64.77 yen from 57.41 yen late here on Tuesday. Last week it had hit its lowest level since being floated, falling to 55.11 yen.    * The yen pared losses against other major currencies in Asian trade after suffering its biggest daily fall against the U.S. dollar since 1974 on Tuesday.    * Australian bond futures were mixed, with the shorter end lower as safe-haven inflows eased. But bill futures pared losses amid expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the RBA in the near term as it seeks to cushion the economy from the credit crunch.    * Three-year bond futures eased 0.045 points to 95.525, while the 10-year futures contract added 0.045 points to 94.860.
