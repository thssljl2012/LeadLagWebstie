 Fri Oct 3, 2008 10:27am EDT PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - European stocks further rose in late trade on Friday, tracking sharp gains on Wall Street as hopes over the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives on the bailout and a bank takeover eclipsed bleak U.S. jobs data.  Data showing that growth in the U.S. services sector held up in September also helped lift sentiment.  At 1424 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1.7 percent at 1,075.11 points.  Recently-hammered banking stocks were on the upside, with BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) up 6.3 percent, UBS (UBSN.VX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) up 8.3 percent and Barclays (BARC.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) up 7.7 percent.  /.  http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idCAL3448283...
