   INTERVIEW-HKMerc exchange investors stall for time amid crisis         SINGAPORE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Companies seeking to be members or invest in the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange (HKMEx) have asked for more time as they grapple with the financial crisis but have not withdrawn from the plan, a top HKMEx official said on Monday.      The commodities exchange&amp;#039;s first contract, for fuel oil, is being finetuned while it seeks alternative delivery points, said president Thomas J. McMahon, after a Chinese directive appeared to ban the use of delivery terminals by foreign exchanges on mainland China.      Despite the slowdown, the contract remains on target to launch in March 2009, he told Reuters ahead of the annual Asia-Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC).      &amp;amp;quot;We have the same number of signed partners (as before the crisis), but some people have asked for a few more weeks, others for a few months,&amp;amp;quot; McMahon said. &amp;amp;quot;Some companies do not know what is going to happen. This is a life-changing event.&amp;amp;quot;      When the HKMEx was announced in June, it flaunted a list of potential investors and members that included investments banks such as now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, which has since agreed to merge with Bank of America, as well as Barclays Capital .      Others included brokerages Cantor Fitzgerald and MF Global, and diversified commodities trading form Noble Group .      But Reliance Money, a unit of India&amp;#039;s Reliance Capital , said last week it bought a 15 percent stake in HKMEx.      McMahon, a former board member of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and a veteran energy trader, says the crisis engulfing global economies would enhance the need for exchanges.      &amp;amp;quot;Do people need to buy a house? No, even though they need a place to live in. But do they need to eat? Yes. They need commodities and they need to price them, whether the price of oil is at $150 or at $73 a barrel,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      The industry has been very wary of the new contract so far, after several fuel oil contracts failed in Asia, and as they see the focus moving from 180-centistoke fuel oil -- which the HKMEx is looking at -- to 380 centistoke that is mainly used in the marine fuel market.       McMahon said the credit crisis may act as a springboard for the fuel oil contract, as the deregulated oil industry in Singapore flees over-the-counter (OTC) deals for the safety of regulated exchanges.      Some oil derivative trades have carried on with the aid of clearing exchanges such as NYMEX&amp;#039;s Clearport, which assumes the credit risk on behalf of both counterparties, but a lot of trade has evaporated as the crisis shakes confidence.        UPHILL BATTLE      But while existing exchanges and clearing houses such as Clearport may attract more trading, the proposed HKMEx contract faces hurdles to gain the market&amp;#039;s favour.      The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) posted a directive in July asking domestic exchanges to closely watch deliveries at terminals, and banning foreign exchanges from using mainland warehouses for contract-related deliveries until new regulation is passed, according to news reports.      Although McMahon denied the directive could put the contract at risk as he sees bonded storage as outside of the CSRC&amp;#039;s jurisdiction, he added the exchange was looking at alternative delivery points, in Hong Kong and Macao, for instance.      &amp;amp;quot;We want to give the industry the opportunity to receive delivery at different points,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      The HKMEx was formed with the support of Titan Petrochemicals , which has bonded storage in China, and this summer&amp;#039;s directive was seen by many as a blow.      &amp;amp;quot;All regulators try to protect their market. You have to respect the regulators where they stand and we are not going into conflict with them,&amp;amp;quot; he said. McMahon said Titan has taken a step back after helping form the exchange and would be a shareholder as any other.      He declined to comment on other potential shareholders, such as China&amp;#039;s energy giants Sinopec Corp and PetroChina , which are seen as crucial to the success of the venture, but said interest was there.      &amp;amp;quot;We have a good response from mainland China.&amp;amp;quot;      An agreement has also yet to be finalised with LCH.Clearnet, which is to act as clearing house for the exchange.      &amp;amp;quot;Technically, we have not finalised (the deal) but in terms of our clock and the work we have done, we are quite down the road,&amp;amp;quot; he added.
