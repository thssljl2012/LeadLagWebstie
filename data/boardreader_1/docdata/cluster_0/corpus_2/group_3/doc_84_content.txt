Bond prices fell as investors sought bargains in equity markets following Monday&amp;#039;s big stock market drops.    On Tuesday morning, the Canadian dollar was at C$1.1013 to the U.S. dollar, or 90.80 cents, down from C$1.0992 to the U.S. dollar, or 90.98 cents, at Monday&amp;#039;s close.    The currency was 0.2% lower against its U.S. counterpart after dropping 1.6% on Monday, mostly in response to a stronger U.S. dollar.    &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;ve seen some further weakness in the Canadian dollar as generally the U.S. dollar remains fairly firm,&amp;quot; said Doug Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.    A dwindling supply of U.S. dollars in foreign exchange markets was making them more expensive to buy relative to other currencies.    The U.S. dollar has also regained its status as a safe haven asset, in part due to deteriorating economic outlooks elsewhere in the world, which have weakened other currencies.    &amp;quot;Of course, the big news overnight was the aggressive rate cut by the Australian central bank,&amp;quot; Mr. Porter said. &amp;quot;That has taken another swipe at the Australian dollar, and it&amp;#039;s also ramped up the chatter of possibly wider rate cuts more broadly.&amp;quot;    The Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by 100 basis points to 6.0%, putting pressure on other central banks to lower the cost of borrowing in the face of a possible global recession.    A rise in commodities prices failed to give the resource-linked Canadian dollar a boost as concerns over weakening global demand dominated.    &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re seeing more concerns about the potential for further weakness in commodities markets as the global economy slows further,&amp;quot; Mr. Porter said.    About half of Canada&amp;#039;s exports consist of commodities such as oil, natural gas, gold, and base metals
