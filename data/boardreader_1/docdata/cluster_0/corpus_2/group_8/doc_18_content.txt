Just wondering did any of you get in from the ground floor and purchase Commonwealth bank shares back when they were first floated in 1990?  They sold for $5.40 per share back then and are now valued at $ 54.63 as at close of business 18/05/07.        I purchased quite a substantial amount of Commonwealth Bank Shares back in 1990 and glad that I kept them over the years.  Great value!
