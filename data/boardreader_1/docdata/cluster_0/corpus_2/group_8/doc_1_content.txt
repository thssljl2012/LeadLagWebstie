European shares down sharply Shares are trading sharply lower this morning at major European indices, with London's FTSE off 4%, France's CAC down 3.3% and Germany's DAX lower by 2.7%. Reuters reports that the losses were led lower by HSBC, which tumbled after unveiling a big rights issue, and insurance stocks, which fell after U.S. peer AIG was forced to seek another bailout. At 0905 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 3.2 percent at 696.79 points, trading at six-year lows. The benchmark is down 16 percent so far this year and just 2.3 percent away from a lifetime low hit in March 2003. HSBC fell 10% after announcing a 5 for 12 rights issue at 254 pence per share -a 48 discount to Friday's close- to raise around 12.5 bln pounds ($17.82 bln). Annual profit more than halved and bad debts mounted in the United States. Governments continued to come to the aid of financial institutions brought to their knees by a credit market crisis, with the U.S. government throwing a new $30 bln lifeline to American International Group as the embattled insurer prepared to report the biggest quarterly loss in corporate history.
