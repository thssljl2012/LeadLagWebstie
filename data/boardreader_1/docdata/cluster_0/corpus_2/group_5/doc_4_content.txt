Merrills warning came as oil prices sank below the $44 a barrel on Thursday, the lowest level in almost four years, in spite of dramatic interest rates cuts in the UK, Europe and Sweden.    Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at Merrill Lynch, said his main scenario was for oil prices to average $50 a barrel next year, but warned: A temporary drop below $25 is possible if the global recession extends to China.

Did the article mention how Merrill won&amp;#039;t exist as a separate entity in about a month (their acquisition by Bank of America should be complete soon) because it was basically that or close their doors.
