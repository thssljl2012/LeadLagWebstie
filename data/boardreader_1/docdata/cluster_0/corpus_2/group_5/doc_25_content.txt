Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev has also weighed in, saying the country was ready to work with OPEC on possible oil output cuts.

"Chances for a 2.5 million bpd cut are possible, but that would put increased criticism on OPEC amidst the economic slowdown, so I think the likely cuts are up to 2 million bpd," Kazuyoshi Takayama, Nippon Oil's general manager, told reporters on Friday.
