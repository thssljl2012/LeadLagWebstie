as investors alarmed by a deteriorating financial situation dumped blue-chip stocks to raise cash, sending several indexes tumbling down to multi-year lows. 'It's not just the hedge-funds, everybody is selling ... And there are no buyers,' said Dale Tsang, managing director at Imperial Dragon Asset Management Co. in Hong Kong. 'There is a state of panic, for cash. Everybody needs cash.' 'No, I haven't seen anything like this, and I don't think anybody has seen anything like this before, except those who are over 75 years old and have seen the Great Depression,' Tsang added. Japan's Nikkei 225 Average tumbled the most to close 952.5 points, or 9.4%, lower at 9,203.32 for its worst single-day percentage drop in 21 years. The broader Topix index lost 8% to 899.01. Both benchmarks declined for a fifth straight session. Toyota (TM) stock lost 11.6% as shares of exporters were assaulted in the wake of a strengthened yen. The stock was also hurt by a Nikkei business daily report that the company's operating profit in the current financial year ending March 31 is expected to tumble 40% to about 1.3 trillion yen ($12.6 billion) as a deepening financial market turmoil hurts demand for automobiles. Other exporters also shrank, with Sony (SNE) tumbling 12.3% and Nintendo (NTDOY) plummeting 11.1%. Hong Kong's benchmark index fell below its two-year lows, shrugging off the central bank's decision to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, a move designed to encourage banks to lend more actively to each other.  'I think the basic problem here is of confidence. We don't lack in liquidity, but most banks are keeping the available funds for themselves and not lending to others. That is what is happening everywhere in the world,' said Y.K. Chan, strategist at Phillip Capital Management. The Hang Seng Index finished 8.2% lower at 15,431.73, for its biggest single-day percentage loss since January 22, and its lowest finish June 14, 2006. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell 8.3% to 7,731.68. Every single constituent of both indexes ended in the red. The decline came even after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Wednesday said it will cut the base rate -- the interest rate at which it lends to banks through its discount window -- by one full percentage point to 2.5% from Thursday, amid 'stressful conditions in global financial markets.' 'Central banks are applying the right medicine to the credit markets and are in the process of breaking a vicious cycle, but it's not broken yet,' said Howard Gorges, vice chairman at South China Brokerages in Hong Kong. 'People are waiting for further government action on possible recapitalization of banks.' The losses came after a sell off on Wall Street, as investors found little respite even after the Federal Reserve announced it would buy unsecured commercial paper in an effort to restart a market that has virtually shut down in recent weeks and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke opened the door for a possible interest-rate cut soon. In Taipei, the Taiex tumbled 5.8% to 5,206.40, its lowest level since July 2003. China's Shanghai Composite gave up 3% to 2,092.22, while Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 fell 5% to 4,388.10, a day after a higher-than-expected one percentage point cut in interest rates by the country's central bank lifted the index 1.7%. South Korea's Kospi lost 5.8% to 1,286.69, New Zealand's NZX 50 index gave up 1.9% to 2,948.31 and Singapore's Straits Times index lost 6.4% to 2,037.84 by late afternoon. India's Sensitive Index, or Sensex, tumbled 4.3% to 11,203.94, recovering a little after dropping as low as 10,740.76 during the session. Trading in Jakarta was halted for the day after the benchmark JSX Composite fell more than 10%. This is the second time the index dropped more than 10% this week. The benchmark was last down 10.4% at 1,451.67. Katarina Setiawan, head of research at Kim Eng Securities in Jakarta, said that in addition to the sell off in the U.S. and regional markets, a quarter-point increase in interest rates by the Indonesian central bank on Tuesday 'worsened sentiment.' 'Everybody is selling. Mutual funds are selling their portfolios as well,' she said. 'But I don't think there will be any further rate hikes, because the central bank also needs to boost the economy.' In the financial sector, shares of Mizuho Financial Group (MFG) slumped 7.7%, HSBC Holdings (HBC) lost 2% and National Australia Bank (NABZY) gave up 6.4% amid fears the global credit-market crisis is worsening. Resource stocks and shipping companies lost ground, fearing declining global demand for commodities. BHP Billiton (BHP) fell 5.7% and Rio Tinto (RTP) lost 7.6% in Sydney. Shares of Cnooc (CEO) slumped 14.3% in Hong Kong, while commodity trader Marubeni Corp. (MARUY) gave up 11.9% in Tokyo. Among shipping companies, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines lost 12.8% in Tokyo and STX Pan Ocean Co. dropped 12.5% in Seoul and 13.6% in Singapore trading. -- V. Phani Kumar
