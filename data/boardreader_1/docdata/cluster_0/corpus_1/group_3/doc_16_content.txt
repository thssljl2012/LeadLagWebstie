That led investors to unwind risky carry trades. The Aussie was at 55.75 yen , not far from a record low of 55.11 yen struck late last week.* In the U.S. housing market, one of the root causes of the global crisis, sales of newly constructed single-family homes rose in September and inventories shrank, according to new government data. [ID:nN27319783]* The Aussie might have been supported by central bank intervention in Europe. Dealers said the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was buying the Aussie at around the $0.6060 level. A RBA spokesman said he had no information on the buying of Australian dollars during the European session.* The RBA earlier on Monday confirmed it had intervened in foreign exchange markets on Friday and in Asian trade on Monday to provide liquidity to forex markets.* Commodities were slightly higher, taking a breather from a recent savage sell-off. Australia is a major exporter of resources so recent steep falls in commodity prices augur ill for the economy.* Three-year bond futures were indicated 0.05 points lower at 95.67, while the 10-year futures contract shed 0.035 points to 94.885. U.S. Treasuries fell as the start of a government programme to support the commercial paper market sapped some of the safe-haven buying.* But Australian bill futures continue to price in around 100 basis points of easing by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) by year-end.
