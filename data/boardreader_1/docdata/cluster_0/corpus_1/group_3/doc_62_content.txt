(AsiaPulse via COMTEX) -- ATKEF   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- As world markets dived and the local share market opened more than three per cent lower, the mood at the Australia Stock Exchange was not all grim today.Shortly before the market opened at 10am (AEDT), a small crowd had gathered at the exchange in Bridge Street, Sydney.With more than 25 years experience in the game, one man who did not want to be named, was focusing on BHP Billiton (ASX:BHP) shares.'I'm a buyer. I'm glad to see this happening,' he said.Opening at $A29.36 ($US20.82), compared with 'nearly $50 in May', he did not feel the need to act fast.'You don't have to be in a rush to buy this sort of stuff,' he said.'They'll be there tomorrow.'A man sitting next to him was also interested in taking advantage of mining shares.'If you buy mining stocks at the present level, two years from now there is no doubt in my mind they will double, provided the Australian dollar stays low,' he said.Fred Lauseggar, a 67-year-old semi-retired mining engineer, described current activity in world financial markets as 'mayhem'.'It is terrible, mayhem, total madness,' he said.'I think it will take a while to recover. In the last 10 years I have seen a few 'corrections', but none of them as severe as this.'Mr Lauseggar said he had shares in 10 companies, including AMP, BHP and the Commonwealth Bank.Another man who did not want to be named described the market as 'psychotic'.'It was nothing to do with logic,' he said.He thought it was crazy shares could be bought without sellers knowing who owned them.'If I buy $1 million worth of BHP shares, I haven't got a clue who I'm buying them from. Why should this be so? It makes it easier for our broker friends to turn over money,' he said.Don Devine, from Hobart, in Sydney on holiday with his wife, said he was not concerned about whether banks would pass on any cuts the Reserve Bank made to the official interest rate today.That is because Mr Devine and his wife have shares in the Commonwealth Bank, down $1.00 this morning to $43.00.'That's not too bad, compared to others,' Mr Devine said.AAPFor full details for ATKEF click here.More News:  Market Updates   Stock Alerts   All Trading News   Stock Index
