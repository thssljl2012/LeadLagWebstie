If the Footsie drops to 4000, NSAM would probably be in rights issue territory, adds Arden.'While the debt repayment is not due until 2012, with other companies renegotiating ahead of time to guard against having to refinance during even worse debt market conditions, we believe NSAM may consider an early refinancing.'This is unlikely to pan out as a problem for the wider sector. It is just that NSAM has more debt than other asset managers following the 365million return of cash to shareholders in June 2007.One of those is chairman John Duffield, who, at the last count, owned 17.6million shares, or almost 7 per cent of the company.
