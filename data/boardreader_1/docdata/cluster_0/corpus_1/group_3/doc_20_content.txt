The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has confirmed it bought more Australian dollars today in the second intervention after it entered the foreign exchange market during Friday night's offshore session. 'We have provided more liquidity today into a illiquid market,'' an RBA spokesman said.The RBA intervened on Friday night, buying Australian dollars overseas because the market was illiquid. The spokesman said the central bank was not defending any key level in the Australian dollar, which fell to 60.55 US cents on Friday night for the first time since April 2003.The currency also fell to 55.10 Japanese yen during offshore trade, its lowest point since the end of World War II.More interventions seenThe RBA spokesman said the central bank would intervene again if trading conditions were illiquid.Asked if the RBA would intervene in the market again, he replied: 'If the market is illiquid we will be doing the same''.Some analysts said the RBA would continue to intervene to try to calm the market for Australian dollars and shore up confidence in the local currency. 'The RBA has a good history of of providing liquidity during period of erratic price movements in the Aussie dollar and I do not see the last action as more than that,'' said Robert Rennie, chief currency strategist at Westpac.Treasurer Wayne Swan said the decline in the Australian dollar could bring some benefits to the economy, providing some relief to exporters and the tourism industry.That would be some cushion to the economy as signs point to a slowdown, economists said. 'It's generally positive for companies because a lot of our exports are priced in U.S. dollars,'' said Eric Betts, equities strategist, Nomura Australia. 'So it will offset some of the impact of the commodity price slump. It will also help the manufacturers because they compete with imports. It will also help inbound tourism.''The central bank last intervened in the currency market in August 2007, in the early days of the credit crunch, and in 2001, when the Australian dollar was worth less than 50 US cents.AAP, Reuters
