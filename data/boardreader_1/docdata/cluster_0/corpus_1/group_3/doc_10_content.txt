Leading shares in London were volatile again yesterday, although the FTSE 100 managed to recover from early losses to end the day in positive territory. SABMillers shareholders were in a particularly buoyant mood, toasting the rise in the index amid talk that the brewer may expand soon. The company, along with Heineken, its Dutch rival, is thought to be among the leading contenders to buy the beer business of Fosters, the Australian drinks group. SABMiller is regarded as the favourite, given that it has the rights to the Fosters beer brand in the United States and that Heineken is unlikely to splurge further after its debt-funded acquisition of Scottish &amp;amp; Newcastle. Speculation about the future of Fosters has been rife since the company announced a strategic review. It tried and failed to sell its wine business and is believed to be considering a sale of its beer division. SABMillers shares climbed 32p to 10.86p. The FTSE 100 rose 83.68 points to 4,902.45 as traders hoped that the US Governments $700 billion (394 billion) bank bailout plan may yet be passed. The City breathed a sigh of relief. After the House of Representatives rejected the plan on Monday night, many had forecast another bloodbath yesterday. Instead, dealers held their nerve as President Bush vowed to get the package through Congress. However, it was a mixed session for banks. HBOS was the heaviest blue-chip faller, down almost 14 per cent, or 19.6p, to 122.4p amid speculation that its takeover by Lloyds TSB, up 9p to 226p, could require repricing. Other heavyweight banks clawed back bigger losses from earlier in the session but still closed lower, with Barclays losing 7p to 326p and Royal Bank of Scotland shedding 2p to 179p, despite advising investors that its acquisition of ABN Amro assets would not be affected by the forced sale of a stake by Fortis, a bid partner. Icap, the interbroker dealer, led the index, up 65p to 355p, amid positive broker comments after a trading update on Monday. Retailers fared well, helped by strong first-half results from the supermarket giant Tesco, up 17.7p to 387.6p. Kingfisherrose 3.4p to 131.7p, boosted by Investec analysts, who raised their target price on the stock. Wm Morrisonwas up 11p to 258p. Miners also made ground, recouping losses, with Xstrata rising 138p to 17.16 and Rio Tinto gaining 161p to 34.71. Enterprise Inns, up 21p to 178p, led the FTSE 250 after the pubs group said that it would meet full-year earnings and dividend expectations, despite worsening trading. The group said that it was funded to 2011, although it delayed its planned conversion to real estate investment trust status because of turmoil in the financial markets. The second string welcomed Spice, the utility services group, which replaced Detica, the business and technology consultancy. Spice, down 1p to 106p, raised 50 million to underpin its expansion. New York: Shares on Wall Street rebounded amid expectations that lawmakers on Capitol Hill would salvage the rescue plan for the financial sector. However, the credit markets showed no sign of relief. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,850.70 points, up 485.20.
