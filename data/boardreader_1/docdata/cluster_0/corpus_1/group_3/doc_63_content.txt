snapping a four-day plunge as investors temporarily halted their frantic selling to see whether the government's sweeping economic bailout can stem a widening global downturn.Light, sweet crude for November delivery rose $2.25 to settle at $90.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier trading as high as $93.02.Prices had lost nearly $13 in the past four trading sessions as a widening economic crisis spreads overseas and undercuts energy demand forecasts.Despite Tuesday's modest advance, analysts said crude's fundamentals suggest prices are headed lower. 'We've just seen a huge shift in sentiment where the focus isn't on supply anymore. It's on demand, and that demand continues to weaken,' said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy consultancy Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Ill.At the pump, crude's general downward trend continued to weigh on retail gas prices.A gallon of regular gasoline in the Bradenton-Sarasota-Venice market was selling for $3.559, down 1.8 cents from the previous day, AAA reported. Nationally, gas prices fell 2.4 cents overnight to a new average of $3.48.Crude's modest gains came as investors trickled back into the oil market a day after growing financial worries weighed down markets across the globe.Tensions eased some after the Federal Reserve announced an emergency plan to buy up massive amounts of companies' short-term debt in its latest effort to unclog jammed credit markets.Oil market investors are looking for signs that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may cut production if prices fall further. Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Hossien Nozari on Saturday called on fellow OPEC members not to pump too much oil in a bid to keep prices above $100.However, OPEC may be reluctant to slash output since higher gasoline and heating costs would be a further drag on economic growth. 'I think it's very difficult for OPEC,' said David Moore, commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. 'With the international economy looking weak, decisions to support oil prices have to be balanced against not making the situation worse.' A stronger dollar has also been pressuring oil prices lately. The greenback weakened slightly Tuesday, helping send prices higher.Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.
