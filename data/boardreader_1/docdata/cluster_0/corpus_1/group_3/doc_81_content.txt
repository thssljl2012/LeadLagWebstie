The Australian dollar recovered slightly today after its weekend thrashing but was still well below Friday's close as investors sold higher risk assets on ongoing fears about a global recession.At 5pm, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6119/26, down from Friday's close of $US0.6388/94.During the day, the local currency moved between a late afternoon low of $US0.6073 and $US0.6250.Since hitting a post-float high of 98.49 US cents in mid-July, the Australian dollar has depreciated 37%.In Friday night's offshore session the Australian dollar fell to 60.60 US cents, its lowest level since April 15, 2003 when the currency hit 60.30 US cents.ABN Amro currency strategist Greg Gibbs said the ongoing fears about a global recession kept battering the confidence in markets, with investors selling riskier assets such as equities and high-yielding currencies.In Australia, equities markets continued their slide with the All Ords closing at its lowest since October 27, 2004, while the S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 closed at its lowest since November 2, 2004.Worries about a possible global recession kept placing pressure on the Australian dollar, Mr Gibbs said. 'It seemed to be following the yen gyrations, the gyrations in the equity markets,'' Mr Gibbs said. 'We have come off a bit this afternoon at the same time as equities came off in Asia.''On Friday night, the Australian dollar slumped to a post World War II low of 55.10 yen. The domestic currency closed today at 57.09/16 yen, down 6.3% from Friday's close.Over the past 72 hours the Reserve Bank of Australia has twice acted in foreign exchange markets by buying Australian dollars during Friday night's offshore session and again today. 'We have provided more liquidity today into a illiquid market,'' a RBA spokesman said.Today's action was only the fourth time the central bank had intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the local currency since 2001.Mr Gibbs said the RBA intervention has presently halted the currency from falling significantly further. 'They have achieved stability to a degree,'' he said.Confidence has not returned to the currency, however, Mr Gibbs said. 'There is no great sense that the central banks are in command.'' With little data out tonight, Mr Gibbs said the Australian could stay above 60 US cents, where it has not been below since early April, 2003. 'You might presume we might hold above 60 us cents with a little bit of help from central banks,'' he said.AAP
