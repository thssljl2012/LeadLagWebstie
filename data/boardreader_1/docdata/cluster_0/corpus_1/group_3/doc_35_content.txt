NEW YORK, LONDON - Copper's losses deepened in late business Wednesday, slumping by 10 per cent as stock markets tumbled and fears of recession gripped the complex, spurring additional deleveraging in the industrial metal.London Metal Exchange copper for delivery in three months closed down at $4,160 (U.S.) per tonne against $4,500 on Tuesday. In after-hours trade, it fell as far as $4,040 a tonne, its lowest level since November, 2005.The metal, used in power and construction, has more than halved from a record high of $8,940 a tonne in July.Copper for December delivery fell further in after-hours trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex division to as low as $1.8060 per pound, after it had closed 7 per cent lower at $1.8655. There's no sign of a bottom, said David Rinehimer, director of Citi Futures Perspective in New York. It's moving closely with the equity markets. That's the way the price pattern has been lately ... equities go down a lot, copper goes down. U.S. stocks tumbled for a second straight day on Wednesday as disappointing profits and outlooks from a raft of companies compounded fears of a global recession.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 514.45 points, or 5.7 per cent, to 8,519.21. The equities are reflecting investor sentiment and the general economic outlook, Mr. Rinehimer added.Gayle Berry, an analyst with Barclays Capital said rising copper stockpiles in London warehouses added to the negative sentiment about demand.Copper stocks in LME warehouses rose 1,850 tonnes to 207,750  about 90 per cent above the lows for this year seen in May and accounting for just over four days of global consumption. It's still a story about dollar strength, said Frank McGhee, head metals trader with Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.The dollar soared to a two-year high against the euro and a five-year high against sterling . Metals are priced in dollars, and a stronger dollar makes it more expensive for holders of other currencies.The prices of some metals rallied to record highs this year, and seemed immune to the credit crunch that began to take its toll on other markets last year because demand in China appeared intact, analysts say. But that seems to have changed. Demand from China was a big driver and now the momentum in terms of demand is coming down very quickly, said Ashok Shah, chief investment officer at London &amp;amp; Capital. Growth in China  the world's biggest consumer of copper  is slowing, and data this week showed soft industrial production and a fall in GDP growth to 9 per cent in the third quarter from above 10 per cent.The world's biggest miner BHP Billiton warned Chinese demand was set to weaken, although it showed little sign of trimming output. China has not been immune to the global slowdown, BHP said. We expect volatility and uncertainty to continue in the short term. China is also the world's biggest buyer of aluminum scrap, used to produce aluminum alloy, and scrap merchants were defaulting on and delaying imports of contracted scrap, traders said.Aluminum plummeted to $1,976 per tonne, its lowest since November, 2005, and ended at $2,002 against Tuesday's $2,080. Lead fell almost 9 per cent or $120 to a low of $1,250 a tonne  the lowest since September, 2006, and ended at $1,260/1,261 from Tuesday's $1,370.Zinc shed $25 to $1,140 a tonne and earlier it touched $1,118  the lowest since December, 2004, and nickel fell to $10,000 from $10,700/10,705.Tin lost 6.4 per cent to $11,510, its weakest since January, 2007, before closing at $11,550, down $750.
