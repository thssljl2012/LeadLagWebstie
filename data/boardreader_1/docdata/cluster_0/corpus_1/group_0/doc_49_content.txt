 HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Japanese indexes overcame early weakness to end higher Monday, snapping a long streak of weaker finishes as investors looked for bargains in exporters such as Canon Inc. and banks like Mizuho Financial Group. The Nikkei 225 Average finished 0.9% higher at 13,360.04, after dropping as low as 13,169.55 earlier in the day. The gains mark the benchmark's first advance in 13 sessions; it lost nearly 8.5% in the previous 12. The broader Topix index added 1.2% to 1,312.80, logging its second advance in 13 sessions. The rest of the region was mostly higher, with Chinese stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong rising sharply after Industrial &amp;amp; Commercial Bank of China and China Merchants Bank gave strong profit alerts last week. Beaten-down airline stocks rose on bargain buying. Sydney stocks ended lower as banks dropped on persistent concerns about global credit markets, while a pullback in crude-oil prices hurt resource stocks. China's Shanghai Composite surged 4.4% to 2,787.52. The spike helped the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jump 3.4% to 11,611.06 in Hong Kong afternoon trading, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 2% to 21,861.02. Castor Pang, strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial, said the bounce in Hong Kong and Shanghai came on the back of 'oversold' stocks. 'Investors were expecting the (Chinese) central government to rescue the markets, but the government has refrained from interfering in the market,' said Pang. 'Whether the rebound can be sustained will depend on what investors do now. If they dump their shares on the bounce, the rebound will stop.' Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 1.6% to 5,002.50 and South Korea's Kospi inched up 0.1% to 1,579.72, bouncing off the day's low at 1,560. Singapore's Straits Times Index rose 0.8% to 2,916.63 and Taiwan's Weighted index added 0.6% to 7,271.17. India's Sensitive Index, or Sensex, gained 1.2% to 13,618, while the broader S&amp;amp;P/CNX Nifty advanced 1.4% to 4,072.60. Trading volumes were thin in many regional markets in the absence of cues from U.S. markets, which were closed Friday for a holiday. Regional detail Shares of Canon (JP:7751: news, chart, profile) (CAJ:CAJNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) jumped 1.5% and Honda Motor Co. (JP:7267: news, chart, profile) (HMC:HMCNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) rose 0.8%, overcoming early declines. The advance was supported by a weakened yen. In Asian currency trading, the U.S. dollar bought 107.54 yen, compared with 106.72 yen late Friday. Financial sector shares also rallied, with Mizuho Financial Group (JP:8411: news, chart, profile) (MFG:MFGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) advancing 6% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (JP:8316: news, chart, profile) climbing 3.6%.

Among airlines, Air China and China Eastern Airlines Corp. soared by their daily limit of 10%. Both stocks have sunk nearly 65% so far in 2008, despite Monday's gains.
