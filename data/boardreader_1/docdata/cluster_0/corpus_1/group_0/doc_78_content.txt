 HOUSE and unit sales have fallen to their lowest level in nine years as the impact of interest rate rises and high fuel and grocery prices hit.National residential sales volumes data from RP Data shows sales slipped below 40,000 for the three months to March.Unit sales were below 20,000 during the same period.RP Data national research director Tim Lawless said the slowdown was no surprise considering the US sub-prime meltdown, sharemarket collapse and local inflationary pressures.During the boom times of early 2001, almost 100,000 properties were changing hands every quarter.In the second quarter of last year, 86,241 houses and units changed hands.Mr Lawless said buyers had been slow to capitalise on what he described as prime buying conditions in the residential market.And he does not expect to see a rush of buyers entering the market any time soon.'There would need to be a dramatic improvement in market confidence and economic conditions,' Mr Lawless said.'Most importantly, we need to see a levelling in inflation which will offer some certainty as to the direction interest rates will take.'However recent moves by banks to raise interest rates independently of a Reserve Bank increase is likely to bring even more nervousness to the housing sector.Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive Ralph Norris said yesterday there was still a risk of future 'out of sequence' increases.Brisbane agents say the local property market has subdued demand with last weekend's auction clearance rate at 24 per cent.Premium residential specialist Mikki Finlay said prices at the prestige end of the market had dropped 10 to 20 per cent from last year.And with up to three times as many properties on the market than a year ago, many were being shopped from agent to agent in a bid to find a buyer.'There are a number of top-end properties languishing in the market,' Ms Finlay said.
