 The Rudd government says it is committed to boosting competition in the banking sector, as well as strengthening Australia's international standing as a financial services hub.Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan today met banking industry representatives ahead of a financial services hub summit next Thursday.In a joint statement, Mr Rudd and Mr Swan said the summit would examine the strengths of the financial services sector, as well as barriers to its growth.The federal government welcomed the Australian Bankers' Association's support for its commitment to positioning the nation as a financial services hub, the statement said.The Rudd government is committed to strengthening Australia's place as a financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region, and has already announced a range of initiatives to enhance the financial services industry in Australia.In the ... budget we announced a significant cut in the level of withholding tax from a non-final rate of 30 per cent to a final rate of 7.5 per cent on certain distributions from Australian managed investment trusts to foreign resident investors - giving Australia one of the most competitive tax regimes in the world.Also discussed at today's meeting was the fallout from the global credit crunch and the impact it was having on Australia.The ongoing tightness in credit markets recently prompted commercial banks to raise their mortgage rates independently of action by the Reserve Bank.Mr Swan said he acknowledged the pressures placed on borrowing costs as a result of the global credit crunch, but said the banks should be mindful that hard-pressed families would likely reward institutions that provided relief when possible.Australian Bankers' Association chairman John Stewart said there was good reason for accelerating the development of the nation's financial services sector.Mr Stewart, also the chief executive of National Australia Bank, said boosting Australia's reputation as a financial services hub could yield benefits for the entire economy.... as one of the few countries with mandatory superannuation contributions, Australia has developed some of the most sophisticated funds management practices in the world, Mr Stewart said.We should look to export these services for the benefit of Australia's economy - particularly to take advantage of the projected growth in demand for financial services within fast growing economies of the Asia-Pacific region.
