 By Rob TaylorCANBERRA, July 8 (Reuters) - Australian business confidence fell to its lowest in seven years in June, but any expectations of a cut in interest rates to help with the latest sign of an economic slowdown could be premature after the government raised the country's minimum wage.A survey on Tuesday showed businesses gloomy amid falling profits and sales, adding to a series of weak data that is pointing to the top of a rate hike cycle that has taken Australian rates to a 12-year high.But the central bank has been reluctant to start easing in the face of the slowdown because inflation remains near the highest in 17 years, and Tuesday's 4 percent increase in the minimum wage could delay rate cuts even more, economists said. 'What it does is, it makes the time before rate cuts longer. We are probably at the peak rate and it's a question of when they cut now,' said Matthew Johnson, senior economist at ICAP. 'When wages advance faster than productivity, it puts pressure on margins, and hence inflation. A 2 percent rise would've been in keeping with productivity, and would not have put further pressure on margins.' In the latest sign businesses are finding the going harder, the National Australia Bank's (NAB) overall business conditions index shed 7 points in June to 0, the worst monthly outcome since late 2001 and well below last October's record peak of 20.The survey also showed business confidence fell 5 points to -9 in June, the lowest since September 2001. Confidence was down almost everywhere except among big miners. 'Overall, the survey finds a broad-based slowdown in domestic activity and a still subdued and volatile export performance,' said Jeff Oughton, head of Australian economics at NAB.WORKERS TO COST MOREEmployers will now have to pay more for some workers after the government raised the minimum wage by A$21.66 ($20.62) a week, more than the A$13.30 a week rise employers had sought but less than the A$26 unions were looking for.The ruling means workers must be paid at least A$543.78 from October for working 38 hours. 'It is a decision that takes into account the state of the national economy and the circumstances of low paid Australians,' Australian Fair Pay Commission Chairman Ian Harper said in a statement after announcing the decision in Melbourne.The decision will impact Australia's wage price index, as wages have been rising at a healthy clip given the once-in-a-generation resource boom fuelled by rampant Chinese energy demand, and have put upward pressure on inflation.Data in May showed wages were 4.1 percent higher in the March quarter of 2008, from the same quarter in 2007, with the public sector lagging behind the private sector.The wage figures have been behind the Reserve Bank of Australia keeping interest rates unchanged at 7.25 percent even as the economy slows, and the minimum wage rise is unlikely to alter that scenario.Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chief Executive Peter Anderson said wage rises would be passed on by businesses to consumers, further fuelling cost of living pressures from inflation and mortgage payments.The next piece in the to-cut-or-not-to-cut interest rate jigsaw puzzle will be official employment data due on Thursday.Analysts expect 10,000 new jobs were added in the month, recouping some of May's surprising 19,700 drop, which had been the first fall in employment in 19 months.Any disappointment in those figures could see rate hikes discounted.The futures market CSRBA1Y=CSAU is pricing in about a 16 percent risk of a quarter percentage rate rise in the next 12 months, down from around 50 percent at the start of the week.
