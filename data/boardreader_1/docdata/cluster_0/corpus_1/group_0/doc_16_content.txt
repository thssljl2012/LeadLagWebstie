 HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Australian retail sales climbed at a faster-than-expected pace in May, defying expectations that consumers would curtail spending in view of higher interest rates and surging prices for daily necessities. Sales rose 0.7% from April on a seasonally-adjusted basis, rebounding from a 0.1% contraction that month, according data released by the Bureau of Statistics Wednesday. The result beat consensus estimates for a 0.2% rise. Spending on recreational goods rose 2.2%, marking the largest increase among sectors tracked. Spending on food rose 1%, while hospitality and services climbed 2.4%. Spending on household goods fell 1% and department store sales were down 0.8%. 'Anecdotal evidence from major retailers indicates that the May strength in these categories is temporary,' Lehman Brothers economist Stephen Roberts wrote in a research note. Roberts noted the sales figures for May, albeit stronger, remain within a softening trend that's been in place since the end of last year. Other government data released Wednesday showed building approvals fell 6.5% from April. Economists were expecting a 3% decline. Analysts said the decline in homebuilding permits reflects the effect of higher mortgage rates since the middle of last year. The Reserve Bank of Australia left its short-term interest rate target unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25% Tuesday, as expected. Lehman Brothers said the accompanying statement by the RBA showed a slightly less hawkish tone, but was largely unchanged from the previous month. The broker forecast the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged for several months. Chris Oliver is MarketWatch's Asia bureau chief, based in Hong Kong.
