 Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd and fellow major ANZ Banking Group Ltd have ramped up their benchmark mortgage rates just days after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said there was no need to lift official rates.Commonwealth, the nation's biggest home loan lender, on Friday hiked its standard variable home loan rate 14 basis points to 9.58, while ANZ announced a few hours later it will lift its home loan rate 15 basis points to 9.62 per cent.The announcements, which follow similar rate hikes from St George Bank Ltd last week and the smaller BankWest this week, may end up doing the RBA's work for it, especially if the remaining major banks follow. Friday's rate announcements, which are effective from July 14, confirm banking analysts' warnings this week that the big lenders again facing increasing costs of funding and may pass on higher lending costs to consumers independently of any move by the RBA.Not surprisingly the latest bank hikes prompted a flurry of chest-beating in Canberra, with Treasurer Wayne Swan saying that working families were already hurting from eight consecutive interest rates rises in just over years and higher petrol prices. 'Now is the time for families to look for a bank that can best shield them from the increased cost of borrowing flowing from the US sub-prime crisis,' Mr Swan said. Unfortunately home owners are running out of options as many non-bank mortgage writers are already out of the market.The other big banks - Westpac and National Australia Bank - have confirmed their rates are under review.And increasing numbers new home buyers have already dumped the property dream for now, at least. This week's housing finance figures showed home loan approvals had fallen for the fourth straight month.Finance approvals for owner-occupied housing have now fallen by 25 per cent in the first four months of this year.Commonwealth Bank group executive for retail banking services, Ross McEwan, said the bank's own cost of funding was more than 100 basis points above the levels that were being experienced before August 2007 - without including any of the increases by the RBA.Analysts at major brokerages this week noted that banks' wholesale funding costs are again marching upwards after coming down from a peak earlier this year.JP Morgan analyst Brian Johnson noted ANZ banking Group Ltd's $2 billion debt issuance this week was a mighty 238 basis points over the bank bill swap rate (BBSW). 'Despite the rhetoric increasingly acknowledging the impact of the global credit crunch had further to run, banks were surely thinking that the worst was behind them,' Mr Johnson wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.Mr Johnson said he expected the banks would move quickly to reprice their business book as their corporate customers' facilities fell due.Analysts at Credit Suisse noted funding costs were again deteriorating and advised their clients to go underweight in the banking sector. 'Currently, however, we estimate the majors are only recouping 50 to 60 per cent of additional funding cost pressures,' they said. 'As such, we see the potential for further mortgage repricing across the sector.' Last week, the RBA left official interest rates unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25 per cent.Following the RBA board meeting on July 1, bank governor Glenn Stevens noted that conditions in international financial markets remained difficult and credit concerns had resurfaced in the past month. 'The evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs is working to restrain demand,' Mr Stevens said. ANZ Banking Group Ltd has lifted its standard variable mortgage rates by 15 basis points.From July 14, the bank's standard variable rate home loan will be 9.62 per cent.
