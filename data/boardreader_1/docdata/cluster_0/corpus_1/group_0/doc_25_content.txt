 * Iran tensions continue to lend supportSINGAPORE, July 22 (Reuters) - Oil pared some of the previous session's gains on Tuesday, as Tropical Storm Dolly looked likely to miss major U.S. oil and gas production, easing fears of supply disruptions from the first big storm threat of 2008.Forecasters still expected Dolly to grow into a hurricane before hitting land near the Mexican border later this week and said it could threaten some coastal refineries later in the week, limiting the extent of crude's losses.U.S. light crude for August delivery fell 67 cents to $130.37 a barrel by 0105 GMT, after gaining more than $3 a barrel on concerns over Dolly in the previous session. London Brent crude fell 56 cents to trade at $132.05 at the same time.Growing tensions over the health of the U.S. economy due to the housing crisis and rising fuel costs last week pressured oil prices, sending crude down more than 12 percent from this month's all-time peak above $147 a barrel.On Monday, concerns that Dolly could affect oil production from the Gulf of Mexico buoyed crude futures. News that Shell had been flying workers from platforms in the western Gulf of Mexico since Sunday also helped push prices higher.Dolly, which sustained winds of nearly 50 miles per hour (85 km per hour), emerged from the Yucatan Peninsula over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.The world's top oil consumer, the United States, has largely escaped the past two Atlantic hurricane seasons, with just one hurricane -- Humberto in November 2007 -- making landfall on its coasts.But it was pummeled in 2004 and 2005 when a series of powerful hurricanes, including Katrina, ravaged Florida and the U.S. Gulf Coast.Tensions over Iran's nuclear enrichment programme also continued to lend support, further limiting crude oil's downside potential. 'Oil markets are nervous that diplomatic tensions centred on Iran's nuclear programme could flare again,' commodity strategist David Moore at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note to clients.U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned Iran on Monday that it faced more sanctions if it defied a two-week deadline to agree to curb its nuclear programme.Major powers on the weekend gave Iran two weeks to answer calls to rein in its nuclear programme or face tougher sanctions after talks ended in a stalemate despite unprecedented U.S. participation.China, the world's No. 2 oil consumer, in June posted only a modest 3.2 percent increase in imports of crude oil, but it bought record amounts of diesel, the General Administration of Customs said, confirming earlier data.Surging demand from emerging economies such as China and India have fueled a sixfold rise in oil prices since 2002, but concerns over flagging demand in the United States and other large consumers have helped temper gains.
