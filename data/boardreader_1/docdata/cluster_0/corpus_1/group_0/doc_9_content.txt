 A MOTORING group's prediction of petrol prices falling as low as $1.20 a litre is unrealistic, analysts say, but drivers could soon see a 20 cent fall at the bowser.Crude oil prices have fallen about $US20 over the past eight days on the back of weakening tensions in the Middle East and a lack of refinery mishaps.NRMA president Alan Evans today suggested petrol could go as low as $1.20 in the coming weeks if fuel companies passed on the savings.'The price of crude oil's come down $20 just over the last two weeks and we haven't seen it reflected at the bowser yet,'' Mr Evans told the Nine Network.'If oil keeps going down we may well get back to see prices in the $1.20 range which would be a miracle and a relief for all of us.''CommSec chief equities economist Craig James said such a prediction was unlikely to eventuate.He said the average unleaded price could fall by 20 cents, bringing the average back to around $1.43.'We could see prices lower than that in the discounting cycle,'' Mr James said.National Australia Bank energy economist Gerard Burg told motorists to be patient, saying the price drop would come but not one as significant as that predicted by Mr Evans.'Not a real lot has fundamentally changed in the oil market,'' Mr Burg said.He said the overnight drop of $US4 per barrel was attributable to Tropical Storm Dolly bypassing vital oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico on its way to Texas.Petrol prices in the major capital cities remained static or slightly down today with Melburnians paying the most at 157.8 cents per litre on average for unleaded.In Sydney the average was 155.7, Brisbane 147.3, Perth 156.6 and Adelaide 150.7.The renewed debate on petrol comes in the wake of an NRMA-funded study warning Australia has already reached the peak of oil production and must start to seriously develop a renewable fuel industry.'Oil production in Australia has already peaked,'' warns the group's report, A Roadmap for Alternative Fuels in Australia.'Meanwhile, Australia's demand for petroleum is increasing at a rate of 2 per cent a year, from 750,000 barrels per day currently to 800,000 barrels by 2009/10.''
