SYDNEY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Australian stocks are set to fall on Monday after the Dow Jones dropped to a six and a half year low at the end of last week on fears the U.S. government may have to nationalise some big banks. Share prices of Australia's top banks are likely to suffer because of the poor sentiment on financial firms. Resource firms are also likely to decline after a fall in oil and base metals on Friday. March share price index (SPI) futures gained 3 points to settle at 3,365.0, a 37.4-point discount to Friday's 3,402.4 close in the underlying benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index . Companies reporting earnings on Monday, the first day of the busiest week for reporting, include BlueScope Steel, Virgin Blue and Fairfax Media. Other companies reporting this week include Oz Minerals , Suncorp-Metway, AGL Energy, Asciano , Babcock &amp; Brown, IAG, Origin Energy , Westfield and QBE Insurance.
