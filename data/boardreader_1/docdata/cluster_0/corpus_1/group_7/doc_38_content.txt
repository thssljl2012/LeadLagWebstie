NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday as investors snapped up shares of banks and insurers on hopes that a rescue plan for the financial sector would spare shareholders, while higher oil prices underpinned the energy sector.  The market was anxiously awaiting the Obama administration's bank rescue plan, which Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is expected to unveil on Tuesday. The announcement was postponed from Monday to enable lawmakers to focus on the stimulus package, which remains bogged down in the Senate.  Bank of America shares rose 13 percent to $6.94, while the KBW Bank index climbed 3.3 percent. 'The big positive from the confidence standpoint is that we're not going to go down the road to nationalization,' said Alan Lancz, president, Alan B. Lancz &amp; Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio. 'The focus is on Capitol Hill, what they come up with tomorrow.' The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.03 points, or 0.12 percent, to 8,290.62. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index added 3.46 points, or 0.40 percent, to 872.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.96 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,592.67.  Regional banks were another standout, with Huntington Bancshares climbing 24.2 percent to $2.92. Among insurers Hartford Financial climbed 21.7 percent to $15.44.  In the energy sector, Chevron Corp gained 2.2 percent to $49 as U.S. front-month crude climbed 4.2 percent, or $1.66, to $41.82 a barrel.
