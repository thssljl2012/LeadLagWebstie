TOKYO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent in see-saw trade on Tuesday, falling from earlier highs on a firmer yen and as uncertainty about a U.S. bank rescue plan kept investors on their toes.   The benchmark Nikkei added 15.51 points to 7,984.54, after rising as much as 2 percent at one stage.   The broader Topix gained 0.4 percent to 782.30.
