(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock average was down 1.8 percent on Friday, after briefly touching its October bear market low, dented by bank shares on worries about their European peers, while exporters largely failed to benefit from a weak yen.  Jittery investors also pushed the broader Topix index to 741.42, a level that would mark its lowest close in 25 years.  Bridgestone Corp (5108.T) sank nearly 7 percent after forecasting a bigger-than-expected slide this year as it grapples with weak demand and a stronger yen, while Seven &amp; I Holdings (3382.T) dropped on news that its Seven-Eleven convenience store chain was being investigated by regulators. 'The biggest problem is that there are very few buyers in the market. Risk tolerance of global investors is falling,' said Takashi Kamiya, chief economist at T &amp; D Asset Management. 'Even though countries like Japan and the United States are expanding their government spending, consumer demand hasn't followed due to heavy consumer debt, and that will prevent the economy from a full-fledged recovery.' The benchmark Nikkei .N225 shed 132.53 points to 7,425.12, after falling to as low as 7,405.14, its lowest intraday level since 6,994.90 hit on October 28. The Topix slipped 1.4 percent.  Although the dollar stayed within striking distance of a six-week high of 94.47 yen hit on trading platform EBS the previous day, exporters failed to receive much help.  Investors usually welcome a weaker yen as it boost exporters' profits when repatriated, but some market players warned the weaker yen this time was a symptom of broader problems amid growing worry about Japan's economy.  Data on Monday showed the economy suffered its worst quarterly decline since the 1974 oil crisis. 'This time, the weaker yen isn't a good thing. It's part of a broader 'sell Japan' trend,' said Masayoshi Yano, senior market analyst at Meiwa Securities.  Japanese banking shares fell, with top lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T) shedding 2.5 percent to 428 yen and No.2 Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T) retreating 4.1 percent to 188 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T) slipped 1.5 percent to 2,985 yen. 'The market is now worried about the economic situation in Eastern European countries such as Poland and the health of their banks, and then the implication for other European banks that had made loans to those banks,' said Kamiya at T &amp; D Asset Management.  Exporters also slid. Electronic parts maker Kyocera Corp (6971.T) lost 3.2 percent to 5,810 yen and industrial robot maker Fanuc Ltd (6954.T) declined 3.9 percent to 6,130 yen.  Shares of Bridgestone lost 6.7 percent to 1,260 yen after the world's top tire maker posted an 86 percent fall in quarterly operating profit and forecast a bigger-than-expected slide this year as it grapples with weak demand and a stronger yen. Seven &amp; I shares gave up 6 percent to 2,125 yen after the Asahi newspaper said the Fair Trade Commission is investigating whether Seven-Eleven, in violation of antimonopoly regulations, pressured franchise stores not to mark down daily food items such as boxed meals that were near their expiration dates.  In a statement, the company said that the FTC was investigating and that the retailer was cooperating fully. But T&amp;D Holdings (8795.T) bucked the trend, soaring 11.3 percent to 2,190 yen after the insurer said it would raise 69.8 billion yen ($741 million) through a new share issue to boost the capital of its life-insurance units.
