The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.05 points, or 1.09 percent, to 7,270.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index dropped 8.24 points, or 1.07 percent, to 764.90.

Reuters Messaging: rodrigo.campos.reuters.com@reuters.net  1731 ET 25Feb2009-Fear gauge down as S&amp;P 500 support holds ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The CBOE Volatility Index, the implied volatility measure of the S&amp;P 500, was off 1.80 percent to 44.67. The VIX moved lower for the second straight session, breaking below the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, toward the two-month supporting trend line, said Scott Fullman, direcetor of derivative investment strategy at WJB Capital Group. The index, which measures implied volatility/risk premium, is heading back toward the lower end of the recent short-term trading range. 'Technical oscillators are negative and the short-term directional momentum indicators are nearing a negative signal,' he said. The fact that the S&amp;P support level held just below 750/760, has limited some of the upside in spot VIX. Thus, the 38-52 range appears fitting with price action. Actual volatility levels remain in the high thirties; and this also adds a 'floor' of sorts to the VIX, said Larry McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp in a note.

'The history of bubbles shows quite definitively that consolidation is inevitable across a broad range of industries, Bernstein wrote in a note on Wednesday.  'Financial markets are unlikely to respond positively until programs are put in place that attempt to manage that inevitable process rather than attempt to stop it.'

In February 2008, comparable sales rose 2.2 percent.  Only one sector is expected to post growth in the month, the discount group, which is expected to see same-store sales rise 1 percent. However, the positive growth in the sector is due to Wal-Mart Stores, the country's largest retailer. When Wal-Mart's results are excluded, the discount sector is expected to see comparable sales drop 2.2 percent. Total same-store sales for February are expected to tumble 6.5 percent when Wal-Mart is excluded.  Among the other sectors, apparel retailers are expected to see same-store sales fall 10 percent while teen and child apparel retailers post a decline of 9.4 percent in comparable sales.
