HONG KONG, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares are expected to be flat after a four-day rally, ahead of the unveiling of the U.S. rescue plan for debt-stricken banks.  Investors will also await the release of key economic data, including inflation and loan growth for January, said analysts.  Chinese stocks, which have advanced sharply in recent sessions, helped by a week-long rally on the Shanghai-bourse, may come under pressure as investors start to question the sustainability of bull run in the Chinese markets.  Resources stocks may pullback following strong gains on Monday as oil prices fell with U.S. crude dropping below $40 a barrel on demand worries.  But yet another big move on the global dry bulk freight index, up 10 percent, will support further gains in shipping stocks.  The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI finished Monday 0.8 percent higher at 13,769.06 in its longest rally in two months.
