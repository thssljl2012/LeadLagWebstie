The Australian sharemarket has opened over four per cent higher following strong gains on Wall Street as the US government bailed out troubled banking giant Citigroup.  London also recorded record gains as the British government released a STG20 billion pound ($A47.05 billion) stimulus package to help Britain recover from recession.

CMC Markets analyst David Taylor said the Citigroup bailout had improved investor sentiment in the financial sector.'It's one of the world's biggest banks, so it's given the market a sense of security,' Mr Taylor said.'With that sense of security, there are a lot of bargain hunters jumping into the market. In London, the FTSE had its biggest percentage gain on record, so a lot of bargain hunters are getting in there because a lot of these stocks are undervalued.'Strengthening commodity prices again were propping up resources stocks, he said.  Woodside Petroleum gained $3.33, or 11.07 per cent, to $33.40, Santos rose 83 cents, or 6.38 per cent, to $13.83 and Oil Search lifted 24 cents, or 5.37 per cent, to $4.71.

Making news on Tuesday, Qantas has lowered its annual profit forecast and will again cut capacity, as the global financial crisis constrains demand for air travel.  Qantas shares lost one cent to $2.30.  Virgin Blue shares were up 0.5 cents to 36.5 cents.'The management (at Qantas) have said that, by cutting back, they'll be in a good position to increase capacity when demand improves,' Mr Taylor said.'That's their strategy moving forward. If it works, great. If it doesn't work, then not so great.'
