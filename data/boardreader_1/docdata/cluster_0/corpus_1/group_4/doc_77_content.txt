)  10-YR BOND (DEC) 95.105(+0.075) 4.90(4.99)  3/10 SPREAD +1.115 (+1.135) AUST/US 10-YR SPREAD +137(+133)  S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 3452.2 (3523.2) US10-YR 3.53(3.66)  __________________________ Nov 19______________________________  DATA: New vehicle sales dropped 0.5 percent in October, the  fourth straight month of falls leaving sales down a sharp 10.6  percent for the year. Still, the monthly drop was not as bad as  many had feared and nothing like as weak as in the U.S.  _______________________________________________________________  * The Australian dollar drifted lower on Wednesday as Asian  shares failed to follow a rally on Wall Street, and investors  cautiously awaited speeches from top central bankers here.  * RBA Governor Glenn Stevens speaks on 'The Economic  Situation' at 8:35 p.m. (0935 GMT). He is preceded by Assistant  Governor Malcolm Edey speaking on 'The Economy in Late 2008:  Conditions and Prospects' at 2:50 p.m. (0350 GMT).  * Analysts are hoping for guidance on how much they might cut  interest rates at the December policy meeting, though events are  moving so fast that the comments might have a short shelf-life.  * The bill market is already pricing in a cut of at least 75  basis points in the 5.25 percent cash rate, and further drastic  easing to 3.5 percent next year, so it might be vulnerable to a  pullback if the governors are less than outright bearish.  * The Aussie was hovering around $0.6457, having  backed off an early $0.6521 high as the Nikkei eased  despite a late bounce on Wall Street.  * Support seen around $0.6350 and the possibility of more  intervention from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is putting  a floor under the currency for the moment.  * Aussie also edges down to 62.30 yen, from an early 63.34  high, but support seen around 61.75 yen.  * Overall, sentiment remains bearish on the Aussie given the  prospect of global recession -- there were more dismal housing  data out of the U.S. on Tuesday -- and the  expectations of more aggressive rate cuts here.  * Australian bond futures traded firmer, buoyed by a strong  performance from U.S Treasuries which saw two-year yields touch  their lowest levels since 2003.  * Three-year bond futures rose 0.050 points to  96.220, while the 10-year contract added 0.075 to 95.105.
