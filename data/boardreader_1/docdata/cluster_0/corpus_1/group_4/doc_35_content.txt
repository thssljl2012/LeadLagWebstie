dollar was weaker at noon as a dive on Wall Street to five-year lows and a record fall in US inflation kicked risk-driven currencies.  At 1200 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6395/99, down half a US cent, or 0.8 per cent, from Wednesday's close of $US0.6444/49.  During the morning, the local unit moved between an opening high of $US0.6455 and a low of $US0.6360, a 1.7 per cent range.  The Australian dollar opened marginally firmer but fell below $US0.6400 within the first hour of trade as a close on Wall Street confirmed key New York indices had fallen to their lowest levels since March 2003.  The local unit's low point of $US0.6360, hit after 0830 AEDT, was only a tenth of a US cent above the level of a week ago, when the Reserve Bank of Australia intervened in the foreign exchange market.  This morning's low point was still 5.8 per cent above late October's five and a half year low of $US0.6012, but a whopping 35.4 per cent below mid-July's 25-year high of $US0.9849.  Risk appetite took a hit on Wednesday night after new data showed US inflation in October had posted the biggest monthly fall on record.  A US Federal Reserve board member said the US was at risk of deflation.  HiFX senior consultant Derek Mumford said the Australian dollar had taken direction from the slumps on Wall Street. "The Aussie is very much following the equity market," Mr Mumford said. "We saw the Dow down five per cent: we fear the worst." The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 5.07 per cent, to below the key 8,000 level, and the broader S&amp;amp;P 500 lost 6.12 per cent, with both indices falling to their lowest level since March 2003 on Wednesday night New York time.  Mr Mumford said the Australian dollar managed to climb closer to $US0.6400 in late morning trade because the local share market had fallen by a less dramatic three per cent at noon. "The Aussie is holding up well given the bad news," he said. Adding to fears of a global economic slowdown was US consumer price index data showing a record one per cent fall during October.  This was the biggest monthly slide since the US Labour Department series began in 1947.  US Federal Reserve vice chairman of the board of governors, Donald Kohn, said the US was at risk of deflation.  Mr Mumford said the Australian dollar was likely to trade within a tight range today, with big moves in the currency likely during the European and US sessions on Thursday night.  At 1200 AEDT, the Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index (TWI) was at 53.6, down from Wednesday's close of 53.9.  Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was firmer at noon.  At 1200 AEDT, the yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 4.775 per cent, down from Wednesday's close of 4.840 per cent, while the yield on the June 2011 bond was at 3.665 per cent, down from 3.730 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December 10-year bond futures contract price was at 95.215, up from Wednesday's close of 95.155, while the December three-year contract price was at 96.310, up from 96.255.
