Article from:   The Australian  LOCAL stocks closed sharply down on concerns over the banking sector's exposure to troubled firms and expectations for capital raisings.  The S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 fell 146.9 points, or 3.58 per cent, to 3960.9, the first time that the benchmark index has closed below 4000 points since October 29.  The broader All Ordinaries was down 138.2 points at 3921.8.  In the currency market, the Australian dollar was buying US67.16c, after trading between US66.94 and US67.27. It closed at US68.48c yesterday.  Investors were also rattled by a 60 per cent fall in struggling transport group Asciano in the first 17 minutes of trading today, before it was placed in a trading halt.  Citigroup analysts issued a sell recommendation on Asciano and said the company needed to raise around $2.1 billion to reduce its debt levels.  A negative lead from Wall Street and a record low reading for business confidence in October for Australia contributed to the downbeat mood in the market.  The results of National Australia Banks monthly business survey showed that confidence fell 21 points to minus-29, the lowest level since the survey began in 1997, as conditions dropped 10 points to minus-11.  Mining heavyweights were also sharply lower as euphoria over Chinas $855 billion stimulus package announced over the weekend gave way to some profit-taking.  Major Asian markets were mostly lower as investors doubted that Chinas stimulus package would be able to prop up the economy there and the rest of the region. Other investors took profits.  Tokyos Nikkei 225 was down 2.15 per cent, after earlier having fallen more than 4 per cent, and Hong Kongs Hang Seng was slightly lower by 0.59 per cent in afternoon trade.  In Australia, the financial sector tumbled 3.45 per cent amid concerns that more lenders would follow National Australia Bank in launching discounted capital raisings to shore up balance sheets.  Macquarie Private Wealth division director Lucinda Chan said: It never bodes well when a company raises capital because of share dilution.  Investors also remained cautious towards the banks after they admitted to having lent several hundred million dollars to ABC Learning Centres and Allco Finance Group, now in the hands of receivers.  Citigroup analysts also downgraded their recommendation on Commonwealth Bank, the countrys biggest lender, to a sell, from hold.  The economic environment now looks set to deteriorate further, and CBA faces relative headwinds in terms of credit quality and wealth management earnings, a Citigroup report said.  NAB plunged $2 (9.03 per cent) to $20.15 after it raised $3 billion in a discounted institutional placement yesterday.  Commonwealth Bank shed $2.39 (6.29 per cent) to $35.61, Westpac lost 61 cents (3.06 per cent) to $19.30 and ANZ gave up 22c (1.38 per cent) to $15.68.  Basic materials, including resources, fell 3.86 per cent as BHP Billiton fell $1.09 (3.65 per cent) to $28.80 and Rio Tinto dropped $1.51 (1.94 per cent) to $76.49.
