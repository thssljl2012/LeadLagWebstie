SYDNEY, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of Australia's index of commodity prices slid in October when measured in special drawing rights, but rose sharply in Australian dollar terms as the currency tumbled.   The RBA's index fell by 5.1 percent in special drawing rights terms to 253.4, following a 0.7 percent rise in September. The largest contributors to the fall in October were decreases in the prices of copper, wheat, nickel and aluminium.   In Australian dollar terms, the index jumped by 9.5 percent in October to a record high of 229.3. The local dollar plunged in October lifting the value of commodities priced in U.S. dollars even as those prices fell.
