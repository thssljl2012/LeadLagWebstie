MELBOURNE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Australian shares sank 3.9 percent on Thursday, as several companies highlighted clouds hanging over their earnings prospects and falling oil and metal prices weighed on resources companies. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation's second-largest lender, led the banks down, falling as much as 6 percent to a nearly four-year low after warning it expected a big rise in bad debts this year. 'Anything is taken as bad news these days. There's very little treated as good news,' said Austock Group strategist Michael Heffernan. He said the bank's update was not dramatic but had raised concern among some investors about the prospects it would have to raise more cash, following a A$2 billion share sale last month. 'Other people take it very badly and say they're going to have to raise some capital, do a placement or a rights issue,' he said. Top global miner BHP Billiton was the biggest drag on the market, sliding 7.7 percent to A$26.12. Rival Rio Tinto was down 4.7 percent at A$71.69. Woodside Petroleum fell 5.3 percent with other oil and gas producers. By 0003 GMT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index was down 154 points at 3,773.3, after slipping 0.9 percent on Wednesday. New Zealand shares fell 1.3 percent to 2,736.7, weighed down by a 2.5 percent fall in Telecom Corp of New Zealand.
