Singapore, Nov 18 (AFP) Oil prices made slight gains in Asia today after falling around two dollars on worries over a deepening global financial crisis, dealers said.  New York's main futures contract, light sweet crude for December delivery, rose 19 cents to USD 55.14 a barrel. The contract dropped USD 2.09 to 54.95 at the close of floor trading Monday at the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Brent North Sea crude for January delivery gained 19 cents to USD 52.50. In London Brent yesterday fell USD 1.93 to settle at USD 52.31.  David Moore, a commodities strategist with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney, said there was no fresh news to move the market today.  'It's really just the tail from what happened in last night's trading,' he said.  The oil market remains preoccupied by worries about the international economy and its impact on oil consumption, Moore said.  Concern for slowing global economic growth and its impact on energy demand has led oil prices to plummet from record peaks above USD 147 in July.  The oil market on Monday digested news that Japan's economy slipped into recession in the third quarter, while American banking giant Citigroup announced massive job cuts.  The bank said it would slash an additional 50,000 jobs worldwide to cope with a global financial crisis and heavy losses.  Energy demand is already falling in the US, the world's biggest oil consumer, and announcements like that from Citigroup add to the economic fears, analysts said.
