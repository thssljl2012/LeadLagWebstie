AUSTRALIAN shares surged more than 5 per cent today after a barrage of bad economic news boosted chances of a deep rate cut tomorrow.  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index closed up 203.5 points, or 5.1 per cent, to 4221.5 after the market spiked 1.5 per cent in the last few minutes of trading as a large buy portfolio was pushed through the market.  The broader All Ordinaries was up 206.6 points at 4273.2.  Expectations for a 50-basis-point interest rate cut tomorrow increased after the release of data on retail sales, house prices and job ads that was much worse than expected.  Lower interest rates reduce the attractiveness of a countrys currency, but can help boost economic growth.  Investors were also comforted by last weeks rally in US shares of more than 10 per cent, compared with a near 4 per cent gain in local stocks, which marked the end of one of the worst monthly performances in decades.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.6 per cent on Friday, for its first two-session gain since September, though it was down 14 per cent for the month.  The Australian dollar was trading higher at US68.3c this afternoon, as Asian markets strengthened and investors covered their short positions.  Some traders had oversold the currency ahead of the release of this mornings data. The Aussie traded between US66.75 and US68.45c after closing at US67.11 on Friday.  The Dow futures contract was up 110 points this afternoon, pointing to a positive start to the new month, though this will depend on the quality of the ISM manufacturing index and construction spending data to be released later today.  ANZ senior economist Katie Dean said: Todays data suggests the Australian economy could be slowing more sharply than expected and should provide further reason for the RBA to cut official interest rates by 50 basis points at tomorrows board meeting.  Retail sales had their biggest fall in three year years in September, while house prices recorded their biggest quarterly drop so far this century, in the September quarter.  The number of job advertisements in October had their sharpest decline in 10 years.  Capping the barrage of bad numbers, the TD Securities-Melbourne Institute monthly inflation gauge rose by 3.9 per cent in the 12 months to October, the first time headline annual inflation had been under 4 per cent since January.  Market heavyweights in the mining and banking sectors pushed the local market higher on the first trading day of November.  BHP Billiton rose $1.91 (6.8 per cent) to $29.90 and Rio Tinto gained $4.40 (5.7 per cent) to $82 even after commodity prices fell on Friday night.  Among the four largest banks, ANZ jumped $1.14 (6.6 per cent) to $18.50, Westpac rose $1.19 (5.9 per cent) to $21.47, Commonwealth Bank advanced $1.54 (3.8 per cent) to $41.84 and National Australia Bank was up $1.11 (4.6 per cent) at $25.10, ahead of the expected rate cut of 0.5 per cent tomorrow.  Even Caltex, which warned that the unprecedented fall in the Australian dollar and commodity prices had hurt its 2008 earnings outlook, was higher by 67c (7.1 per cent) at $10.06.  ABN Amro Morgans investment adviser Bill Bishop said traders welcomed the strong start to the month after a shocking performance in October.  Its nice to see practically everything green on the screen, said Mr Bishop.  Everyone is terribly keen to see the market go up.  A public holiday in Japan shifted the focus to other markets in the region.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained more than 5 per cent and South Koreas Kospi Composite was up nearly 2 per cent after the Government announced it would boost fiscal stimulus by KRW11 trillion and likely cut taxes by KRW3 trillion to spur economic growth.  Singapore's Straits Times index were also riding high, up nearly 5 per cent, while Taiwan shares were up almost 2 per cent.
