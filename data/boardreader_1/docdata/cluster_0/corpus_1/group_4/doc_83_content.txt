Australian stocks have tumbled in early trade after Wall Street plunged overnight on fears that the US car industry could collapse.  In recent trading, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index fell as much as 1%, or 35.8 points, to 3463.8.  Yesterday the index was down 0.7%, at 3499.63 while the broader All Ordinaries index shed 0.9%, to 3483.23, bringing its loss to 50% from its highs of about a year ago. On Wall Street the Dow sold off sharply at the end of the session, taking the index down 426.99 or 5%, to 7997.76 and bringing it under 8000 for the first time since 2003.  Keith Thompson of Shadforth's said he expects the Australian market to lose at least 150 points today.  After dropping under the 3500 yesterday, today's overseas lead will pull the the S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 lower, he said.  ''The market is trying to find a bottom,' he said. 'But anytime we get to a theoretical bottom something else seems to hit us.''  ''Everyone would like the market to go up but there is no catalyst for it,'' Mr Thompson said. ''Everyone is looking for a catalyst.''  The Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index fell 52.54 points, or 6.12%, to 806.58, and the Nasdaq stumbled 96.85, or 6.5%, to 1386.4.  Leaders of the big three US automakers testified in Congress, spurring fears that the industry could fail which would deliver another blow to the US - and global - economies.  Adding to the gloom, policy makers from the US Federal Reserve revised their estimates for the gross domestic product in the US. GDP growth will be minus-0.2% to 1.1% next year, compared with the 2% to 2.8% growth they had predicted in June, the Fed said.  The Aussie dollar was weaker overnight after Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens warned against excessive pessimism combating efforts to stoke growth by the central bank and the Federal Government. (See story here.)  The dollar lost eight-tenths of a US cent, or 1.3%, to buy 64 US cents in early trade.  Mr Thompson downplayed the possibility of a the RBA's comments helping the market today because in the current environment, ''it's just day-to-day now.''  The market is pricing in a three-in-four chance of a full percentage point cut to the 5.25% interest rate the next time the Reserve Bank meets, according to Credit Suisse.  A closely watched guide for commodities, the Reuters/Jefferies CRB index, was down 1.8%, indicating mining stocks may come under selling pressure.  European stocks slid, with London's FTSE 100 index fell 202.87 points, or 4.8%, to 4005.68 points, while Germany's DAX sank 225.38, or 4.9%, to 4354.09 points.  In Paris, the CAC 40 lost 129.51 points, or 4%, to 3087.89 points.  In local news today, the Reserve Bank of Australia releases its November bulletin.
