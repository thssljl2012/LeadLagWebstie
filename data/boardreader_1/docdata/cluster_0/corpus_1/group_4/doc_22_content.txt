THE Australian sharemarket has reversed direction after recent sharp losses to end the week more than one per cent higher, following a strong US lead.  The local stock exchange was more than four per cent higher in morning trade but closed around 1.5 stronger, coming off as traders sold into the rally. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 50.8 points, or 1.37 per cent, at 3,748.1, while the broader All Ordinaries index had risen 53.6 points, or 1.46 per cent, to 3,726.0.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 1618 AEDT, the December share price index futures contract was 29 points higher at 3,782 on a volume of 34,366 contracts.   Despite the stronger finish, the big losses mid week took $69 billion from the value of the All Ordinaries index compared with last Fridays's close.   IG Markets research analyst Ben Potter said mining and energy stocks contributed to today's gains, up 2.9 per cent following a rebound in the price of oil overnight. 'Oil gained 3.7 per cent after falling to near 22-month lows of $US54.67 per barrel,'' Mr Potter said. 'This was despite the International Energy Agency lowering its 2008 and 2009 demand forecasts. 'They are now expecting demand to grow by 120,000 barrels in 2008, down from a previously forecast 330,000 barrels.''   Among energy stocks, Woodside was steady at $36.90 after touching an intraday high of $38.92, Oil Search had surged 35 cents, or 7.37 per cent, to $5.10 and Santos had gained 55 cents, or 4.25 per cent, to $13.50.   Mining giant BHP Billiton had jumped $1.40, or 5.6 per cent, to $26.40 and its takeover target Rio Tinto had leapt $3.00, or 4.35 per cent, to $72.00.   Among the banks, ANZ had shed 27 cents to $13.78, Commonwealth Bank had fallen 90 cents, or 2.73 per cent, to $32.10, NAB had gained 39 cents to $19.79 and Westpac had slipped 17 cents to $16.80.   St George shares were down 80 cents, or 3.33 per cent, to $23.20 after its shareholders yesterday approved Westpac's $16 billion-plus merger proposal.
