Market plunge ... Shares fell 6pc to hit 2004 levels and wiping out billions in investments. Share market down almost 6pc $57 billion wiped out  SHARES closed down 6 per cent today, wiping $57 billion off the market after Wall Street tanked overnight on growing fears of global recession.  By the 4.15pm close, the ASX 200 had shed a massive 230 points to close down almost 6 per cent at 3697, a level not seen since October 2004.   The broader All Ordinaries also lost more than 200 points, closing 5.4 per cent lower at 3672.   The market fared even worse than Wall St, which plunged 5 per cent overnight after the US Government said it would not buy bad mortage assets from banks, and moved to rejig the bailout plan.   Local shares fell sharply at opening bell, down more than 4 per cent within the first fifteen minutes, and never recovered.  IG Markets researcher Ben Potter said the bear market was entering a new phase. 'There are simply not enough buyers to support prices, let alone see them move higher,' Mr Potter said. 'Rather than excessive selling driving prices lower, markets seem to be falling under their own weight.' Macquarie Equities adviser Helen Spencer said the weaker lead from the US and Asian markets dragged down Australian equities. 'The market is down across the board, with both the industrials and the resource sector trading lower,'' Ms Spencer said. 'Oil prices slumped again overnight, down heavily to 22-month lows and that's seen that sector substantially weaker today.''Commonwealth Bank of Australia came out today with an update for the market, and certainly their outlook was somewhat negative to what the market had been anticipating and that certainly didn't help the financials.''   Commonwealth Bank shares dropped almost 6 per cent to $33.00 after it said it expected to write off more bad loans because of the economic slowdown.   Other banks also fell. NAB shed 2.6 per cent to $19.40, Westpac was down 11.2 per cent to $16.97 and ANZ was more than 8 per cent lower at $14.05.   St George shareholders approved the $16 billion merger with Westpac, but St George shares lost 9.43 per cent to $24.  The plunge also hit resources, with mining giant BHP Billiton down 12 per cent to $25 and Rio Tinto down $6.20 to $69.
