(BizWorld)   Oil extended gains above USD 58 in overnight trading, after climbing almost 4 percent yesterday.   The latest rises come as a recovery in equity markets countersincreasing signs of a global recession and slowing demand.  Expectations that OPEC will output again late this month also lent support, but some analysts said it was premature to conclude that the market had hit a bottom, pointing to high U.S. oil stockpiles and slowing world oil demand growth. Traders in Singapore said this morning that US crude futures for December delivery had risen 33c to USD 58.57 a barrel.  Oil is currently down almost USD 90 a barrel since its record of USD 147.27 in July, and touched USD 54.67 on Thursday, the lowest since Jan. 30, 2007.  London Brent crude for January the new front-month, edged up 27 cents overnight to USD 56.51 a barrel.'I definitely don't agree with the view that oil prices have bottomed out. No one can say where that would be,' said David Moore, commodities strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, adding that the share market rebound in the United States, Australia and Asia as well as the dip in the U.S. dollar aided oil's rise.
