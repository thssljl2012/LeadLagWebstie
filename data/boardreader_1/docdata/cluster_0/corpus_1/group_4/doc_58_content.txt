ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Bill Bishop said the falls on local markets were across the board, following the second daily decline on Wall Street.  'They have gone back to realising Barack Obama cannot save them overnight because he does not get into power for some time,' he said.  'He will do what he can, but this disaster has taken a long time to put together and it's gathering momentum.  'Those who suggested that the bottom had arrived, maybe are possibly rejigging their estimates.'  Mr Bishop said equity markets were paying for firms lowering their debt levels.  'Credit is very tight. People have to sell things without raising money,' he said.  'If they cannot raise money from the banks, they have to sell things.'  Mr Bishop said it was likely local shares would end the day lower.
