SYDNEY, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Australian shares ended 1.2 percent higher on Wednesday, spurred by banks, after billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it would invest $5 billion in U.S. bank Goldman Sachs. Sentiment on the banks also improved after JP Morgan upgraded its rating on top lender National Australia Bank Ltd to neutral from underperform. 'The Goldman Sachs news definitely buoyed the market today, and those sort of names have all rallied pretty hard, having recently been shorted and having underperformed in the last month or so,' said Fortis Investment Partners dealer Simon Twiss. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index finished up 58.4 points at 4,981.9, reversing a 1.9 percent fall on Tuesday. National Australia Bank Ltd jumped 7.3 percent to A$25.60, its highest close in a month. Investment bank Macquarie Group jumped 10.8 percent to A$40.00. 'There is some compelling value around, albeit risks still remain. Given the current risks, the banks are offering a reasonable risk-reward investment at the moment,' said Simon Bonouvrie, a portfolio manager at Platypus Asset Management. The diversified miners fell in early trade after metals prices dropped, but trimmed losses by the end of the day. BHP Billiton Ltd ended down 0.1 percent at A$37.87, while Rio Tinto fell 2.5 percent to A$105.50. New Zealand's NZX-50 rose 1 percent, or 31.5 points, to 3,259.7. Shares in iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group jumped as much as 7.5 percent to A$7.00 after Australia's High Court ruled against BHP Billiton on a case that could lead to it having to share its rail lines with Fortescue. Fortescue shares ended down 0.8 percent tat A$6.46. Paper maker and trader PaperlinX Ltd fell 4.7 percent to A$2.23 after it flagged it might sell new shares to shore up its balance sheet. Department store chain David Jones ended flat at A$4.39 after reporting a 25 percent rise in full-year profit and reaffirming its forecast for 5-10 percent earnings growth in the year to July 2009.
