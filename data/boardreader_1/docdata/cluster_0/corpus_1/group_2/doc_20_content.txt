The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates this month because the slowdown in domestic demand required to lower inflation was 'unfolding', the central bank's September board minutes reveal.The RBA said there was in place 'a necessary precondition for a decline in inflation back towards' its target band of between two and three per cent over the course of the economic cycle.But despite lowering the cash rate by 25 basis points to seven per cent - ending a run of 12 consecutive rate rises - the minutes indicated the RBA was in no great rush to embark on a series of interest rate cuts.The central bank noted the risks of easing monetary policy too soon, given the evidence for the expected fall in inflation was still some time away.'Policy had to balance these risks,' the minutes, published at 1130 AEST on Tuesday, said.'After considering all the evidence, the board came to the view this balance was best achieved by reducing the cash rate at this meeting.'The central bank said waiting too long to ease monetary policy from what it described as a 'quite restrictive setting' could result in demand weakening more sharply than necessary.'This would deliver a faster reduction in inflation, but at greater short-term economic cost,' the minutes said.In its quarterly statement on monetary policy, released last month, the RBA said it expected consumer price index (CPI) inflation to continue to rise over the second half of calendar 2008 before reaching five per cent by the December quarter.The RBA's forecast for the underlying rate of inflation, which is the average of the trimmed mean and weighted median and the central bank's preferred measure, were also increased.It expected underlying inflation to print at 4.5 per cent in the December quarter, up from the four per cent it forecast in May.Although the preconditions for a decline in inflation was now in place, the RBA said 'evidence for that decline would not be seen in the figures for some time' and would depend on continued restraint in wage demands and a softening labour market.'As inflation needed to fall a significant way to be consistent with the target, policy could need to be on the restrictive side of normal for some time,' the minutes said.Commenting on the latest wages data, the RBA said the picture was 'mixed'.It said the 4.2 per cent year-ended rate of growth in the wage price index was in the range of the past few years, there was significant divergence in wage growth within sectors and measures capturing bonuses were running ahead of measures of base pay.Also, measures of wages growth from the average weekly earnings survey had not shown any evidence of upward drift, it said, but acknowledged the series had been highly volatile.'Broadly, wage growth at present was seen as being at the upper end of the range in the inflation-targeting period,' the minutes said.The RBA maintained its previous forecast that underlying inflation was expected to fall back within the target band by the middle of 2010.The CPI rose by 1.5 per cent in the June quarter, for an annual inflation rate of 4.5 per cent.The underlying rate of inflation clocked in at 1.1 per cent in the quarter for an annual rate of 4.4 per cent.
