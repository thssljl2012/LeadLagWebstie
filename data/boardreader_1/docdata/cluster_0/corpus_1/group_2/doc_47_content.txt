The US Federal Reserve's bailout of insurance giant American International Group (AIG) did little to ease the concerns of investors worldwide, who are fretting about the possibility of further collapses on Wall Street. Fuelling concerns were Lloyd's TSB's take over Britain's HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland), which owns BankWest in Australia, for the equivalent of $28.06 billion. Asian markets were deeply in the red, with Hong Kong's bourse down about seven per cent.CommSec market analyst Elvina Simpson said the market had fallen to near three-year lows, dragged down by heavy losses in the finance sector. 'Investors are worried about who will become the next victim of the global financial crisis,'' Ms Simpson said. 'There are rumours Morgan Stanley is in merger talks with Wachovia, America's fourth largest bank. 'Combined with Lloyd's and HBOS, these things are weighing on investor's minds.'' Ms Simpson said investment bank Macquarie Group was savaged, plummeting $7.88, or 23.22 per cent to $26.05, a five-year low. She said National Australia Bank was a poor performer, down $1.10, or 5.31 per cent, to $19.60.

Insurers were lower, with Suncorp-Metway down 51 cents, or 5.76 per cent to, $8.35 and Insurance Australia Group fell 14 cents to $4.02. Ms Simpson said sharp falls in base metal prices dragged the miners deeper into the red. BHP Billiton was 65 cents lower to $35.00, while its takeover target Rio Tinto dropped $3.60 to $98.40.

AIG rescue fails to calm Yesterday's $US85 billion ($107 billion) rescue of insurer AIG by the Federal Reserve failed to calm a crisis of confidence. Fears linger that Morgan Stanley - one of only two big investment banks left standing - may be next in line for a merger. The Dow fell almost 450 points and the Nasdaq fell nearly 5 per cent in its worst day since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 as rattled investors worried about who could be the next victim of the global credit crisis. There were similar falls on Monday night after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. There were also heavy losses on the London, Paris and Frankfurt markets. Who's next? Morgan Stanley shares sank 24.2 per cent overnight to $US21.75 as investors worried whether it would survive as an independent investment bank in the current environment. Shares of the other remaining major US investment bank, Goldman Sachs, dropped 13.9 per cent to $US114.50 and at one point fell below $100 for the first time in more than three years. 'The fear is, 'Who is next?'' said John O'Brien, senior vice president at MKM Partners. 'It almost feels like people scour the books and say, 'Who is the next likely target that we can put a short on?' and that spreads continuous fear.' Trouble spreads to Britain The UK's biggest mortgage lender, HBOS reached a merger deal with its rival Lloyds TSB, British media reported after lender's shares plummeted for a third day running. HBOS - the owner of BankWest - confirmed it was in 'advanced talks' with Lloyds TSB, and the BBC and Sky News later reported that a deal had been struck, saying an announcement was expected early tomorrow. Prior to the reports of the takeover talks, HBOS shares had nosedived 52 per cent to a low of 88 pence, its third successive day of heavy losses. London's FTSE 100 index tumbled 2.25 per cent to 4912.40 points, breaching key technical support at 5000 points as investors tracked Wall Street's heavy losses. In Paris, the CAC 40 lost 2.14 per cent to 4000.11 points and in Frankfurt, the DAX was down 1.75 per cent at 5860.98 points. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 449.36 points, or 4.06 per cent, to 10,609.66, its lowest level since November 2005. It was the blue-chip Dow average's biggest percentage drop since Monday, when it fell 504.48 points, or 4.42 per cent, the most since the aftermath of 9/11. The S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 57.20 points, or 4.71 per cent, to 1,156.39, its lowest level since May 2005 and its biggest percentage drop since September 17, 2001, when the markets reopened after the September 11 attacks. The Nasdaq also fell the most since September 17, 2001. It shed 109.05 points, or 4.94 per cent, to 2,098.85, its lowest level since August 2006. -With the Herald Sun, AFP, Reuters
