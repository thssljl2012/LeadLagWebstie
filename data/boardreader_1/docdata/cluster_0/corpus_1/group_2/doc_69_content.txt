LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - European stocks fell further in afternoon trade on Friday, as banks extended losses amid uncertainty about the U.S. government's $700 billion rescue plan and commodity stocks tracked weaker crude and metals prices. A sharp decline in U.S. index futures also put pressure on European stocks. The futures were down between 1.8 and 2.9 percent. At 1241 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 2.6 percent at 1,195.97 points, having hit an intra-day low of 1,194.49. Pressure mounted on lawmakers to agree on a $700 billion financial rescue plan after talks at the White House broke down in acrimony and the biggest bank closure in U.S. history roiled global markets. U.S. authorities shut bank Washington Mutual Inc on Thursday, selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase. In Europe, Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis denied it had a liquidity problem after its shares tumbled for a fifth straight day. Fortis shares were down 13 percent. Europe's biggest bank, HSBC Holdings, said it was cutting 1,100 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, citing the crisis. HSBC was down 2 percent. Among other banks, Dexia fell 7.5 percent, Lloyds TSB declined 8 percent and Barclays dropped 5.7 percent.
