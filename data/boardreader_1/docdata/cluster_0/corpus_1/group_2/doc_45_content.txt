 SYDNEY, Sept 1 (REUTERS) - The Australian dollar on Monday hovered close to recent 11-month lows against the U.S. currency, which benefited from upbeat U.S. data, while risk aversion saw it dive to a five-month low against the yen. The U.S. currency gained across the board after U.S. consumer confidence rose to its highest in five months in August, while business activity in the U.S. Midwest expanded last month at a far more robust pace than expected as new orders jumped. In contrast, Australia's report on gross domestic product out later this week is expected to show growth slowing considerably as high interest rates and rising living costs crimp consumption. By 9:20 a.m. the Aussie dollar was down at $0.8567/70 against the U.S. dollar, from $0.8622/24 late here on Thursday, not far off an 11-month low of $0.8493 hit late last month. Second-quarter current account and inventories data will be released at 11:30 a.m. (0130 GMT). Analysts expect the deficit to narrow to A$11.9 billion, from A$19.49 billion in the previous quarter and trade is expected to add 0.2 percentage points to GDP. Business inventories are expected to rise at a modest pace of 0.6 percent in the second quarter, slowing from 0.9 percent in the previous quarter. Both data will feed into second-quarter gross domestic product data on Wednesday. A private sector inflation survey will also be released at 10:30 a.m., but is unlikely to sway expectations for a domestic interest rate cut on Tuesday. Markets are pricing in a 25 basis point cut at the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) board meeting, the first cut in seven years. The move will dim some of the Aussie's high-yield allure. Those expectations along with lower Wall Street stocks led investors to pare leveraged carry trade positions, driving down the Aussie to 92.64 yen, the lowest level in five months. Australian bonds were lower, tracking U.S. Treasuries which fell on stronger-than-expected data U.S. data. The prospect of local interest rate cuts, however, offered some support. Three-year bond futures shed 0.025 points to 94.33, while the 10-year bond contract eased by 0.02 points to 94.26.  - bhx   Thomson Financial News Limited 2008. All rights reserved.
