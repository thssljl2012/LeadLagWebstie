 The Australian dollar has closed weaker as traders brace for the first interest rate cut in seven years and faltering share markets in Asia dented demand for high-yielding currencies.At 5pm AEST, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.8537/42, down from Friday's close of $US0.8609/11.The Australian dollar reached its intraday high in the morning and then declined as weaker share markets, particularly in South Korea and Hong Kong, turned traders off high-yielding currencies.'The Aussie dollar, in the absence of other information, can sometimes follow stock market changes,'' Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joseph Capurso said.Economists are universally expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut interest rates tomorrow, from a present 7.25%.This would be the first official cash rate easing since December 2001.Futures markets expect follow-up rate cuts in October and November as a one in two chance.Mr Capurso said the Australian dollar could gain 1 US cent if the RBA signalled in the accompanying monetary policy statement tomorrow that it would not follow up with more rate cuts.'Tomorrow's announcement, it's not so much what they cut but what they say,'' he said. 'That's going to be the biggest mover of the market this week.''Mr Capurso said expectations for a rate cut at 2.30pm AEST tomorrow caused traders to ignore today's healthy balance of payments and business indicator data, both for the June quarter.'People looked at the numbers and didn't know how to react to it,'' Mr Capurso said. 'The terms of trade commodities story is a complex one.''Economists said surging commodity prices caused Australia's current account deficit to narrow by a record 36% in the June quarter.Meanwhile, company gross operating profits surged by 14.3%, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed.With US markets closed overnight for the Labor Day public holiday, traders are expected to take direction from European manufacturing data, also known as the purchasing manager's index.Mr Capurso said a weak result would hurt the Australian dollar if it sparked a sell-off in the euro.
