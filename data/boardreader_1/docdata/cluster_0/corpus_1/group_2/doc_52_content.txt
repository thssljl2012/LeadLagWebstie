WELLINGTON -(Dow Jones)- New Zealand's current account deficit is expected to have widened in the second quarter, hurt by a drought, rising import prices and tighter credit conditions.Statistics New Zealand will issue the data Friday at 10:45 a.m. local time, or 2245 GMT ThursdayThe median forecast is for a deficit of NZ$3.39 billion in the three months ended June 30, according to a poll of nine economists by Dow Jones Newswires. The deficit was at NZ$2.16 billion in the first quarter.The survey also forecasts the deficit for the 12 months to June 30 to widen to NZ$14.18 billion from NZ$13.79 billion in the year ended March 31, or equivalent to 7.9% of gross domestic product versus 7.8% previously. 'Strong imports in 2Q, bolstered by a sharp increase in oil prices along with lumpy one-off capital imports, will see the improvement in the goods balance falter. The investment balance is expected to deteriorate in 2Q,' said ASB Economist Jane Turner.While higher world prices and surging demand have boosted New Zealand's dairy exports over the last year, providing strong support for the country's terms of trade, the economists expect the deficit to continue to widen in the short term. 'The deficit should continue to widen over the rest of the year, before increased dairy production and softer demand for imports set the improvement back on track next year,' said Westpac Bank Chief Economist Brendan O'Donovan, who tipped the deficit is likely to widen beyond 8% of GDP again by year-end before narrowing again through the next year.He said in a climate of market turmoil, a larger-than-forecast deficit would see the New Zealand dollar punished more than it would be rewarded by an equivalent upside surprise. Nervous investors are moving out of marginal currencies like the Kiwi, he said.Forecast % Of GDP Annual 2Q Median 7.9% -NZ$14.18B -NZ$3.39B Previous qtr 7.8% -NZ$13.79B -NZ$2.16B ANZ 7.7% -NZ$13.88B -NZ$3.09B ASB 8.0% -NZ$14.44B -NZ$3.66B BNZ 7.8% -NZ$14.04B -NZ$3.25B Deutsche Bank 7.9% -NZ$14.18B -NZ$3.39B GS JBWere 7.8% -NZ$14.09B -NZ$3.30B FNZC 7.6% -NZ$13.74B -NZ$2.95B Infometrics 8.3% -NZ$14.86B -NZ$4.07B UBS 7.9% -NZ$14.29B -NZ$3.50B Westpac 7.9% -NZ$14.27B -NZ$3.50B -By Rebecca Howard, Dow Jones Newswires; 64-4-471-5990; rebecca.howard@ dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 09-17-082013ET Copyright (c) 2008 Dow Jones &amp;amp; Company, Inc.
