THE share market had moved into the red by noon, dragged lower by the big miners and most of the major banks, while the local market digested news of the agreement reached in the US on the Wall Street bailout.At 12.17pm (AEST), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 was down 20.2 points, or 0.41 per cent, at 4884.6, while the broader All Ordinaries lost 22.4 points, or 0.46 per cent, to 4912.1. The December share price index futures contract was 23 points lower at 4933, on a volume of 13,285 contracts. ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said the market was being dragged lower by the energy and resources sector. 'As far as the large miners are concerned, the falls relate to lower base metal prices'' over the weekend, he said. Mr Walker said the local market, which opened up over 1 per cent this morning, was clearly not convinced by the Wall Street bail out and was focusing on the broader issues facing the US economy. 'This bailout package is obviously a short term fix, but there are other issues which the market is going to have to continue to deal with.'' At 12.18pm AEST, BHP Billiton had lost 65 cents to $35.19, while takeover target Rio Tinto had dropped $3.37, or 3.34 per cent, to $97.63. The financial sector was weaker. Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell eight cents to $44.35, ANZ lost ten cents to $18.90, Westpac reversed 14 cents to $23.84 and its takeover target St George Bank lost 16 cents to $31.34. National Australia Bank picked up 22 cents, or 0.85 per cent, to $26.02. On Friday in the US, financial markets remained on edge after the Bush administration's proposal for a $US700 billion banking bailout ran into opposition from Republican and Democrat congressmen alike. The Dow rose 121.07 points, or 1.10 per cent, to 11,143.13. But broader indicators were mixed. The Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index rose 3.83 points, or 0.32 per cent to 1213.01, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 3.23 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 2183.34.Making news today, retailer Myer Group has delivered net profit for 2008 up almost 40 per cent, and has forecast improved profitability by mid-2010. The unlisted group today reported net profit for fiscal 2008 of $93.579 million, up from $73.432 million in the prior year.

Mr Walker said Incitec's fall followed a forecast by US financial services company Citigroup which said nitrogen-based crop nutrients may extend declines. 'As far as Incitec is concerned, I guess their global peers were weak over the weekend after Citigroup put out a negative forecast on some of the nitrogen-based fertiliser companies,'' he said.
