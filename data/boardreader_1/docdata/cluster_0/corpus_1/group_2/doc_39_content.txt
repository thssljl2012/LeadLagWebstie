Funds are cancelling out positions and there is selling pressure,' says one trader.A fund manager says Jeronimo, which has been under pressure from a depreciating Polish currency in the last few weeks, could fall as low as 5 euros, after which funds could start buying again. About half of Jeronimo's sales are in Poland, where it operates the country's largest network of discount stores.Reuters Messaging rm://andrei.khalip.reuters.com@reuters.net14:05GMT 18Sept2008-Amid financial mkt ructions, quiet diary on Fri-------------------------------------------------------------------0600 German PPIReuters Messaging rm://sitaraman.shankar.reuters.com@reuters.net13:50GMT 18Sept2008-European stocks stay up as U.S. shares recover at open--------------------------------------------------------------------------European stocks are steady, up 0.7 percent, as U.S. shares recover from the recent slump on Wall Street, helped by a coordinated action by the world's leading central banks to inject billion of dollars into global financial markets to soothe the credit crunch.At 1353 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares is up 0.7 percent, at 1,077.85 points.The Dow Jones industrial average is up 1.1 percent, the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 Index is up 1.4 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index is up 1.4 percent.Reuters Messaging rm://blaise.robinson.reuters.com@reuters.net13:26GMT 18Sept2008-Aviva, Pru seen benefiting from weak AIG------------------------------------------------------------Shares in Aviva and Prudential rise 6.7 percent and 3.1 percent respectively in a brighter financial sector with Keefe, Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods seeing both firms benefitting the most from the weakening of the world's biggest insurer American International Group, after the U.S. firm's bail-out this week by the Federal Reserve.Keefe, Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods says it sees Prudential as possibly a big winner of AIG's business in Asia, where it could cherry pick the U.S. firm's sales agents en masse and maybe acquire AIG's Japanese business at an attractive price.Keefe, Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods also sees Prudential benefitting in the United States by selectively buying AIG assets, while in addition a weaker large domestic competitor should help the UK group's life assurance sales.The broker says Aviva should be a net winner as well, benefitting from a number of attractive assets coming up for sale in Asia, while a weaker AIG in the U.S. should help the UK group's fixed-indexed annuity franchise, and Aviva should also benefit from AIG's weaker UK non-life operations.Keefe, Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods says things look good as well for RSA Insurance , with less competitive behaviour likely to be seen from AIG in the UK commercial insurance market, while RSA is also likely to want to acquire some of AIG's Asian businesses at good prices.RSA shares gain 4.7 percent, helped by underlying takeover speculation, although Keefe, Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods says the stock is not cheap.Reuters Messaging rm://jon.hopkins.reuters.com@reuters.netKeywords: MARKETS EUROPE STOCKSNEWStf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomsonreuters.comjlwCOPYRIGHTCopyright Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
