LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - European shares extended losses at midday on Wednesday after U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers reported its third quarter figures. By 1146 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.9 percent at 1,145.70 points, led by banks and miners. 'Not much to cheer about in those numbers but looking at how the (Lehman) shares have recovered in the pre-market right after the numbers, it seems that the news is being viewed positively,' one trader in Frankfurt said. Banks were the top-weighted losers on the pan-European index, with UBS (nyse: UBS - news - people ) losing 1.9 percent, Barclays (nyse: BCS - news - people ) easing 1.4 percent and Santander shedding 2.5 percent. Drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis (nyse: SNY - news - people ) offered some support, rising 6 percent on expectations Chief Executive Gerard Le Fur would be replaced by GlaxoSmithKline (nyse: GSK - news - people ) executive Chris Viehbacher.  tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomson.comvjt   Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
