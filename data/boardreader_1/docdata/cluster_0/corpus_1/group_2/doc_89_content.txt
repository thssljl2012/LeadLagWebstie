The Australian dollar was higher at noon after news of a possible buyout of troubled US investment bank Lehman Brothers spurred a rally on US equities and pushed the currency back above $US0.8000.At 1200 AEST, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.8031/35, up from yesterday's close of $US0.7954/57.During the morning, the local currency traded between a low of $US0.8012 and a high of $US0.8098.The Australian dollar received a boost after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Bank of America may purchase Lehman Brothers.The report caused US equities to surge towards the close of the New York session, lifting with it the Australian dollar.The unit continued its upwards trend at the start of the local session, only to be dragged lower by weaker than expected New Zealand retail sales data.Seasonally adjusted total retail sales fell by 0.8 per cent in July, Statistics New Zealand said today.Suncorp strategic analyst treasury services Peter Pontikis said the New Zealand data capped any further rally for the Australian dollar, which he expected to remain at these levels for the rest of today's local session.Mr Pontikis said the Australian dollar was oversold. 'For all the manic depressive mood swings this currency has had this week from last week, basically not really much changed,' Mr Pontikis said. 'The Aussie dollar is an okay story, I won't say it's brilliant, but it's an okay story.' Mr Pontikis said it would not suit the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to have the Australian dollar below $US0.8000. 'If you look at their most recent statement on monetary policy forecasts, inflation forecasts were based on 91 US cents,' Mr Pontikis said. 'We have some real threats to the medium-term, long-term inflation forecasts if it stays down here. 'You can't expect TWI (trade weighted index) to be at two-year lows and expect no impact on the inflation rate, it will be inflationary.'
