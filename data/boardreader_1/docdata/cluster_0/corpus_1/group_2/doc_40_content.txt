TORONTO -- The Toronto Stock Exchange ended the day in positive territory Friday after a volatile week of trading on uncertain oil prices and jitters about the future of the U.S. financial industry. The Canadian dollar closed at 94.24 cents US Friday, up 1.35 cents, after hitting a 13-month low on Thursday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude for October delivery rose 31 cents to settle at $101.18 a barrel, after briefly sinking to $99.99 as refineries in the Gulf of Mexico battened down the hatches over concern about the impact of hurricane Ike. Crude oil on the futures market briefly sank below the psychologically important US$100-a-barrel mark for the first time since April 2 -- showing that investors believe a worsening global economy will continue to drive down demand for some time in the United States and elsewhere. 'Until you get the hurricane out of the way, until you get some resolution on Lehman Brother, Merrill Lynch, and all the others, you're going to get more of the same (volatility),' said Irwin Michael of ABC Funds in Toronto. 'You have continuing concern about Lehman Brothers... and the other one that we're watching closely is AIG, the big American insurance company. It's overhanging the market and until people know that, there's a lot of concern.' -- The Canadian Press
