LONDON (ShareCast) - London's blue chips closed in the red, but off their session lows, as the $700bn US bail-out plan remained in doubt. President Bush tried to assure the public that a deal would be reached. "We are going to get the package passed," he said in a brief speech at the White House. His plea came the day after negotiations over the passage of the agreement broke down in Congress. Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB, HBOS and Old Mutual were all lower. LSE was also in the red even though it says overall trading remains "good". Lloyds and HBOS were not helped by a note from Credit Suisse raising doubts over the benefits of the former's takeover of the latter. The broker has lowered its rating on Lloyds 'underperfom' and cut its target price to 195p from 220p. It also slashes its target price on HBOS to 165p from 330p. 'The question is whether the disproportionate transfer of HBOS equity to its shareholders, combined with the synergies, offsets the risks," Credit Suisse said. A decline in advertising at Daily Mail and General Trust's local newspaper division prompted JP Morgan to lower its estimates on the media group, while keeping its 'overweight' rating. Confusion over the state of JJB Sports finances sent its share price crashing as it refuted claims that it had breached a bank covenant on a 15m banking facility with Bank of Scotland. Sports Direct was down in sympathy. Hull-based telecoms group KCom's earnings will be cut by 3m due to the failure of Lehman Brothers. 'The failure of Lehman Brothers is expected to result in a reduction to EBITDA of no greater than 3m in the current financial year, it said in a statement. It added that: 'Overall group profitability, before making provision for the item noted below, is expected to be consistent with the comparable six months of the prior year on lower revenues." Regal Petroleum has slashed its first half pre-tax loss to $2.9m from $10m a year ago as Ukraine gas and condensate sales lifted turnover by 3% to $6.7m. Average gas and condensate prices achieved in the period were $193 per thousand cubic metres and $95 per barrel, respectively, versus $142 and $55 in 2007. Oil and gas exploration group Dragon Oil said its executive chairman Hussain Sultan has resigned with immediate effect. He will be replaced by Mohamed Al Ghurair, who has been a non-executive director of Dragon Oil since April 2007. Kids TV group Entertainment Rights said an amendment to its distribution agreement with its primary US DVD distributor will cause a short-term reduction in profits of around 7m in the current financial year and by about 6.5m in the year to end-February 2010.
