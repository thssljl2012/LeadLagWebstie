LONDON (MarketWatch) -- European shares declined on Monday morning, as investors weighed news that the U.S. has agreed details of a financial-sector rescue plan, with bailouts of Fortis and Hypo Real Estate and the nationalization of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley. The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index (ST:SXXP: news, chart, profile) fell 0.8% to 263.92, with financials under pressure again. The U.K. FTSE 100 index (UK:UKX: news, chart, profile) lost 1.6% to 5,007.95, the German DAX 30 index (DX:1876534: news, chart, profile) fell 1.7% to 5,959.71 and the French CAC-40 index (FR:1804546: news, chart, profile) lost 1.4% to 4,104.78. Investors have been waiting for more than a week for details of a U.S. plan to stabilize the financial markets. On Sunday, U.S. congressional leaders released a draft text trumpeting taxpayer guarantees and caps on executive compensation. The draft legislation would authorize $250 billion immediately, with another $100 billion upon presidential certification. A further $350 billion would also be available subject to congressional approval.  'The market reaction to the draft bailout plan is telling . . . the problem is that the plan has been indirectly diluted by the payment in installments and it doesn't help solve the capital issue unless the Treasury pays well over the odds for the assets,' noted Rossa White at Davy Stockbrokers. In the financial sector, shares of Royal Bank of Scotland (UK:RBS: news, chart, profile) were down 3.9% and shares of Barclays (BCS:BCSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (UK:BARC: news, chart, profile) were 3.1% lower. Deutsche Bank (DE:514000: news, chart, profile) , down 2.3%, Commerzbank, down 7.5%, and UniCredit (IT:UCG: news, chart, profile) , down 2%, are part of an investment group that holds a stake in Hypo Real Estate (DE:802770: news, chart, profile) . Hypo Real Estate shares fell 68.9% in Germany after it was bailed out by a consortium of German financial institutions. The real-estate finance firm said it will take a write-down on its Depfa Bank unit and will scrap its dividend. Still, Fortis (BE:000380118: news, chart, profile) shares took back some of last week's heavy losses, rising 1.1% after the group received an 11.2 billion euro ($16.37 billion) injection from the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg Sunday. The rescue makes Fortis the largest European financial institution to be bailed out as a result of the ongoing credit crisis.  News that the U.K. Treasury will nationalize parts of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley (UK:BB: news, chart, profile) after investors and lenders lost confidence in the bank didn't do much to help sentiment. Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley's retail deposit business and branch network are being transferred to Banco Santander's (STD:STDNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) Abbey division, while the remainder, including its mortgage and personal loan books, headquarters and treasury assets will be taken into public ownership. Away from financials and shares of Dutch chemicals firm Akzo Nobel (NL:00913: news, chart, profile) fell 5.9%. It's targeting an EBITDA margin of at least 14% by the end of 2011. Cost management is expected to lead to at least an extra 100 million euros in net cost savings. ICI synergies, combined with these additional net cost savings, will result in a total reduction of 3,500 jobs by 2011, the firm added
