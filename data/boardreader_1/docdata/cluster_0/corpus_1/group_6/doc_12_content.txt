MEXICO CITY -- Latin American stocks inched higher for a second day Friday, buoyed by an interest rate cut in Mexico and another government bailout for a top U.S. bank.  Mexico's IPC index rose 0.2 percent to 20,325 as investors bet the country's first interest rate cut since 2006 might boost its slowing economy. Mexico's central bank slashed its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to 7.75 percent.  Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index gained 0.5 percent to 39,342, despite reports that the government would likely announce on Monday that the economy lost 600,000 jobs in December.  Plans to offer exporters $20 billion in loans, announced by Brazil's central bank president this week, also boosted expectations that policy makers would soon cut Brazilian lending rates. Brazil's currency strengthened slightly to 2.34 to the U.S. dollar.  Investors welcomed news late Thursday that the U.S. government would extend a $138 billion rescue package to Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest bank by assets in the U.S. The bank's shares fell 14 percent on Friday regardless, but some bet the bailout would ease continuing financial turmoil and tight credit in the United States, a top buyer of Latin American exports.  Chile's IPSA climbed 0.6 percent to 2,499, while Peru's IGBVL jumped 1.3 percent to 7,015 and Colombia's IGBC rose 0.1 percent to 7,526. Only Argentina's Merval slipped, falling 0.2 percent to 1,098.
