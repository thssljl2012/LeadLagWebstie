SEOUL, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Seoul shares may trade in a tight  range on Monday as worries about financials weigh on the market  following a bleak set of results from U.S. banks last week, but  modest gains on Wall Street may lend some support.  Financials including KB Financial Group may come  under pressure on fresh worries about the sector after the U.S.  government extended $20 billion of new aid to Bank of America  Corp hours before both the largest U.S. bank, and the  country's third largest, Citigroup reported  multibillion-dollar losses from the ongoing global credit  crisis.  'Today, and in fact throughout this week, the main index will  test the 1,100 support level, with vague expectations about  government support helping sentiment, but economic worries  continuing to weigh on markets,' said Kim Yong-kyun, a market  analyst at Daishin Securities.  Steelmakers may be in focus after Japan's Nippon Steel said on Sunday that it believes the global steel  industry may need two to three years to recover from the current  downturn.  The Korea Composite Stock Price Index finished up  2.15 percent at 1,135.20 points on Friday, up from the low of  1,109.69 points.  ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2244 GMT ------------  INSTRUMENT LAST PCT CHG NET CHG  S&amp;P 500 850.12 0.76% 6.380  USD/JPY 90.96 -0% 0.000  10-YR US TSY YLD 2.3405 -- 0.000  SPOT GOLD 841.85 0.00% 0.000  US CRUDE 36.48 3.05% 0.480  DOW JONES 8281.22 0.84% 68.73  ASIA ADRS 90.01 1.45% 1.29  -------------------------------------------------------------  MARKETS SUMMARY  *Stocks rise on energy gain, financials cut losses  *Oil rises 3 percent on short covering  *Treasuries hit; supply fears weigh amid debt guarantee  *Dollar, yen slide as BoA boosts confidence  STOCKS TO WATCH  LG DISPLAY  The world's second-biggest LCD maker posted a record  quarterly loss on Friday, its first loss in seven quarters, hurt  by heavy U.S. fines over price-fixing charges and falling panel  prices due to weak consumer demand.
