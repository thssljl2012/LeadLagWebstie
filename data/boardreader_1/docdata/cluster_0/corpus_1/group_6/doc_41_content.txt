TORONTO - A strong showing by energy and mining stocks pushed the Toronto stock market higher Friday, but financials continued to be a drag on worries about more big losses in the sector.  New York indexes were mixed as the Dow industrials were driven lower by poorly received earnings reports. Indexes found some support from energy and technology stocks.  Toronto's S&amp;P/TSX composite index rose 141.41 points to 8,627.97 for a loss of 292 points or 3.25 per cent this week, led by sliding financials.  The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 45.24 points to 8,077.56, losing 204 points or 2.45 per cent on the week.  The Canadian dollar rose 1.46 cents to 81.22 cents US as new data showed inflation slowed to the lowest pace in two years last month, thanks largely to falling energy prices. Statistics Canada says annual inflation dipped to 1.2 per cent in December, down from November's two per cent rate.  The TSX Venture Exchange was 9.48 points ahead to 859.69.  The Nasdaq composite index moved up 11.8 points to 1,477.29 while the S&amp;P 500 rose 4.45 points to 831.95.  'The simple fact is earnings are going to continue to be disappointing in the broadest sense of the word,' said John Stephenson, portfolio manager at First Asset Funds Inc.  'And the expectations are still far too high in terms of most analyst expectations for '09 earnings.'  General Electric's fourth-quarter earnings dropped 46 per cent as it restructured its troubled lending arm and warned 2009 will be 'extremely difficult.' GE's results matched analyst expectations but its shares fell $1.45 to US$12.03.  A bright spot was Google Inc. Excluding one-time charges, Google earned $5.10 per share compared with analysts' expectation of $4.95, and its shares rose $18.20 to US$324.70.  Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) rose $1.79 to $41.74 after it raised its dividend by 10 per cent. CN's fourth-quarter profit of $573 million was down from a year ago, but this was mainly because of big gains in the year-earlier period, and the results beat market expectations.  Elsewhere, the biggest maker of flat-screen TVs, Samsung Electronics of South Korea, posted its first-ever quarterly loss, worth US$14.4 million. Samsung's report came a day after Japan's Sony Corp. projected its first annual loss in 14 years and Korea's LG Electronics reported a record quarterly loss.  Copier and printer maker Xerox Corp. posted a profit of a bare $1 million on weakening sales. Its stock faded 56 cents to US$7.03.  Capital One Financial Corp. became the latest financial firm to report weak results. The company, focused on credit cards, set aside US$2.1 billion to cover defaults, and its shares plunged $2.62 or 12 per cent to US$19.32.  The financial industry has been hit hard during a week that has seen triple-digit swings on Toronto and New York market indexes on each of the last three days.  'Bank of America - it's a real question mark if it even survives - Citigroup (is a) disaster,' said Stephenson.  'These companies have imploded and they've imploded in such a stupid and obvious way. I think this is systemic. There's a culture of risk taking, a culture of short-term gain on Wall Street and it's going to take the better part of a generation for that culture to change.'  The TSX financial sector, already down nine per cent this week, was off another one per cent Friday as Royal Bank (TSX:RY) fell $1.99 to $28.08 after an analyst questioned the financial health of the bank. CIBC (TSX:CM) gained 75 cents to $44.  The TSX energy sector was ahead 3.3 per cent as the March crude contract in New York moved up $2.80 to US$46.47 a barrel. Suncor Inc. (TSX:SU) gained $1.18 to $24.10 and EnCana Corp. (TSX:ECA) improved $1.75 to $54.50.  The TSX gold sector climbed seven per cent as the February bullion contract in New York rose $37 to US$895.80. Goldcorp Inc. (TSX:G) gained $2.98 to $36.25 and Barrick Gold Corp. (TSX:ABX) moved up $4.09 to $48.79.  The base metals sector rose 2.75 per cent with Teck Cominco Ltd. (TSX:TCK.B) ahead 32 cents to $5.61.  HudBay Minerals Inc. (TSX:HBM) surged 85 cents or 24 per cent to $4.37 after the Ontario Securities Commission ruled its shareholders must be allowed to vote on its proposed highly dilutive all-stock takeover of Lundin Mining Corp. (TSX:LUN). Lundin shares dropped 27 cents or 23 per cent to 92 cents.  Encryption technology company Certicom Corp. (TSX:CIC) has reached a $92-million deal to be purchased by California-based VeriSign Inc. The deal trumps the hostile bid that BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion (TSX:RIM) was forced to withdraw by an Ontario court order. However analysts say it doesn't keep RIM from returning with a friendly counteroffer. Certicom stocks jumped 67 cents or 40 per cent to $2.34.  The economic slowdown continues to grind along worldwide and Britain now has officially sunk into recession. Output fell 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, the biggest decline since the early days of Margaret Thatcher's government nearly 30 years ago. That followed a 0.6 per cent decline in the third quarter.
