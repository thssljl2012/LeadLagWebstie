 Market watch top headlines Australian reports Aust markets:  :  :  World reports World commodities:  World markets:   RIO, QBE, CNP, CER, WAN, SEV, WPL, WOR, AAQ,   AAP 2009-01-19   Copper surged more than five per cent on Friday as sentiment improved after news of a US government bailout of Bank of America, but demand worries persisted and poor US data pointed to weak demand.  World stocks rallied from the previous day's one-month low as Bank of America will receive another $20 billion in US government cash and a guarantee against almost $100 billion of potential losses on toxic assets after its acquisition of Merrill Lynch.  Copper for three-months delivery on the London Metal Exchange rose 5.2 per cent to a session high of $3,445 a tonne, before closing at $3,355, up 2.4 per cent.  On Thursday, it was last quoted at $3,275/3,280 a tonne after falling 3.5 per cent. 'The Bank of America getting money has lifted sentiment,' analyst Michael Widmer at BNP Paribas said. 'It shows that the US government is serious about making sure that things don't get much worse,' he said. The credit crisis has led to a global economic recession and a sharp drop in demand for industrial metals since mid-2008. 'I'm bearish for the next couple of weeks, I think copper is going to go towards $3,000 a tonne,' an LME ring dealer said.  Copper - often seen as a key gauge for real economic activity - is down more than 60 per cent since hitting a record of $8,940 a tonne in July and is not too far off last year's low of $2,825 on Dec. 24.  Traders said market talk of cutbacks at the world's biggest copper mine Escondida, which is majority owned by BHP Billiton, had been supporting prices.  A spokeswoman at the world's largest miner told Reuters the cutbacks had been announced previously. 'The mine would see approximately 25 per cent output cut in fiscal 2009, which started in July, which amounts to around 370,000 tonnes,' she said. With gloomy expectations for the economy in 2009, the focus swiftly switched back to the macroeconomic picture and metals prices trimmed gains later in the session.  The US Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index dropped 0.7 per cent in December. Data also showed US industrial production falling 2 per cent last month, capping a dismal year for manufacturing.  The American Bankers Association said it expects the US economy to contract 0.3 per cent in 2009.  Markets in the US will be closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Day holiday.  Mirroring the weakening demand, inventories of metals have risen dramatically in the last couple of months. LME stocks, at a five-year high of 387,325 tonnes, are enough to supply the world for more than a week, more than twice the typical level seen over the last three years.  But a 30 per cent fall in Shanghai copper stocks on Friday was seen as another factor which gave a brief boost to prices, Widmer at BNP Paribas said.  The high level of copper processing fees for 2009 further highlighted the weak demand situation, up nearly 70 per cent compared to 2008 contracts. 'Copper will be in surplus in 2009-10, but inventories are still quite low and we do not expect them to rise to unmanageable levels,' the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) said in a report.  LME aluminium was down $8 at $1,470 a tonne versus Thursday's $1,478. Zinc fell $5 to $1,260, while lead gained $15 to $1,169. Nickel rose to $10,855 a tonne from $10,695 and tin dropped to $10,900 against $11,005.
