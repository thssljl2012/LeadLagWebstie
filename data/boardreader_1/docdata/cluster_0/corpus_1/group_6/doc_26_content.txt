NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell in early trade on Thursday as news of a push by Bank of America for more government aid added to worries about mounting credit losses in the financial sector.   Shares of Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, were a top drag on the Dow, with a drop of more than 18 percent to $8.35.   Investors feared a need for more government aid pointed to mounting credit losses in the financial sector as the year-long recession deepens. The S&amp;P financial index fell 3.5 percent.   Shares of Citigroup tumbled nearly 12 percent to $4, a day before the bank was due to report its quarterly results.   Citi shares have been on the defensive since the bank announced the sale of a controlling stake in its Smith Barney retail brokerage business, a crown jewel, to Morgan Stanley to replenish capital.   On Nasdaq, shares of Apple Inc were a top drag, falling 4.6 percent to $81.50 after the iPod and iPhone maker said Chief Executive Steve Jobs had decided to take a leave of absence due to health issues.   The Dow Jones industrial average slid 104.10 points, or 1.27 percent, to 8,096.04. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index shed 12.87 points, or 1.53 percent, to 829.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 17.77 points, or 1.19 percent, to 1,471.87.   (Editing by James Dalgleish) Keywords: MARKETS STOCKS  Thomson Reuters 2009. All rights reserved.
