SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil was steady under $42 a barrel on Friday, after falling nearly 2 percent overnight, weighed down by another round of grim U.S. economic data reflecting faltering demand in the world's top energy consumer.  Investors will focus on the release of advance fourth-quarter gross domestic product data due later in the day for more clues on the outlook of the U.S. economy.  By 0341 GMT, U.S. crude was up 27 cents a barrel at $41.71, off an intraday low of $41.31, while London Brent crude gained 25 cents to $45.65.  Oil has fallen about 10 percent over the week and is down 6.7 percent over the past month, which would be its best performance since end-August.  Oil sank 1.7 percent on Thursday after reports underscored a deepening recession in the United States. The jobless rate rose to a record peak in January, while in December sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to the lowest level ever and new orders for durable long-lasting manufactured goods tumbled for a fifth month.  Shrinking demand for fuel has also contributed to the biggest four-month build-up in U.S. crude stockpiles since 1990. 'The risk is still clearly on the downside. The economic data is going to confirm that things are still slowing down,' said Mark Pervan, senior commodity strategist at ANZ Bank in Melbourne. 'Oil's big Achilles heel is the U.S. market, and that's going to continue to weigh on prices.'
