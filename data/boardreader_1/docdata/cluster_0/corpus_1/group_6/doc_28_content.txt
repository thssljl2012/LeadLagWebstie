THE share market was in positive territory at noon, led by banking stocks, but energy stocks were lower after a drop in the crude oil price overnight.  At 12.02pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 0.85 per cent at 3473.4, while the broader All Ordinaries index gained 22.2 points, or 0.65 per cent, to 3414.5. 'The market was trading fairly flat on open in anticipation of CPI (Consumer Price Index) data and we've seen it rise following that better than expected result, with inflation now at eleven-year lows,'' CommSec market analyst Juliette Saly said. 'We're seeing good gains in financial stocks today with the Commonwealth Bank leading the way, although on very thin trading.''  At 12.06pm (AEDT), Commonwealth Bank was up $1.60, or 6.47 per cent, at $26.34.  NAB had gained 57 cents, or 3.29 per cent, to $17.88, ANZ had found 60 cents, or 4.84 per cent, to $13.00 and Westpac had appreciated 46 cents, or 3.1 per cent, to $15.28. 'In the materials sector, we've had a profit downgrade from Boral and its share price is heavily under pressure but we're seeing the big miners hold up quite well,'' Ms Saly said.  Australia's largest brick maker, Boral, had slumped 60 cents, or 14.71 per cent, to $3.48 after slashing its full-year profit guidance by 40 per cent due to the deepening deterioration of the US housing market.

The spot price of gold in Sydney was $US901.15 per fine ounce at 12.14pm AEDT, down $US6.45 on Tuesday's local close of $US907.60. 'We're seeing the energy sector a bit weaker today after a tumble in the crude oil price overnight, falling nine per cent due to weaker than expected US economic data,'' Ms Saly said.  At 12.15pm AEDT, Woodside had lost 50 cents, or 1.44 per cent, to $34.15 and Oil Search had slipped 8 cents, or 1.83 per cent, to $4.28.
