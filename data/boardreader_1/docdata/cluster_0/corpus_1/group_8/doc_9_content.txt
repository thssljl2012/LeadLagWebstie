(Adds comment and detail)  MELBOURNE, March 12 (Reuters) - Australian stocks rose 0.1 percent on Thursday, with National Australia Bank  surging following a well-received strategy update, but energy stocks limiting gains as they followed oil prices lower.

The nation's top lender announced a 25 percent dividend cut, but analysts said the market was happy the update did not contain any more bad news [nSYD379188]. 'They basically haven't said anything. So everyone's taking that as a positive, expecting that the worst news is out of the way,' said Aequs Securities dealer Rick Klusman.
