Asian stocks surged, sending the benchmark index up the most in six weeks, after Citigroup and HSBC Holdings (SEHK: 0005, announcements, news)  said earnings are improving, and China's factory and property spending jumped.  'The global rally spurred by Citi may indicate a retreat of excess pessimism,' said Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. 'With governments globally bringing out stimulus measures, the world's economy is likely to start recovering in the second half.'  Japan's Nikkei-225 Index rose 4.55 per cent to close at 7,376.12, recovering from a 26-year low. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index was up 1.88 per cent at 3,244.4, while Taiwan's Weighted Index climbed 1.9 per cent to 4,759.96. Most other markets open for trading in the region advanced.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which had rebounded 1.88 per cent on Tuesday, slid 0.91 per cent to close yesterday at 2,139.025, near the day's low of 2,133.141 after a record drop in exports overshadowed a bigger than expected rise in factory and property investments.  HSBC, which operates the largest branch network among foreign banks in China, said pre-tax profit there rose 85 per cent last year, benefiting from the nation's stimulus efforts.  HSBC jumped 2.26 per cent, extending Tuesday's 13.94 per cent surge and recovering further from a 24 per cent plunge on Monday.  The Hang Seng Index ended 236.61 points or 2.02 per cent higher at 11,930.66, completely recovering from Monday's steep drop.  Hang Seng Bank (SEHK: 0011, announcements, news)  was up 5.49 per cent at HK$72.10 while BOC Hong Kong (SEHK: 2388) rose 2.33 per cent to HK$6.60.  'The Citi news seems to have eliminated some of the worries in the financial sector and there is hope that the United States market will continue to trade higher for the rest of the week,' said Sun Hung Kai Financial strategist Castor Pang.  The H-share index was up 127.07 points or 1.85 per cent at 7,007.74, with renewed talk about a stalled investment scheme for individual mainland investors to trade Hong Kong shares lending some support.  Mizuho Financial Group, the Japanese lender with the biggest subprime-related write-downs, rose 5.4 per cent in Tokyo. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's biggest bank, climbed 4.1 per cent.  'Valuations of Asian banks look attractive but going forward we have to determine which ones will be able to better manage their asset quality,' said Terrace Chum, an equities manager at Manulife Asset Management. 'The asset quality of Asian banks is just starting to deteriorate. Let's wait for another six months and see what happens.'  ANZ gained 3.2 per cent in Sydney. Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained 3 per cent. Tokio Marine Holdings climbed 7.4 per cent.  China's spending on factories and property surged 26.5 per cent to 1.03 trillion yuan (HK$1.17 trillion) in the first two months of the year, the statistics bureau said, exceeding analyst estimates. Anhui Conch Cement (SEHK: 0914) rose 1.47 per cent in Hong Kong.  A rally in mainland stocks fizzled after data released by the customs bureau during the lunch-time break showed exports tumbled by a record 25.7 per cent from a year earlier, while imports fell 24.1 per cent.  'It's going to be very difficult for China to shake off the global recession,' said Fraser Howie, a Singapore-based managing director at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.
