SYDNEY, March 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares gained 0.3 percent on Monday, lifted by strength in the top miners, though gains were capped by fresh weakness in financials, including the nation's top lender National Australia Bank. The benchmark index briefly fell over 2 percent following a number of erroneous trades in insurer QBE, before the trades were cancelled. At 0427 GMT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index was up 9.2 points at 3,154.7. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index was down 0.1 percent to 2,469.2.

Analysts said the wheat exporter was recovering after hitting an historic low of 70 cents last week, while there was also talk of industry consolidation in the grains sector. 0429 GMT * Shares in energy company Linc Energy rose 32.2 percent to A$1.62 as investors awaited the outcome of negotiations with Chinese buyers for Linc's Emerald (Teresa) coal tenements. 'People are digesting and taking a view as to the likely conclusion of that tenement sale. If you put a billion dollars in cash to something like that, it becomes a very different company. Without the billion dollars, it's essentially stuck with an undeveloped tenement bid,' said Peter Wright, dealer at Burrell &amp; Co. 0430 GMT * Biotechnology company Avexa Ltd rose 2.7 percent to A$0.08 after the company said it had agreed with Progen to not proceed with a proposed merger. 0413 * Shares in QBE fell 3.9 percent to A$15.66, after plunging due to a number of erroneous trades, including some at as low A$0.004. 0355 GMT * The majority of financial stocks fell, led by a 4.4 percent fall in NAB to A$16.06.
