The Australian stock market has closed slightly lower in mostly flat trading as Australia's unemployment rate hit a four-year high.  Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on Thursday show that the jobless rate jumped to 5.2 per cent in February, from 4.8 per cent in January, as economic growth deteriorated.  At the 1615 AEDT close, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was 8.9 points, or 0.27 per cent lower, at 3,235.5 while the broader All Ordinaries index dipped 8.7 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 3,190.4.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was two points higher at 3,231 on a volume of 20,457 contracts, according to preliminary calculations.  City Index Australia markets strategist Alex Douglas said trading on the local bourse was relatively flat. 'Some of the initial excitement from the financial (sector's) gains in the US has worn off, and we're really just chopping sideways now,' he said. 'Even the employment data today hasn't really done a great deal for the market today in either direction.' Mr Douglas said the property sector performed well, as investors looked for bargains after recent heavy selling.  Among the major banks, the National Australia Bank lifted 43 cents to $16.73 as it said it would slash its first half dividend by about 25 per cent, boost its Australian business and consider potential acquisitions thrown up by the global financial crisis.  Mr Douglas said that despite the dividend cut, investors appeared to be satisfied with NAB's overall strategy.  The ANZ fell 29 cents at $12.86, Westpac lost 27 cents to $16.60, and Commonwealth Bank gained six cents to $28.67.  In the resources sector, global miner BHP Billiton retreated 15 cents to $30.35, and Rio Tinto strengthened 37 cents to $50.17.  Nickel producer Western Areas climbed 27 cents to $3.56 after it signed an offtake and $45 million financing agreement with BHP Billiton.  Oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum surrendered $1.01 to $35.98, and Santos picked up eight cents to $16.00.  On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.91 points to 6,930.4, with profit-taking eating into early gains.  In the gold sector, Lihir rose 13 cents to $2.99, Newcrest was up 83 cents at $31.74, and Newmont added 20 cents to $5.70.  The price of gold in Sydney at 1622 AEDT was $US912.90 per fine ounce, up $US15.20 on Wednesday's close of $US897.70.  Retailer Woolworths descended 40 cents to $25.10, and Wesfarmers, which owns Coles, climbed 36 cents to $17.70.  New Zealand-based The Warehouse Group firmed six cents to $2.68 despite reporting a 24 per cent drop in interim net profit and saying it expects the retail environment to remain soft.  Telco Telstra improved seven cents to $3.15, and Optus-owner Singapore Telecommunications scraped off one cent to $2.46.  In the media sector, News Corp nudged up one cent to $9.57, and its non-voting stock stepped forward 11 cents to $8.56.  Consolidated Media backtracked seven cents to $1.88, and Fairfax slipped 1.5 cents to 83 cents.  Among other stocks, agricultural projects manager Timbercorp sagged 1.4 cents to 9.6 cents as it would lift its provision for doubtful debts by about $24 million as a result of rising defaults caused by the global economic crisis.  Health information technology firm IBA Health Group was in a trading halt as it sought to raise up to $124 million via the issue of new shares, using the proceeds to reduce debt. IBA last traded at 77.5 cents.  The top-traded stock by volume was real estate firm Goodman Group, with 54.31 million shares worth $11.1 million changing hands.
