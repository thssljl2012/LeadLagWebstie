By Malcolm Morrison, The Canadian Press TORONTO - Stock markets were negative Friday amid enormous job losses in the United States last month. Indexes had started off sharply higher as investors were somewhat relieved that the February U.S. non-farms payrolls report wasn't worse. But by mid-afternoon Toronto's S&amp;P/TSX composite index was down 94 points to 7,535.2 after the U.S. Labour Department said the economy shed 651,000 jobs last month - just slightly above expectations - while the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 8.1 per cent from 7.6 per cent in January. 'I don't know if it could have been a heck of a lot worse,' said Blair Falconer, portfolio manager at HSBC Securities. 'That was a poor number and they revised by over 100,000 jobs for December and January numbers.' The Dow Jones industrials also gave up a strong early lead to fall 83.9 points to 6,510.5 as revised data show U.S. job losses in December totalled 681,000, more than 100,000 or 18 per cent higher than originally reported, while 655,000 jobs were lost in January, 57,000 more than originally reported. The TSX Venture Exchange was up a tenth of a point to 829.79, while the Canadian dollar is up a tenth of a US cent to 77.72 cents U.S. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 22.83 points to 1,276.76, while the S&amp;P 500 index moved down 11.7 points to 670.85. Apple Inc. was a drag on the Nasdaq after analysts at JP Morgan recently lowered their price target for the company. Apple shares fell $4.94 to US$83.90. The mixed showing came at the end of a week that saw indexes break through recent lows hit last November on growing pessimism about economic conditions, leaving the Dow industrials at 1997 levels and the TSX at 2003 lows. Many analysts believe there is little keeping stocks from falling even further as worries about the automotive and financial sectors continue to weigh on investors. The Toronto financial sector was down one per cent and CIBC (TSX: CM.TO) shed 40 cents to $37.46 .
