On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 80 points higher at 3247 on a volume of 27,474 contracts.  ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said the local market was stronger after Wall St made its first big upwards move in weeks.  'Our gains were a bit more muted than in the US,'' Mr Walker said.  'It's good that our market has tempered its gains a little bit - when the market goes up and down by over 5 per cent like it does in the US, it's a bit unnerving.''  Mr Walker said local mining and financial stocks led the market forward.  'BHP Billiton has been the largest single factor behind the market's movement,'' he said.  'There has been a strong performance from all the major banks except for National Australia Bank, which was a bit flat.  'The gold sector has been a little weak, and Telstra and CSL are some of the other stocks that were dragging on the market.''  BHP Billiton rose $1.22, or 4.17 per cent, to $30.50, while Rio Tinto added $1.50, or 3.11 per cent, to $49.80.  National Australia Bank was up 2c at $16.30, Commonwealth Bank added 83c to $28.61, ANZ increased 41c to $13.15 and Westpac added 42c to $16.87.  The spot price of gold in Sydney closed at $US897.70 per fine ounce, down $US19.65 on Tuesday's local close of $USS917.35.  Lihir Gold fell 19c, or 6.23 per cent, to $2.86, Newmont Mining lost 37c, or 6.3 per cent, to $5.50, while Newcrest Mining was up 16c at $30.91.
