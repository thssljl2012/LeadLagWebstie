(Adds financials, Fortescue)  SYDNEY, March 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares turned negative on Monday, erasing earlier gains after financials extended losses, led by the nation's top lender National Australia Bank . 'There's just so much ambiguity there still...there does not seem to be any concrete, unambiguous resolution, or way forward for financials offshore, and as long as that's the case it's going to be very hard for our financials to make headwind themselves,' said Peter Wright, dealer at Burrell &amp; Co.
