THE share market has closed nearly 2 per cent higher buoyed by the local mining and financial sectors and following a rally on Wall Street overnight. At the 4.15pm (AEDT) close, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 59.9 points, or 1.88 per cent, at 3,244.4, while the broader All Ordinaries index added 55.9 points, or 1.78 per cent, to 3199.1.   ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said the market was stronger after Wall Street made its first big upwards move in weeks. 'Our gains were a bit more muted than in the US,'' Mr Walker said. 'It's good that our market has tempered its gains a little bit - when the market goes up and down by over 5 per cent like it does in the US, it's a bit unnerving.''  Mr Walker said the local mining and financial stocks led the market forward. 'BHP Billiton has been the largest single factor behind the market's movement,'' he said. 'There has been a strong performance from all the major banks except for National Australia Bank, which was a bit flat. 'The gold sector has been a little weak, and Telstra and CSL are some of the other stocks that were dragging on the market.'' Resources headed the day's gains.  BHP Billiton rose 4.17 per cent to $30.50, while Rio Tinto added 3.11 per cent to $49.80.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 80 points higher at 3247 on a volume of 27,474 contracts.   More to come.
