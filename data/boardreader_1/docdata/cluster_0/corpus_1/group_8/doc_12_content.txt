 European stocks ended a four-week losing streak after Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Bank of America Corp said they were profitable, fueling speculation the worst of the banking crisis may be over.  Dexia SA, the worlds largest lender to local governments, surged 62 percent, while Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG climbed at least 19 percent. Fortis, whose state-organized breakup was rejected by shareholders last month, soared 28 percent after BNP Paribas SA made a revised offer for its former banking units in Belgium and Luxembourg. BHP Billiton Ltd led mining stocks higher after gains in Chinese factory spending.  The Dow Jones STOXX 600 Index rose 5.7 percent to 168.57, the steepest weekly advance since the period ended Jan. 2, as banks recovered from the worst year for financial institutions since the Great Depression.  What set off the rebound was Citigroup saying the start to the year was better, said Matthieu Giuliani, a fund manager at Palatine Asset Management in Paris, which oversees about US$5.6 billion.
