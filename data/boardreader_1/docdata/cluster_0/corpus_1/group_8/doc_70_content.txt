 Asian shares were mixed Monday with energy-related stocks helped by a stronger crude oil price but the Nikkei 225 struggling to shrug off another dose of poor economic data. The Nikkei erased an early rise to be 0.2% lower with South Korea's Kospi Composite 1.0% higher and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 rising 0.7%. New Zealand's NZX-50 was up 0.2%. Some investors were taking a bit of heart from a late-Friday recovery in most U.S. share indexes, as buying came into recently-sold stocks like General Electric and Citigroup. 'Wall Street looked due a rebound. But everything is still very gloomy - it's the first time in living memory that at this point in the year, people are so bearish for the whole year ahead,' said AmFraser head of retail research Najeeb Jarhom Investors were still digesting Friday's news that U.S. nonfarm payrolls fell 651,000 in February and that job losses in the two previous months were worse than thought. The jobless rate hit 8.1%. 'There was no cheer in those numbers,' said Patersons head of Sydney retail trading, Chris Blair. 'But if we do consolidate (further), then I think we are getting used to that bad news.' Trade may stay choppy in a week light on data and events in the U.S. and Europe in particular. Japanese shares had turned lower as data showed Japan registered its first current account gap in 13 years in January, a further sign its business activity with the rest of the world was weakening; the deficit in the current account was Y172.8 billion before seasonal adjustment, worse than a Y19.3 billion deficit predicted by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Nikkei. Oil-related stocks were higher in Tokyo with Inpex up 3.4%, Japan Petroleum Exploration adding 4.5%, Nippon Oil up 2.3% and Showa Shell up 3%. Insurance stocks were falling, though, with Tokio Marine down 2.8% and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance off 4.1%. It was a similar picture in Australia: BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto were both up more than 5.0% and Newcrest adding 2.6%, while Woodside was up 1.5% and Santos 3.5% higher. But in the financial space, QBE was down 3.6%, with National Australia Bank falling 2.0%. There were some gains for financial stocks in Korea after recent declines, with KB Financial up 1.3%. Construction and technology shares also rose with Hyundai Engineering and Construction adding 2.6%. New Zealand shares were being led higher by Contact Energy, which gained 6.3%, albeit in very thin volume. The euro was on the rise against the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen, after slipping back late on Friday, with the single currency at $1.2719, from $1.2641, and at Y124.83, from Y124.21. The U.S. dollar was at Y98.15 from Y98.27 Friday, though off a low of Y97.91 as the Japanese data hurt sentiment for the yen. Danica Hampton, a currency strategist at Bank of NZ, said the euro may remain in its recent ranges given a light data calendar in the U.S., U.K. and eurozone this week. 'With interest rates in the all major economies starting to converge, relative growth prospects (and the measures taken by policymakers to promote economic growth) have become increasingly important for driving currencies.' March Japanese government bond futures were lower after U.S. Treasurys fell Friday, with the contract down 0.09 at 138.55 points. Safe-haven buying aided spot gold with the metal up $1.65 from New York levels Friday, at $940.05 a troy ounce. April Nymex crude oil was $1.10 higher on Globex at $46.42/bbl, adding to Friday's 4.4% rise in New York, on talk the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would decide at its March 15 meeting to cut production. Still, 'OPEC may not cut output further if crude prices climb above $50/bbl and stay there before the meeting. That would trigger a large sell-off,' said Koichi Murakami, at Daiichi Shohin in Tokyo.
