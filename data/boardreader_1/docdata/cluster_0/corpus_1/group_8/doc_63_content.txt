AUSTRALIAN stocks have been buoyed by Wall Street's overnight rebound, maintaining an almost two per cent surge throughout Wednesday morning.  At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 62 points, or 1.95 per cent, at 3,246.5 while the broader All Ordinaries index added 58.2 points, or 1.85 per cent, to 3,201.4.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 81 points higher at 3,248 on a volume of 16,633 contracts.   Shaw Stockbroking head dealer Jamie Spiteri said the broader market was stronger on the back of Wall Street's rally driven by news from Citigroup that it was profitable during January and February. 'Our rise here is a little more subdued given that we haven't had some of the damaging falls we've seen in the US,' Mr Spiteri said. The financial sector is enjoying a moderate rally, with a correction taking place in the shares of wealth managers and insurers AXA Asia Pacific Holdings and AMP Ltd. 'Their moves over the last month ... it's been part of the market which has been damaged in the last two weeks, so we're seeing a bit of a correction upwards in those prices.' AMP jumped 22 cents or 5.91 per cent to $3.94, and AXA was up 17 cents or 5.96 per cent to $3.02.   Australia's major lenders mostly were higher, with ANZ Banking Group adding 41 cents, or 3.22 per cent to $13.15.   Commonwealth Bank firmed 78 cents or 2.81 per cent to $28.56, Westpac put on 36 cents, or 2.19 per cent to $16.81, while National Australia Bank lost 12 cents or 0.74 per cent to $16.16 ahead of its market update on Thursday.
