The Australian stockmarket closed lower yesterday on the back of weaker resources and banking sectors.  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 58.3 points, or 1.61 per cent, at 3557.4 points, while the broader  Ordinaries index was 54.9 points, or 1.55 per cent lower, at 3492.3 points.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was down 46 points at 3553 points on a volume of 13,906 contracts.  ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said trading was relatively quiet given the lead-up to Christmas.  ''We didn't get much of a lead from the United States markets on Friday and our market is down around 60 points, so it's probably a little bit worse than what you may have anticipated,'' he said.  ''But it's probably just people exiting positions before the Christmas break.''  In the resources sector, global miner BHP Billiton fell 28c to $29.64 while Rio Tinto was down $1.61 at $37.40. Coal seam gas explorer Pure Energy Resources skyrocketed $1.49, or 50 per cent, to $4.47 as it agreed to be taken over by CSG producer Arrow Energy.  Arrow Energy sagged 24c, or 10.96 per cent, to $1.95.  Manganese miner OM Holdings shed 7c to $1.00 as it closed out some foreign currency hedges, realising a mark-to-market loss of $13.1 million.  Oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum was 30c richer at $32.75 and Santos descended 67c to $13.62. Among the major banks, National Australia Bank dumped 39c at $19.61, ANZ gained 22c at $14.86 and Westpac fell 53c to $16.78. Commonwealth Bank retreated 74c at $27.06.  A Commonwealth Bank spokesperson declined to comment on whether the Australian Securities and Investments Commission was investigating whether the bank had breached its continuous disclosure obligations over its $2billion capital raising last week.  The concern arose when the bank said it expected a rise in expected bad debts but did not notify the market as a whole.  In the retail sector, Wesfarmers, which owns Coles, was off 77c at $16.62 and Woolworths lost 40c at $26.09. Telstra worsened 5c at $3.67. AAP
