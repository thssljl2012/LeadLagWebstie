THE  slipped in the red to close lower today, led down by weaker major mining stocks.  At 1615 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 26 points, or 0.73 per cent, to 3,531.4, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 24.1 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 3,468.2.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 21 points lower at 3,532 on a volume of 15,725 contracts. 'There was a fall off the cliff around 1300 AEDT - a lot of people went out to lunch - and then we zig-zagged and finished up off the lows,' Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said. 'But it was BHP Billiton and Rio that came in for a belting of the major stocks,' he said. Rio Tinto said it had suspended its iron ore production at one of their mines in Western Australia on Monday.   Rio's share price closed $2.03, or 5.43 per cent, lower at $35.37, while BHP lost $1.15 or 3.88 per cent to $28.49 despite higher metals prices in London overnight.   Metals were broadly higher thanks to a weaker US dollar and rising Chinese imports, IG Markets' research analyst Ben Potter said. 'However, gains are expected to be limited with underlying demand concerns likely to cap significant rises,' he said. China's central bank announced on Monday a cut of 0.27 percentage points in its benchmark one-year rate, which disappointed Asian markets today, Mr Potter said. 'Many participants had been looking for a larger cut, some as much as double the 27 basis points received.' Australia's largest energy retailer, AGL Energy, and Sydney Gas remained in trading halts pending an announcement about a material transaction, which the latter says is in relation to a takeover bid.   AGL last traded at $15.45 and Sydney Gas last traded at 27.5 cents before their trading was halted.   Oil stocks were mixed at 1626 AEDT, with Oil Search firming 10 cents or 2.5 per cent to $4.10, Santos gaining 22 cents to $13.84, but Woodside Petroleum lost 59 cents to $32.16.   Gold stocks were mostly stronger. Lihir Gold was up three cents to $2.85, while Newcrest Mining advanced $1.02 to $32.42.   By 1630 AEDT, the spot price of gold in Sydney was $US842.75 per fine ounce, down $US1.80 on Monday's close of $US844.55.   Most banks lost ground with the exception of ANZ Banking Group, which gained one cent to $14.87. 'The banks have held up well today,' Mr Heffernan said.   Westpac was the worst performer of the major banks, backtracking 52 cents, or 3.1 per cent, to $16.26, while National Australia Bank gave up one cent to $19.60.   Commonwealth Bank of Australia softened two cents to $27.04.   Shares in Bendigo and Adelaide Bank closed down 63 cents, or 5.37 per cent, to $11.11 after it said it had raised $175 million via a share purchase plan and an institutional placement.
