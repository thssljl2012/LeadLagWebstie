By Carla Mozee Brazilian equities lost ground Tuesday as the central bank began deliberations on its next interest-rate move, while Mexican stocks stretched advances from the previous session. Brazil's Bovespa reversed gains, and was last down 0.7% at 38,022.21. The benchmark surged 8.3% on Monday. Banking stocks were mostly lower. Unibanco (UBB) shares fell 1.3%, Banco Itau (ITU) shed 0.8%, Banco do Brasil fell 2.2%, and Banco Bradesco (BBD) slipped 0.6%. As interest-rate policy-makers gathered for their two-day meeting in Brasilia, Brazil's statistic agency said Tuesday that gross domestic product in the third quarter grew 6.8%, faster than the forecast for growth of 5.74%, according a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires. It was the fastest rate of expansion since the second quarter of 2004. 'Certainly, the domestic absorption continued to offset the effects of the external weakness, wrote Alfredo Coutino, senior Latin American economist at Moody's Economy.com, in a research note. He cited government measures including public investment in infrastructure and social programs as reasons for the better-than-expected GDP figure. 'Since tight monetary conditions could start to restrain the economy, and given the deterioration of the global outlook, we do expect the central bank to start relaxing monetary policy sooner rather than later,' said Coutino. He forecast GDP growth of about 5.5% for 2008. Economic growth came in at 5.2% in 2007. Meanwhile, consumer prices in the Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, rose 0.28% for the four weeks ended Dec. 7, decelerating from a 0.39% rise in November. Petrobras (PBR) shares advanced 1.6%.

The annual inflation rate in November climbed to 6.23% on an annualized basis, up from 5.78% in October, as prices for housing, electricity and certain food items increased. The consumer-price index for the month rose to 1.14%, above the Dow Jones Newswires estimate of 1.10%. The core rate rose to 0.5%. The country's key interest rate stands at 8.25% where it was left by the central bank late last month. Mexico's IPC equity index was up 1.5% to 21,478.47, extending the 5.4% rise on Monday when investors eyed opportunities for the country's exporters from U.S. President-elect Barack Obama's plan for major investment in infrastructure.
