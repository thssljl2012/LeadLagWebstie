The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a higher opening on Tuesday. The TARP investment in GMAC should infuse some optimism into the auto sector on another day of thin trading. Notwithstanding the continuation of the conflict in the Middle East, the prices of commodities have begun pulling back, which reflects the extremely pessimistic economic outlook. The markets may also react to a couple of market moving economic reports, including the NAPM-Chicago manufacturing index and the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, to be released shortly after the markets open.  U.S. stocks, which opened almost unchanged on Monday, receded sharply in early trading, as the conflict in Gaza put traders on the defensive. After bottoming in the after, the major averages recouped some of their losses by the close of the session.  The Dow Industrials ended down 31.62 points or 0.37% at 8,484 and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index fell 3.38 points or 0.39% to 869, while the Nasdaq Composite ended down 19.92 points or 1.30% at 1,510.  Twenty-five of the thirty Dow components ended the session lower, with most stocks showing modest declines. Bank of America (BAC) (down 3.14%), Disney (DIS) (down 3.20%), Citigroup (C) (down 2.38%), DuPont (DD) (down 1.96%) and General Electric (GE) (down 1.94%) were among the notable decliners. On the other hand, Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Pfizer (PFE) advanced.  Among the sub-indexes, the Amex Securities Broker/Dealer Index slipped 1.11% and the KBW Bank Index fell 1.22%. The Amex Biotechnology Index ended down 1.61% compared to a 1.72% drop by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. While the Amex Disk Drive Index fell 2.08%, the Amex Networking Index moved down 1.53% and the Amex Internet Index slipped 2.51%.  However, the Amex Oil Index and the Philadelphia Oil Service Index rose 1.91% and 3.01%, respectively. The Amex Gold Bugs Index ended up 2.99%.  With the markets having discounted a long and deep recession that is expected to last until 2009, there is unlikely to be an instant recovery in the beginning of 2009. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Marc Pado is of the view that even negative news may not produce the downside that some fear, as expectations are for the economy to get worse
