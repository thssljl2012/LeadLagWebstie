The Australian sharemarket was higher at noon after gains in the financial sector and following Wall Streets rally on Friday.

On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index contract was up 98 points at 3,621 on a volume of 15,760 contracts.  ABN AMRO Morgans private client adviser Bill Bishop said it was green across the screen.  The American market went up on Friday because the employment figures were so bad the market was hoping the government would pump more cheap money into the economy, Mr Bishop said.  There has been a lot of optimism after the rally on the American market.  Our banks are up between 2.5 and five per cent and it has been a very good start to the day.
