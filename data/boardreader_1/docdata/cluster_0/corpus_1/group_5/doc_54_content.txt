THE share market closed around 1 per cent higher, with a stronger resources sector helping to offset falls in major bank stocks caused by capital raisings.  At 4.15pm (AEDT) the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was 36.4 points or 1.01 per cent higher at 3640.7, while the broader All Ordinaries was up 39.6 points or 1.12 per cent, at 3573.3.  Alternative moves by the resources and banking sectors came about as the banking sector absorbed recent placements by Westpac and Commonwealth Bank Shaw Stockbroking head dealer Jamie Spiteri said. 'That's had a dampening effect on the banking sector, and contrary to that the resources sector was very strong''. 'Some believe it identifies the extended short positions which have been opened up in that resources sector - some of those positions are forced closed as prices are firming dramatically here today,'' he said.  Resources were the big winners for the day with gains right across the sector.   Rio Tinto and Oil Search were the standout performers surging over 11 per cent despite weaker commodity prices in London overnight.  Rio Tinto jumped 12.14 per cent to $37.40 and Oil Search rose 11.21 per cent, to $4.76.  BHP Billiton also finished higher jumping 6.71 per cent to $30.36, while oil company Santos added $1.00 to $13.90 and Woodside Petroleum firmed $1.27 to $33.70. 'Significant weakness across the resources sector in recent weeks is being reversed as stocks are reacting to oversold situations,'' Mr Spiteri said.   The big banks all seemed to be taking a hit with drops from almost all the big players.   CBA finished 5 per cent weaker at $28.50 - its lowest since December 2003. 'CBA has been sold down three times by fund managers wanting cash in order to buy the others,'' Marcus Padley of the Marcus Today newsletter said. 'NAB has raised $3 billion, QBE $2 billion and Westpac $2.5 billion - you want to be at the front of that queue not the back,'' he said.   Westpac's shares fell 8.45 per cent to $16.37, NAB lost 30 cents to $19.60 and ANZ was the only gainer for the day adding five cents to $14.15.  Retailers were a mixed bag.  David Jones added 12 cents to $3.01, Harvey Norman dropped 2.54 per cent to $2.30.   In news today, the board of MYOB said it intended to accept a higher bid from a private equity consortium that had its original offer rejected by the software company.  MYOB's shares finished 8.76 per cent higher at $1.05.   By the 4.15pm close gold miners were mixed with Lihir Gold shedding 4 cents to $2.26 and Newcrest Mining up 36 cents to $28.59.   The spot price of gold in Sydney was trading at $US778.40 per fine ounce up US$6.15 on Tuesday's close of $US772.25.   Media stocks were softer, with Consolidated Media losing 5 cents to $2.06 and News Corporation (the parent company of the publisher of news.com.au) down 3 cents to $13.13.  Fairfax Media named Brian McCarthy as its new chief executive and managing director with the Fairfax board declaring its 'unanimous support'' for chairman Ron Walker.  The stock was steady at $1.505.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index contract was up 33 points at 3,648 on a volume of 27,928 contracts.
