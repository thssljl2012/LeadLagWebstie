HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Asian markets shot higher Wednesday, as expectations of interest-rate cuts and economic-stimulus measures forced bearish investors to reverse bets that the downtrend in stocks will continue. Resource stocks such as Rio Tinto and financials like HSBC Holdings finished sharply higher, helping indexes gain across the region. Japan's Nikkei 225 Average took its winning streak to a third session, climbing 3.2% to 8,660.24, its highest finish in nearly a month. The broader Topix index added 2% to 834.55. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 5.6% to 15,577.74, reclaiming the psychologically crucial 15,000-point level after dropping 1.9% in the previous session. 'Investors are expecting further rate cuts in the U.S. and that Hong Kong may follow. The market overcame the resistance at 15,000, so the short positions got squeezed,' said Andrew To, sales director at Taifook Securities in Hong Kong. The U.S. Federal Reserve was widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 0.5% next week. 'The focus will return to fundamentals and corporate earnings in February, but right now, investors are enjoying the ride,' To added. China's Shanghai Composite also rebounded from losses to finish 2% higher at 2,079.12.

'We are well into the period where we're expecting hedge-fund closures, and daily we're hearing about funds reducing staff. But from the investor point of view, there's still a lot of optimism out there about [government] economic-stimulus packages,' said Benjamin Collett, head of hedge-fund sales trading at Daiwa Securities SMBC. Regional detail Shares of Air China (HK:2600: news, chart, profile) soared 22.1% in Hong Kong and rose 4.2% in Shanghai a day after the Chinese civil-aviation regulator said it was encouraging airlines to cancel or postpone taking delivery of aircraft due in 2009 because air-travel demand is falling.
