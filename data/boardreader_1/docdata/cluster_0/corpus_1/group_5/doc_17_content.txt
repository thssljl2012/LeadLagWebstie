TOKYO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average is expected to rise on Tuesday, helped by blue-chip stocks such as Canon Inc after optimism about proposed U.S. infrastructure spending and a government bailout of the three U.S. automakers boosted Wall Street. Sumco Corp will be in focus after the Nikkei business daily said the silicon wafer maker has decided to spend an additional 17 billion yen ($183.2 million) to boost output capacity for solar wafers at a 14.5 billion yen plant under construction in Japan. 'Japanese stocks will likely move higher on receding fears about the financial crisis that started in America, at least for now, and on hopes for massive infrastructure spending plans,' said Hiroichi Nishi, general manger at Nikko Cordial Securities. Still, another market player cautioned a stronger yen may limit gains in the overall market. Nikkei futures traded in Chicago closed at 8,495 on Monday, 125 points above their close in Osaka. Market participants expect the benchmark Nikkei to trade between 8,300 and 8,600 on Tuesday. It climbed 5.2 percent on Monday to 8,329.05, its highest close in a week. U.S. stocks rallied to their highest level in a month on Monday on optimism President-elect Barack Obama's proposed infrastructure spending could limit the depth of the year-old recession and on hopes for the bailout of the 'Big Three' automakers. ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2303 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT LAST PCT CHG NET CHG S&amp;amp;P 500 909.7 3.84% 33.630 USD/JPY 92.92 0.09% 0.080 10-YR US TSY YLD 2.7447 -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD 770.5 -0.10% -0.800 US CRUDE 43.83 0.27% 0.100 DOW JONES 8934.18 3.46% 298.76 ------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; Wall St rallies on infrastructure plan; FedEx falls &gt; US dollar falls as stimulus plans boost risk-taking &gt; Bonds fall on stock gains, looming supply &gt; Gold rallies on economic optimism, inflation fears &gt; Oil jumps 7 pct, Saudi Arabia deepens cuts STOCKS TO WATCH -- Nintendo Co Ltd Nintendo said sales of its Wii game console more than doubled during the week of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, apparently defying the retail gloom of the global economic crisis. -- Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Japan's largest bank said its planned capital raising will bring in about $8.6 billion, replenishing funds after losses on its equity portfolio and an investment in Morgan Stanley. -- Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd Sumitomo Metal Mining, Japan's second-largest copper smelter, said it would lower production of the industrial metal in the first quarter of next year as the economic downturn dents demand for copper.
