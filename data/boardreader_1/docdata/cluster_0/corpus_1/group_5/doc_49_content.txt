THE sharemarket was higher at noon in thin trading ahead of the Christmas break, despite weaker US markets overnight.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 36.3 points, or 1.03 per cent, to 3,567.7.  The broader All Ordinaries index gained 33.1 points, or 0.98 per cent, at 3501.3.  The stock market will close around 2.30pm AEDT and will not trade again until Monday, December 29.  CMC Markets corporate dealer Andrew Knight said the market's move upwards was surprising given that US markets were lower overnight, and pre-Christmas trading was typically thin. 'The banks on the whole are seeing a bit of buoyancy coming in but there's no volume behind it,'' he said. 'The consumer staples (stocks) and the telcos seem to be standing out at the moment, but apart from that it does seem to be driven by a bit of sentiment coming into the market after two down days this week.''
