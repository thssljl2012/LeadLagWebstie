MELBOURNE, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 0.75 percent on Tuesday, hit by investors cashing out of the top banks to pay for $1.7 billion in new shares in Westpac Banking Corp , though U.S.  infrastructure spending plans boosted the miners. The Australian market had been poised to open nearly 3 percent higher after a strong rally on Wall Street, but instead fell in early trade after Westpac went on a trading halt for a A$2.5 billion share placement. 'If it wasn't for that Westpac raising, we would have had a strong day today,' said James Foulsham, head of trading at CMC Markets. Adding to concerns about capital raisings, BlueScope Steel Ltd, Australia's biggest steel maker, went on a trading halt pending an announcement on capital management. Investors speculated that would be a capital raising to help it pay down A$400 million in short-term debt due in February. 'It's just a further reminder that cash has to be kept in reserve for possible participation in further issues,' said Shaw Stockbroking senior dealer Jamie Spiteri. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index fell 27.3 points to close at 3,604.3, following a 4.1 percent rally on Monday. New Zealand's NZX50 rose 0.9 percent to finish at 2,724.7. Following Westpac's raising, Commonwealth Bank of Australia sank 8.5 percent to A$30 on fears it would also come to the market with new shares. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group fell 5.6 percent to A$14.10, while National Australia Bank, which raised equity last month, fell 5 percent to A$19.90. Top miner BHP Billiton rose 4.5 percent to A$28.45 and Rio Tinto bounced 4 percent to A$33.35 after oil and copper prices surged on hopes U.S. President-elect Barack Obama's infrastructure spending plan would boost demand for metals. For the first time in two weeks, since BHP dropped its bid for Rio, Rio Tinto outperformed BHP during the day. 'In any environment where we may see a recovery in commodity prices -- overnight saw a reasonable outcome for LME metals -- Rio is likely to be the outperformer as their debt refinancing becomes less of an issue,' said Ausbil Dexia portfolio manager Adam Dixon. Perilya surged to a high of 20 cents and ended up 7 percent at A$0.16 after Chinese metals company Shenzen Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet Co agreed to buy A$46 million new shares at A$0.23, giving it a majority stake in the Australian zinc miner.
