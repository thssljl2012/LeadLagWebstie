LONDON (Reuters) - Copper gained more than 7 percent on Monday, with other industrial metals also rebounding higher, on hopes that a United States government stimulus package would help soften the impact of a recession and support demand.  Adding to the positive sentiment, European equities surged more than 5 percent, tracking gains in the United States and Asia.  The upward trend came after U.S. President-elect Barack Obama said on Saturday that his plan to create at least 2.5 million new jobs included the largest infrastructure investment since the 1950s.  Copper for three month delivery on the London Metal Exchange rose 7.3 percent to a high of $3,274 per tonne before easing to $3,191 in LME rings versus $3,050 on Friday.  But prices of the metal used in power and construction have fallen more than 60 percent since a record high of $8,940 in July.  Highlighting the underlying uncertainty behind the day's metal price rises, LME copper stocks jumped 3,425 tonnes to 300,725 tonnes and its highest level since early 2004. 'We are rebounding from the low levels,' said Eugen Weinberg, commodity strategist at Commerzbank. 'Industrial metals are to see some rebound due to the stronger (equity) markets.' He added that the broadly weaker dollar was also helping drive metal prices.  Aluminium hit a high of $1,545 and was trading at $1,519 in LME rings from $1,491 on Friday. The metal used in transport and packaging was also boosted by hopes of a bail out for the U.S. auto sector.  Stocks in aluminium, which has come under pressure in recent weeks on news of deteriorating car sales data from auto makers, soared 8,925 tonnes to 1.8758 million tonnes -- its highest since November 1994. 'Metals got hammered last week, so it's a technical bounce,' Leon Westgate, an analyst at Standard Bank said. '(It's also) a weaker dollar and comments by Obama on the stimulus package.' 'How sustained it will be is arguable ... certainly with LME inventories continuing to build up.' Further doubts over the sustainability of the rally were raised after investment bank Fairfax cut its copper forecasts for H1 2009 to $3,500 from $3,968 a tonne. 'We were not brave enough to forecast the timing and severity of the current downturn although we have always assumed longer price levels closer to the marginal cost of production as a more normal state of affairs for the metals markets,' said Fairfax analysts in a note.  Helping to support metal prices however -- which hit multi-year lows last week -- mining companies Anglo American and Rio Tinto this week will announce they are slashing capital expenditure budgets for next year, the Financial Times reported.  Nickel was at $9,250 a tonne from $9,050 at the close on Friday and lead was unchanged at $960.  Tin advanced to a high of $12,270 a tonne and was quoted at $11,500/$11,550 in LME rings, from its last bid price of $11,350/$11,400 on Friday.  Zinc rose $21 at $1,091 in LME rings, despite its LME stocks rising 1,500 tonnes to 210,600 tonnes -- its highest point since July 2006. 'Everything is up and I don't think it's any surprise -- because of the stock markets,' said one LME trader. 'Much weaker dollar (too). Those two things together are giving support to a market that has been very much oversold in the last week.'
