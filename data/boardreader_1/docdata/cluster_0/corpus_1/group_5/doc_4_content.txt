US stocks close a truncated session up, with the key indices logging gains for the first time in three days after reports showed that consumer spending and orders for durable goods topped economists forecasts.  The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closed early, ahead of the Christmas holiday. Most world markets were shut on Thursday on account of Christmas.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 49 points, or 0.6% to end at 8,468, with 22 of its 30 components trading higher. The Nasdaq Composite rose 3 points, or 0.2%, to 1,524. The S&amp;amp;P 500 rose nearly 5 points, or 0.6%, to 868.  About 3.63bn shares changed hands in the US, the least since Dec. 26, 2003.  The Dow is down 500 points since its Dec. 16 close of 8,924. The blue-chip average is down 36% for the year to date, while the broad S&amp;amp;P 500 has lost 40%, and the Nasdaq has fallen 42%.  Trading has been light through the week with many investors on vacation. In addition, to light participation, many investors have closed their books for the year and are not planning to make any large moves until 2009.  Eight of the S&amp;amp;P's 10 sectors advanced, led by a 1.3% gain in financials, a 1% rise among industrials, and a 0.9% gain in consumer staples. Energy fell 1%.  Bucking the trend among financials, CIT Group shares slumped 10%, reversing from the prior day, after the financial company announced the results of an exchange offer.  Shares of General Motors (GM) hit hard this week, led the blue-chip gains, up 8%. Automotive rival Toyota said its domestic production dropped 27.2% in November from a year earlier to 288,138 vehicles, the fourth straight monthly decrease.  Banking stocks advanced with Citigroup adding nearly 4% and Bank of America up more than 5%.  Energy shares were among the weak points in the broad market as crude-oil futures tumbled 9% to end at US$35.35 a barrel, their lowest close since April 2004. Traders focused on higher stockpiles at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point used for the benchmark crude contract.  Shares of Wal-Mart Stores added 0.3%. The world's largest retailer said late on Tuesday it will settle 63 wage-and-hour class-action lawsuits, some of which have been pending against the company over the last several years.  The shares of other retailers such as JC Penney and Best Buy also rose in the broad market.  Before the opening bell, the Labor Department said that weekly claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected. New jobless claims rose to 586,000 in the week ended Dec. 20. That is an increase of 30,000 from the previous week's revised figure of 556,000, and is more than the 558,000 total forecast by economists. Wednesday's report revealed the highest number of jobless claims since Nov. 1982, when initial filings hit 612,000.  The Commerce Department said both personal income and spending decreased in November. Personal income dipped 0.2% after a modest 0.3% increase in October. The reading was expected to be flat. Personal spending fell 0.6% versus a decline of 1% the month before. But the figure was better than the 0.8% decline that economists were expecting.  New orders of durable manufactured goods fell for the fourth month in a row, according to the Census Bureau. Durable goods orders fell 1% to US$1.9bn in November. Excluding orders related to transportation, new orders increased 1.2%.  Still, the decline was not as sharp as had been expected. Economists had forecast durable goods orders to sink 3.1% after plummeting 6.2% in October - the biggest decline since 2006.  Applications for home loans and refinancing activity surged last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The MBA's overall Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, shot up 48% on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week ending Dec. 19.

The 3-month Libor rate held steady at 1.47%. The overnight Libor edged up to 0.15% from 0.12% on Tuesday. Libor is a key bank lending rate.

Gasoline prices fell overnight to a national average of US$1.655 from US$1.659 a gallon.  The dollar fell versus the euro and the yen.
