BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- The U.S. financial sector traded lower early Thursday as news of weekly jobless claims hitting a 26-year high and uncertainty over a bailout for the teetering auto industry stoked fresh concerns about the economy. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF:XLFNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:  , , ) , an exchange-traded fund tracking financial shares, was down 2% in early dealings Thursday. Large-cap banking stocks were particularly week, as Well Fargo &amp;amp; Co. (WFC:WFCNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) lost 7%, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. (JPM:JPMNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) dropped about 4%, Bank of America Corp. (BAC:BACNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) slipped 4%, and Citigroup Inc. (C:CNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) lost more than 3%. In earnings news, U.S. Bancorp (USB:USBNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) said fourth-quarter net charge-offs could reach $650 million.  The SPDR KBW Bank ETF (KBE:KBENews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) was off about 2% on Thursday morning and is down by nearly half for the year-to-date period. The market-cap weighting of the financial sector in the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index (SPX:SPXNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) has fallen to 12.3% from 16% in October and is now at a nine-year low, according to Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. He said the financial sector is down 55.6% so far this year, and 2008 is on track to be the worst for the period since 1985. 'Financials had [year-over-year earnings declines] in just four of the past 23 years, including 1987 when the sector reported a loss,' Yardeni wrote in a note Thursday. 'A loss during 2008 could be a real possibility, as the credit crisis claims more victims and loan losses pile higher.' Elsewhere in the sector, Goldman Sachs Group (GS:GSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) shares were higher Thursday after the Financial Times reported the company is giving longtime employees an incentive to leave before the end of the year. The company, as of 2009, is extending the length of service required by Goldman employees to be eligible for the firm's full retirement package, the newspaper reported. Rather than requiring a combination of age and years of service to exceed 55, the new rule will call for a combined total of 60, according to the report. Like other Wall Street firms, Goldman has been hurt by the credit crunch and has announced layoffs. John Spence is a reporter for MarketWatch in Boston.
