 DATA: Reserve Bank of Australia minutes show its board saw a case for an early easing in monetary policy given an unwarranted tightening in financial market conditions, slowing demand and sliding asset prices.- Australia merchandise imports jumped 12 percent to an unadjusted A$19.66 billion ($17.1 billion) as the cost of oil imports surged. _____________________________________________________________* The Australian dollar remained subdued on Tuesday after minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting reaffirmed expectations for a cut in interest rates next month.* Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Aug. 5 policy meeting showed its board saw a case for an early cut in rates as a guard against a deeper slowdown in the economy [nSYC000124].* The market has already fully priced in a 25 basis points cut in the cash rate to 7.0 percent, with a 50-50 chance of a half-point easing, and the minutes did not change that view.* The Aussie dollar initially dipped on the RBA's comments but found support around $0.8635 and quickly bounced back to $0.8662. That was still down on $0.8733 late Monday and not far from seven-month lows at $0.8590.* The Aussie has shed nearly 13 percent since it struck a 25-year high of $0.9851 in July, amid a sharp rally in the U.S. currency, declining commodity prices and expectations of domestic rate cuts in coming months.* The Aussie also fell further to 95.08 yen , from 96.19 yen, as a drop in appetite for risk led investors to pare holdings in stocks and high-yielding currencies.* Stocks, especially financial sector shares, fell on Monday after Barrons reported that the U.S. Treasury might have to bail out home finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . The Treasury Department said it had no plans to use its authority to backstop either of the two companies (see [ID:nN18494933]).* Commodities were mixed with oil and metal prices falling but grains and gold advancing. The CRB commodities index  was up 0.54 percent on Monday, paring some of last week's steep losses. Australia is a big exporter of commodities.* Australian bonds were a shade lower as the RBA's minutes were not seen greatly adding to the chance of a 50 basis-point cut in rates next month.* Three-year bond futures eased 0.005 points to 94.320, while the 10-year bond contract lost 0.005 points to 94.220.
