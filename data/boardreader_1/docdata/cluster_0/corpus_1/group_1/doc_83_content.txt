 HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Chinese shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen tumbled Tuesday as worries that the country's economy may be slowing hit steelmakers such as Angang Steel Co., while shares of China Vanke slumped after the property developer lowered its construction outlook for the second half of the year. The performance of the mainland markets added to the selling pressure in Hong Kong, where heavyweight stock HSBC Holdings as well as Bank of East Asia dropped sharply after reporting weak earnings. The benchmark Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.5% to 21,949.75 in Hong Kong, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index gave up 2.8% to 11,947.64. 'Hong Kong seems to be widely regarded as the highest short-term risk market in the hedge-fund community, because of decreasing volumes and increasing price volatility' said Benjamin Collett, head of hedge fund sales trading at Daiwa Securities SMBC. 'It is becoming increasingly difficult to make short-term gains and consequently, volumes are coming off...this is the third month this year that people are looking at managing risk rather than return. Even though we are in a highly inflationary market, holding cash is probably the best trade,' said Collett. Francis Lun, general manager at Fulbright Securities, said the big drop in mainland stocks contributed to the broad weakness. 'The raw materials sector took a big blow on [fears] the demand is declining because of economic slowdown. Weakness in [heavyweight stocks like] HSBC and China Mobile hasn't helped either,' said Lun. China's Shanghai Composite, which tracks both the yuan-denominated A shares and the foreign currency-denominated B shares, fell 1.9% to 2,690.75. The B-share index in Shanghai was hit especially hard, dropping 4.2% to 199.19. In Shenzhen, the All Share index gave up 3.1% to 790.71. Leading its decline, China Vanke (CVKEF:CVKEFNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) dropped 6.3% a day after the country's largest property developer said it reduced its planned construction work during the second half due to lower demand. The drop came although the company reported a 24% increase in half-yearly net profit, and dragged down other property issues. Shares of Beijing North Star Co. (BEIJF:BEIJFNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) lost 5.9%, while Poly Real Estate Group Co. shed 7.1% in Shanghai. The rest of Asia broadly declined, with resource shares such as BHP Billiton and Inpex Holdings dragged down by a sharp fall in crude-oil prices. The resource stocks-laden Sydney market suffered big losses ahead of a decision on interest-rates by its central bank. Japanese indexes ended close to the flat line after struggling to rise during the session. Gains in exporters on the back of early weakness in the Japanese yen were countered by losses in energy-related shares. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average ended 0.1% lower at 12,914.66, after flirting with gains a few times during the session. The broader Topix index ended little changed at 1,247.71, after moving on either side of break-even. Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index stumbled as low as 4,758.50 during the session on big losses in the resource sector. However, banking stocks staged a sharp rebound in the afternoon after the Reserve Bank of Australia left its interest rates unchanged at 7.25% and indicated a rate cut could be coming in future because of slowing demand and economic growth. The index narrowed early losses to end down 1.4% at 4,820.40. Elsewhere, South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.5%, New Zealand's NZX 50 index declined 0.7%, Singapore's Straits Times index fell 1.1% in afternoon trading and Taiwan's Taiex dropped 2.4%. India's Sensitive Index, or Sensex, defied the broad trend to advance, as investors snapped up interest-rate sensitive shares such as ICICI Bank and Tata Motors on hopes the decline in crude-oil prices will ease inflationary pressures and the central bank's monetary policy. The benchmark index gained 1.4% to 14,787.42 in the afternoon, with ICICI (IBN:IBNNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) shares jumping 4.2% and Tata Motors (TTM:TTMNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) rising 2.6%. Shares of HSBC Holdings (HBC:HBCNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (HK:5: news, chart, profile) dropped 2.2% in Hong Kong a day after the bank reported a drop in quarterly profit, as bad debt charges topped $10 billion. Shares of its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank (HK:11: news, chart, profile) (HSNGY:HSNGYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) fell 0.6% but outperformed the broad market after the Hong Kong-based lender Monday reported a 2% growth in half-yearly profits.
