 The big four banks have dropped their fixed interest rates as the pressure on funding costs ease.It is the second time in less than a month that the Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, ANZ and Westpac have lowered their fixed rates.Macquarie Bank interest rate strategist Rory Robertson says some of the rates banks pay to fund their loans have eased. 'There was a bit of an inflation scare in June when petrol and oil prices were punching to the sky,' he said. '[But] in the past month or two, oil and petrol prices have come down quite a bit and so we're seeing some of the market's inflationary fears subsiding, and alongside that we're seeing some of the longer-term interest rates subsiding,' he said.
