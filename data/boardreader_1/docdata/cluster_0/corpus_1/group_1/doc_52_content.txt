 Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan says banks should consider dropping their interest rates lower than any cut announced by the Reserve Bank this week.The Reserve Bank board meets on Tuesday and is widely tipped to cut official interest rates by 0.25 per cent.Wizard Home Loans has announced today that it is cutting its variable rate by that amount to bring it to 9.29 percent.Mr Swan says the other banks should follow Wizard's lead, if the Reserve Bank takes action. 'There's absolutely no doubt that if the Reserve Bank moves that all banks should follow, there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time,' he said. 'So over time the banks will be coming down, or should be coming down over and above any cut in the Reserve rate.' 'Over and above that there have been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times they've been coming down as well. 'That does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions and other funding costs outside the Reserve Bank cycle.' ANZ and National Australia Bank have already pledged to pass on any cut in the official interest rate.
