 THE Reserve Bank will dim its outlook for the Australian economy today when it reduces growth targets in an admission that the current slowdown could be occurring too rapidly.The currency and bond markets could come under pressure when the central bank releases a quarterly update of the economy's prospects in its statement of monetary policy.The statement is expected to support the argument for a cut in the 7.25 per cent official cash rate as early as September's meeting, The Australian reported.The odds of a rate reduction are still 100 per cent, and the futures market has three cuts of 25 basis points factored in over the next year. Economists expect the RBA will today cut economic growth projections for the next two years, and forecast inflation could come back within the 2-3 per cent management bracket sooner than thought.The RBA had earlier predicted that inflation would reach 3 per cent by June 2010, but is now expected to forecast it will reach that mark by the beginning of 2010.The reduced inflation outlook will add weight to the argument that the bank can cut rates while inflation is high at 4.3 per cent.The growing prospect of a rate cut could spur enthusiasm on the Australian equities market, which should take a positive lead from Wall Street's strong showing on Friday night. The Dow Jones piled on 302.89 points in the final trading session of the week, as concerns of an oil-induced inflation sting were reduced.The buoyant performance of equities in New York has prompted the futures market to predict that the domestic market will open up to 72 points higher.The domestic fixed-income markets are supporting the prospect of a rate cut, with the yields on three-year bonds down 26 basis points last week and 20 basis points at the long end of the curve.Citi's co-head of economics, Stephen Halmarick, believes the RBA could take a very bearish tone in its statement and ratchet growth forecasts down to below 2 per cent. The bank currently predicts GDP growth of between 2.25 per cent at the end of this calendar year and 2.5 per cent out until June 2010.'I think we could get growth numbers in 2009 and 2010 which are under 2 per cent,' Mr Halmarick said. 'I think the 2.25 per cent could be brought down to 1.75 to 2 per cent.' NAB has forecast that the central bank will slice the 2.25 per cent December projection down to 2 per cent and the June 2009 prediction of 2.75 per cent down to 2.5 per cent.The revised outlook could be seen as an admission from the RBA that the current slowdown is happening faster than initially expected.
