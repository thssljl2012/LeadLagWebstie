 (Updating with full report)LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Leading shares extended losses in afternoon deals, dragged down further by Wall Street's fall amid ongoing concerns over the state of the U.S. economy and the health of its financial sector, with UK banks also feeling the heat.The FTSE 100 index closed 129.8 points lower at 5,320.4, hit mainly by banks and insurers, while the FTSE 250 index dropped 256.4 to 8,867.6 as heavyweight housebuilders slide back once more.On Wall Street, U.S. stocks also traded in negative territory after mortgage stalwarts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell to their lowest levels in nearly 20 years on Monday, on concerns that the government might need to bail them out, and with a higher-than-expected Producer Price Index reading and a fall in housing starts also weighing.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 125.4 points behind at 11,354.0 by the UK close, while the Nasdaq Composite fell back 22.55 at 2,394.43 and the S&amp;amp;P 500 index eased 11.83 at 1,266.77.Ahead of the U.S. open, government figures revealed U.S. inflation at the wholesale level rose at the fastest annual pace in nearly three decades, as core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, rose 1.2 percent in July following a 1.8 percent rise in June.And figures from the Commerce Department showed construction of homes and apartments fell in July to the lowest level in more than 17 years, with builders breaking ground on 965,000 housing units on an annualised basis, down from 1.08 million in June.In London, building materials group Wolseley, which operates widely in the U.S., led the blue-chip fallers with a drop of 8.6 percent, or 36-3/4 pence at 389-1/2.But the main weight on the FTSE 100 came from banks and insurers on the back of woes surrounding U.S. mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as a report from the Wall Street Journal claiming Lehman Brothers might post weaker-than-expected third-quarter results.And news that former IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff has said a large U.S. bank will fail in the next few months also added to investor jitters. HBOS the main casualty among the banks, down 22 pence at 277-1/2, further hit by a WestLB downgrade to 'add' from 'buy'. Elsewhere in the sector, Royal Bank of Scotland lost 13-1/2 at 215, Barclays shed 18-1/2 at 324-1/4, Lloyds TSB was off 17-3/4 at 288-1/4, and Standard Chartered eased 87 at 1,326.Insurers also featured as equity valuations dropped once more, with Aviva losing 28-3/4 at 495-3/4, Prudential down 30-1/2 at 519-1/2, and Legal&amp;amp;General sliding 6.4 at 96.7.Turning to the upside, Smith&amp;amp;Nephew was the top riser, albeit only with a gain of 2.2 percent, or 13-1/2 pence, at 632 after traders noted revived speculation that the orthopaedics firm could be a bid target for U.S. peer Zimmer Holdings.Defensives were in demand in the face of the falling wider market, boosting Scottish&amp;amp;Southern Energy up 14 at 1,453, United Utilities 4-1/2 firmer at 709-1/2 and National Grid 2 higher at 710.Miner Xstrata was another rare riser, 52 ahead at 2,871 after announcing it sees market conditions improving towards year-end.On the second line, Wellstream jumped 70 at 1,110 after the oil services group said it has won a four-year framework agreement from Petroleo Brasileiro worth over 600 million pounds.And Lloyd's insurer Hiscox continued to benefit from Monday's well-received interim results, up 2-1/2 at 227-1/4.Housebuilders featured heavily among the mid-cap fallers, after further signs Monday of the parlous state of the UK housing market, and with U.S. housing data offering little respite. Taylor Wimpey dropped 4-1/2 at 42-1/4, Persimmon was down 27 at 305 ahead of an earnings statement due on Thursday, and Barratt Developments was 11-1/4 weaker at 118.Meanwhile, REIT Brixton lost 23 at 224-3/4 on the back of a disappointing set of interim results.The firm swung to a pretax loss in the first half and reported an 18 percent fall in adjusted net asset value, accompanied by a statement that the commercial property market has become more challenging due to the credit crunch and slowing economies. Merrill Lynch repeated its 'underperform' stance on Brixton.And finally, Punch Taverns and Marston's fell back after JP Morgan downgraded ratings for both in a review of the UK pubs sector included in a major review of the European Hotels&amp;amp;Leisure stocks.Punch shares dropped 26 to 266-3/4 and Marston's shed 11-1/2 at 194-1/4.
