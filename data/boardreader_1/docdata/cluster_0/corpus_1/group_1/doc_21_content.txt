 The New Zealand dollar stuck to a fairly narrow range today, having tried to make up ground after early data showed strong inflation pressures in parts of the economy.By 5pm, the kiwi was little changed at US70.84c, down from US70.87c late yesterday afternoon. Against the aussie, the kiwi rose to A81.50c from A81.19c. 'We're probably looking for more data to suggest the Reserve Bank will continue its easing cycle,' said Murray Hindley, chief foreign exchange dealer at ANZ Institutional Bank.The kiwi tried to rally after quarterly data showed that the prices paid and received by producers in the June quarter hit the highest levels in around a quarter of a century.However, that was considered of limited impact on inflation, because prices had fallen back, and because producer prices had little relation to retail prices, economists said. 'That was the only thing we've got out this week, so we're pretty much at the hands of the external marketplace,' Mr Hindley said. The kiwi also failed to find support after Australia's central bank said it saw a case for early interest rate cuts to head off a deeper economic slowdown despite persistent inflation across the Tasman.Overnight, the kiwi was expected to remain within 69.50c and 71.50c.Last night, it broke above US71c for the first time in 10 days, and hit a two-and-a-half month high against the aussie of nearly A81.95c, before giving up ground.The US dollar barely budged against a basket of currencies today after two-week surge, as investors kept an eye on commodity prices for any further drop that could boost the greenback. The US dollar index's push to a seven-month high has been reinforced by the slide in gold and oil as investors have rushed to unwind bets that the global economy would weather the US downturn and the credit crisis.Reuters currency rates: (5pm today - 5pm yesterday)NZ dlr/US dlr US70.84c - US70.87c NZ dlr/Aust dlr A81.50c - A81.19c NZ dlr/euro 0.4822 - 0.4806 NZ dlr/yen 77.88 - 78.10 NZ dlr/stg 37.97p - 37.92p NZ TWI 66.05 - 65.98 Australian dollar US86.91c - US87.26c Euro/US dollar 1.4693 - 1.4745 US dollar/yen 109.94 - 110.24
