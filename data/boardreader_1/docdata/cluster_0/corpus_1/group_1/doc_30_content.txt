 HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Asian markets jumped Monday as a recent decline in crude-oil prices inspired buying in automobile and airline stocks, while shares of regional exporters and financials gained after a sharp rally on Wall Street. But Shanghai stocks extended their losses on persistent worries about a slowing economy and high inflation. Toyota Motor Corp. stock rose sharply in Tokyo, helped by a newspaper report that the auto giant planned to raise domestic prices on some vehicles. China's Shanghai Composite, which slumped 4.5% on Friday, declined 1.1% to 2,576.72 recently, on worries the country's economy could slow down after the ongoing Olympic Games. But some analysts said such concerns were exaggerated. 'The slowdown in China is an undeniable fact, but we think the worries are a bit overdone. We expect the Olympic Games to have small negative impact on production and demand [in the July-September quarter], and we see a rebound post the Olympics on pent-up demand,' wrote Merrill Lynch economists in a note. Inflation worries were also in play, after official data showed China's producer price index climbed 10% in July from a year earlier, hitting its highest level since 1996. The wholesale inflation figures for the month mark the 12th straight month of increases, and follow an 8.8% rise in June. Hong Kong stocks advanced after the pre-weekend rally on Wall Street. The benchmark Hang Seng Index recently climbed 1.3% to 22,159.72. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average gained 1.7% to 13,394.37. Elsewhere, Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 5,004.90 and South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.2% to 1,588.07. Singapore's Straits Times index was little changed at 2,834.15, giving up early gains, and Taiwan's Taiex rose 1.4%, while New Zealand's NZX 50 index added 0.5%. Shares of Toyota (JP:7203: news, chart, profile) (TM:TMNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) advanced 3.5% after the Nikkei business daily reported the company planned to raise prices on hybrid and commercial vehicles in Japan by 1% to 3%. Toyota would exclude other models such as the Corolla subcompact and the Crown luxury sedan from the price increases, the report added. Airlines and other automobile companies jumped after September crude-oil futures slumped $4.82 a barrel to $115.20 a barrel Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract recently added as much as $1.40 to $116.60 a barrel in electronic trading. Shares of Korean Air Co.
