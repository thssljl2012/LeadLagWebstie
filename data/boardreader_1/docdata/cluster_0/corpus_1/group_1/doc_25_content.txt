 LONDON (SHARECAST) - Barclays has had a tough day as two brokers issued downbeat updates over the bank. Goldman Sachs suggested Barclays may need to make more hefty write downs over the next 18 months, with the US broker adding it is concerned about its balance sheet. Goldmans said Barclays' interim results were disappointing with only a good performance on costs helping them Cazenove, meanwhile, downgraded Barclays to 'in-line' from 'outperform,' saying that the shares have performed well recently despite the general financial turmoil and have run far enough for now. Mining plays Antofagasta, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Xstrata, Ferrexpo, Vedanta , Anglo American and Kazakhmys are all among the top performers while oil stocks Petrofac and Cairn Energy occupy the remaining places in the top 10 best performers.
