 HOUSING affordability remains at a 24-year low and is unlikely to significantly improve in the short term even if mortgage rates fall, the Housing Industry Association warns.The HIA /Commonwealth Bank First Home Buyer Affordability Index was flat during the June quarter, to be 6 per cent lower than the previous year. HIAs chief economist Harley Dale said its looking likely the Reserve Bank will lower official interest rates next month. If that flows onto lower home loan rates, he said it would ease some of the affordability strains homeowners are currently facing, but wouldnt make things much easier. When youre trying to recover affordability levels from 24-year lows youre going to need quite some period of time of sustained improvement to make it easier for first time buyers, he said. According to the HIA/CBA index, the monthly loan repayments on a typical first-home mortgage rose 1 per cent, to $2827 from $2799. This means typical first time buyers are now putting 28.5 per cent of their total income on their mortgage. The median first home price edged up to $425,600 in the June quarter, from $424,600 in the March quarter. The report showed that houses became less affordable in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, regional Queensland and regional South Australia over the June quarter. Mr Dale doesnt expect to see significant improvements in housing affordability until the 2009/2010 financial year. For housing to become more affordable he said there needs to be an improvement on the supply side, as well as lower rates. In order to boost supply, it needs to be easier to build a new home.Mr Dale said the high cost of land as well as state and local government fees and charges and hefty stamp duties all added considerably to the cost of building a home. He wants to see co-operation across all levels of government to help reduce some of the taxes and charges associated with building as well as speed up the approval process. Share this article
