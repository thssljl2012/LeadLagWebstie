 THE Australian dollar closed weaker today, dropping almost one US cent and reaching its lowest level in almost four months after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) hinted interest rates may be on their way down.At 1700 AEST, the Australian dollar was trading at 92.18 US cents, down from yesterday's close of 93.15 cents. During the day, the Australian dollar traded between a low of 92.14 US cents - its weakest level since touching 92.06 cents on April 14 - and a high of 93.00 US cents. The RBA left the cash rate on hold at 7.25 per cent for the fifth successive month following its August board meeting in Sydney today. RBA governor Glenn Stevens said the scope for a rate cut was building after the bank picked up signs of slowing domestic demand. 'The board's view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing,'' Mr Stevens said after the meeting. Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief currency strategist Richard Grace said parity with the US dollar was no longer attainable for the Australian dollar. 'Our forecasts had the Australian dollar reaching a peak of parity to the US dollar at the end of the September quarter before depreciating into year end,'' Mr Grace said. 'We now believe the Australian dollar has reached a peak early in the September quarter and will be adjusting our forecasts over coming days to reflect that view.'' The Australian dollar posted a 25-year high of $US0.9849 on July 16, levels not seen since the days of a fixed exchange rate. Mr Grace said rate cuts across the Tasman would also weigh on the Australian dollar as investors concluded that if New Zealand was cutting rates Australia 'cannot be too far behind'' despite the difference in economies. The Australian dollar finished at 99.37 Japanese yen, down from Monday's local close of 100.35, and at 59.33 euro cents, down from 59.78 cents. The euro finished at 1.5540 US dollars, down from Monday's close of 1.5579 US dollars and at 167.52 Japanese yen, down from 167.84 yen. The US dollar closed the local session at 107.81 yen, up from 107.74 yen.
