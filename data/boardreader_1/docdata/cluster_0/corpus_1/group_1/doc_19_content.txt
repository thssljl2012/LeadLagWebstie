 THE dollar closed lower today, losing more than one US cent as commodity prices eased and the US dollar rallied.At 5pm (AEST), the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.8652, down about 1.3 US cents from Friday's close of 0.8786.During the day, the local currency moved between a low of $US0.8616 and a high of 0.8691. The dollar suffered the bulk of its decline on Friday night, dropping below $US0.8700 on weaker commodity prices and a stronger US dollar. Crude oil for October delivery fell $US6.59 to settle at $US114.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil reached a record high of $US147.27 on July 11. Although oil was steady through Asian trading today, gold and silver prices were a little softer. At the same time, the US dollar posted gains against the euro, Japanese yen and UK pound sterling. Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist John Horner said falling commodity prices and a stronger US dollar 'dragged the Aussie lower'. Mr Horner said he expected the unit to drop below $US0.8500 despite some 'near-term' support around its recent low of $US0.8593 reached on August 13. 'The downward trend now is firmly in place and we will go through those supports,' Mr Horner said. Adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the local currency was next week's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) monthly board meeting, which was widely tipped to result in an interest rate cut. 'With an RBA rate cut cycle imminent, that should continue to weigh on the Australian dollar, as well as the stronger US dollar and weaker commodity price trends,' Mr Horner said. Deutsche Bank expected the euro to reach $US1.4500 before declining further towards $US1.3000 over the next 12 to 18 months. 'We're not expecting the US dollar to continue to appreciate at the pace we've seen in the past month, but we're looking for it to strengthen over the medium term,' Mr Horner said. Direction for the overnight session was expected to come from US housing data, with existing home sales numbers for July to be released.Share this article
