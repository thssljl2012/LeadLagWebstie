 SYDNEY, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 2.1 percent on Tuesday as fresh credit jitters in the United States saw financial stocks such as National Australia Bank  sold off. Sentiment was also soured by weak earnings reports from companies including insurance and banking group Suncorp-Metway Ltd , which reported a 48 percent drop in profit on turbulence on global credit markets and higher claims [nSYD38675]. On Wall Street, shares fell for the first time in four days on Monday as the financial sector came under pressure on worries about credit ratings of leading insurer America International Group Inc . 'The fall is pretty much as anticipated because of what happened overnight in the U.S,' said David Land, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets. 'Investors are probably trying to take some profit after yesterday's gains.' The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200  fell 104.9 points to 4,910.0 by 0038 GMT, more than wiping out a 1.7 percent gain on Monday. New Zealand's benchmark NZ-50 index fell 1.1 percent, or 43.10 points, to 3,283.82. Telecom Corp of New Zealand , the most heavily weighted stock, was down 3.3 percent at NZ$3.27.

Troubled investment firm Babcock &amp;amp; Brown Ltd  fell 4.7 percent to A$2.43. 0037 GMT Woolworths Ltd , Australia's largest supermarket chain, fell 1.6 percent to A$26.44, after it disappointed the market by dropping plans for a capital return. It also reported a 26 percent rise in annual profit and gave an upbeat outlook [nSYD38722]. 00036 GMT * Fairfax Media Ltd , a newspaper and online publishing group, rose 0.4 percent to A$2.85 after announcing plans to slash its workforce by 5 percent and take a A$50 million restructure charge [nSYU005014]. 0035 GMT * Medical centre operator Primary Health Care Ltd  fell 6.5 percent to A$5.05 after reporting a little changed annual operating profit [nSYU005013]. 0035 GMT . ng
