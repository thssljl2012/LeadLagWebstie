  By Jamie DunkleySterling's slide against the dollar is set to continue for the rest of the year, according to Britain's biggest banks, as the country's economy weakens further.Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland all expect the pound to weaken further, with the steepest declines coming against the dollar.Sterling has already slumped to its lowest in 12 years on a trade-weighted index, which measures it against a basket of currencies, as the outlook for the UK economy darkens.David Bloom, the head of currency strategy at HSBC, warned that sterling was 'going to hell in a handbag', and expects it to end the year at $1.75. The world's foreign-exchange traders are now dumping sterling more aggressively after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King yesterday gave the most explicit signal yet that the Bank is more likely to cut than raise interest rates.Should the Bank of England embark on series of rate cuts, the gap between the level of interest rates in America is likely to close and make the pound less attractive to investors.Trevor Williams, chief economist at Lloyds TSB, added that: 'For a while we have felt sterling was overvalued against the dollar and felt a deterioration was inevitable. We expect the US economy to recover further, which will make sterling fall even further. 'Britain has a huge trade deficit with the US, which is too big to sustain the high value of the pound. In the long run it could actually fall to as low as $1.50-$1.60, although this won't happen overnight. A value of between $1.70and $1.80 is more likely in the near future.' City experts expect sterling to fare better against the euro because the European economy is also sliding toward recession. Europe's gross domestic product fell by 0.2pc in the eurozone, which comprises the 15 nations that subscribe to the single currency, official statistics showed today.Paul Robson of Royal Bank of Scotland: 'I expect sterling to weaken against the euro over the next few weeks, perhaps to 80p as the Bank of England is set to lower interest rates before the ECB. 'However, once it becomes clear that the ECB is also set to reduce interest rates, the euro will start slipping against sterling.'
