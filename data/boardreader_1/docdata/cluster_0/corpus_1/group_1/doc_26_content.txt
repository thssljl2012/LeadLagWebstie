 TOKYO, Japan -- The dollar slipped against the yen in Asian trade Tuesday on fresh worries about the health of US mortgage giants, dealers said.But the greenback rose against the euro on fears of deteriorating German business sentiment.The dollar eased to 109.80 yen in Tokyo morning trade from 110.09 in New York late Monday. The euro slipped to $1.4681 from $1.4696 and to 161.22 yen from 161.83.Currency markets took their cue from a slump on Wall Street after a report that mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in need of a government bailout, dealers said.Another report that US investment bank Lehman Brothers would post a loss of $1.8 billion for the third quarter added to market worries that the credit crunch is far from over.The yen tends to benefit from jitters on the financial market because it is often used to fund risky trades.Markets were waiting for a German business sentiment survey due out later in the day that was expected to reflect worsening conditions in the euro zone's biggest economy, dealers said.The dollar last week jumped to a six-month high against the euro and its strongest level since January against the yen on worries that the fallout from the US financial crisis was spreading to other major economies. 'The rebound in the dollar over the past month reflects a sharp worsening in economic conditions globally rather than any improvement in the US,' National Australia Bank strategist John Kyriakopoulos wrote in a note to clients.If the dollar's recovery is to continue it will require signs that the economies of Europe, Asia and Australasia are deteriorating, he said.The Bank of Japan was due to wrap up a two-day meeting on interest rates Tuesday, with traders bracing for a more cautious assessment by the central bank on prospects for Asia's biggest economy.Faced with concerns about a weak economy and the fastest inflation in a decade, many analysts expect the Bank of Japan to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5 percent for the rest of this year.
