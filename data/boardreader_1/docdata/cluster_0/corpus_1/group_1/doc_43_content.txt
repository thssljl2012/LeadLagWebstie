 LIKE horses being dragged to water, Australia's major banks are still showing a reluctance to drink.Home borrowers are looking to the banks to deliver the full benefit of the anticipated official rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia next month. After saying there was only 'a likelihood' it would pass on any cut by the RBA, the ANZ pledged 'a full flow-on' to customers. The National Australia Bank promised to deliver a cut of 25 basis points but left open the question of any further cuts. It also sidestepped the issue of whether reductions would be passed on to credit card holders and business borrowers. Westpac and the Commonwealth made reassuring noises that they would pass on as much of the rate cut as they could, but their silence on credit card rates and personal loans remained stony. While Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan has urged banks to cut their rates, inflation is being driven in large part by bank lending margins and account and credit card fees. Last quarter they climbed by almost 10 per cent for a yearly rise of 16.2 per cent, the highest of any other sector of the economy. Little wonder that former treasurer Peter Costello made the point this week that Australians were starting to feel genuinely concerned that household wealth was going backwards.Share this article
