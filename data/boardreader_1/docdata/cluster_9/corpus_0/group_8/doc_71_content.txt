       "Yeah Bay-beeeee!!!" -- Dick VitaleYesterday we kicked off our March series called "Madne$$."&#0160; We're taking a topic EVERYONE is dealing with right now...the "full-court" economic pressure our society is under.  Yesterday's topic?&#0160; "Survive &amp; Advance" -- How can we deal with the FEAR that every headline, news story, market update &amp; office rumor seems to send our way???  Here are a few thoughts from week 1. The Story -- I LOVE the story of Mark 4:35-41.&#0160; I love how much I can RELATE to those guys.&#0160; I love how WEIRD Jesus seems to act...at the same time showing us what should be considered NORMAL.&#0160; I love how those guys were TOTALLY changed by Jesus.&#0160; It's an awesome story. The Rest of the Story -- If you want to see how the other writers capture this story, check out Matthew 8:23-27 &amp; Luke 8:22-25. Fear Suc...errrr...Stinks -- Guys?&#0160; There's a SERIOUS reason that "Do not fear" is the most-mentioned command in all the Bible.&#0160; We all struggle with it. Fear torments you - 1 John 4:18 Fear eats you up - Psalm 73:19 Fear doesn't come from God - 2 Timothy 1:7   Feedback -- One of our members grabbed me &amp; said their "God-moment" was when we talked about Jesus promising to get the PEOPLE to safety, but NOT the boat!!! $20 Billion Oops -- Speaking of the economy, did you see the "Whoops!&#0160; 'My Bad' for taking $20 Billion from the Government" statement by Bank of America? The Bricklayer -- I shot some baskets at the start of each service.&#0160; Horrible.&#0160; I have now named myself "The Bricklayer."&#0160; Went great in practice, but need that in the game!&#0160; :-)  Next week's topic?&#0160; A PERFECT topic for March Madness... "Cinderella Story" -- How can we flourish in our careers in the middle of this market chaos?
