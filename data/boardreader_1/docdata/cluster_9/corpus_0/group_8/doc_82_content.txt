     Someone in the ad biz must have rented Monty Python's Life of Brian or seen Spamalot recently --- because while we're all being crucified by this economy, advertisers are now telling us that we should "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."First case in point -- the dour Quaker Oats man is now cheering us all on, with the campaign theme of "Go Humans, Go."&#0160; In fact, when I was passed by a bus bearing the Quaker Guy's image on its side, I thought I detected a hint of a smile on his face for the first time.&#0160; As the NYTimes reports, the Quaker Man and the whole oats division of PepsiCo "are clambering aboard a fast-moving marketing bandwagon by offering upbeat exhortations during these tough economic times."&#0160; It's new website features a cool animated ad showing a businessman (who apparently hasn't lost his job yet) flying to work with a duel-carton Quaker Oat jet-pack powering him.&#0160; The Times sites other go-go-happy-happy ads including "More people go with Visa," Sara Lee's "Go Meat," Bank of America's "Bank of Opportunity," and Coke's "Open Happiness" campaign.&#0160; I would add to this list Comcast's new "Singalong" ads featuring regular looking folks singing a clever Happy-Go-Lucky ditty about the wonders of Comcast.&#0160; Advertising Age says this happy ad is particularly noteworthy, due to Comcast's image as an evil, non-consumer friendly cable company.&#0160; "Remember, this isn't a nice, eco-friendly hybrid they're jingling goofily about," says AdAge.&#0160; "It's the freakin' cable company, which -- after all the singing is done -- you can't help feeling better about."So with one successful ad campaign, Comcast isn't evil anymore.&#0160; But there's plenty of financial companies ready to take its place in the hearts and minds of consumers.&#0160; Maybe TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab should take a hint --- and instead of addressing the glum economy head-on, come up with a cute jingle to take the pain away.&#0160; And maybe Eric Idle could sing it.&#0160;&#0160;Some things in life are bad,They can really make you mad,Other things just make you swear and curse,When you're chewing life's gristle,Don't grumble,Give a whistleAnd this'll help things turn out for the best.And...Always look on the bright side of life.
