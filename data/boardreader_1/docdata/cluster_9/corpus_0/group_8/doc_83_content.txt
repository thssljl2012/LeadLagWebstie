             According to an article in the September 21, 2006 San Diego-Union Tribune, a bank robber suspect dubbed the Bumbling Bandit was arrested on August 29th.  Earlier that month on August 12th it is alleged that this hapless bandit, robbed a Bank of America in the San Diego suburb of Grantsville, California.    According to witnesses, the BB (bungling bandit) entered the bank lobby with a gun, his face covered with a Ronald Reagan mask and wearing a long cape.   After banishing the gun, BB was given money, but that was about the only thing that went right that day. Running away from the robbery scene, BB had trouble seeing clearly out of the eyeholes of the Ronald Reagan mask, and his handgun got tangled up in his cape, and down he went..in the bank lobby. Oh, that was not the end of this caper (pun intended).   BB managed to make it to his get-away car, an SUV parked near the bank, but he found that the SUV was blocked front and rear by delivery vehicles, so he had to smash his way out of the parking space. Inching his way back and forth he finally managed to plow his way back to the roadway.  It was about this time that the red dye in the bandits money bag went off forcing him to abandon his SUV. The police found the SUV with the mask he had used, a gun and a $50 bill.  Maybe, you think, good ole boy BB learned his lesson about parking get away cars. Guess again, BB still has problems in selecting parking places, in fact his lack of selecting parking space, is the reason he was captured.  BB was arrested on the campus of UCSD because he parked in a parking spot reserved for the university faculty.  Evidence found in his car linked him to the Grantville bungled bank robbery. And his DNA matched that of DNA on the mask he left in the SUV. Yes BB, needs education, and I dont think anyone will ever mistake him for a faculty member of a university. A Ronald Reagan mask? Long cape? Thought youd enjoy this one.If you love America, you will love this
