You can't open the business section without finding a story involving a bailout. Now this concept has leaped into the sports pages with the recent announcement that the NBA will be extending a lifeline to select NBA franchisesthrough a newly established 200 million dollar line of credit.       It is expected that as many as 12 teams will access these funds to the tune of thirteen to twenty million dollars each. At present there is no knowledge of any restrictions that come with these dollars and no teams have been identified by the league office as recipients.   Commissioner David Stern is refusing acknowledge to term these funds as bailouts. Instead he is choosing to use the availability of these funds as a positive sign of the credit worthiness of the NBA.       Speculation is rampant as to what teams will take advantage of this opportunity. Sacramento has gone on record as a willing recipient but others teams which might be struggling have not been so forthcoming.    While other minor leagues have shuttered operations during these harsh economic times the NBA is the first to extend extra credit to teams. It will be interesting to see if this emerges as a trend.
