I'd like to invite all my facebook friends to visit a new blog featuring myself, Barbara Cameron, Amy Clipston, and best-selling author Beth Wiseman. Amish Hearts is about all things Amish--Amish fiction, community, recipes, photos, giveaways, and more. Currently we are offering a drawing for a copy of Beth's CBA best-seller, Plain Perfect, for visitors who comment on the blog. I'm very excited about this new venture--these are fantastically talented ladies, and I'm privileged to be included with them. If you're a fan of Amish fiction or just curious, please visit Amish Hearts. Thanks!www.AmishHearts.com
