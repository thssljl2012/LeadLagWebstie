         I went to a performance the other night and before the show started the announcer asked everyone to turn off their cell phones and pagers. Then the announcer stated that the show was "brought to you by Bank of America". There was an uncomfortable silence in the auditorium and then a big "BOO!"More brilliance from Jon Stewart below. Thanks to MW for mentioning this to me.
