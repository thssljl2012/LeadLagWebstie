New One-Act Play!The Five Dollar WomanThe ten-minute drama "God in My History", an Australian celebration of the power of God through a willing vessel, has been renamed and remodelled."The Five Dollar Woman" is now available for 8 actors (4 male, 4 female) for use on a functioning theatre stage.  Stage charts are provided for prop positioning, actor entrance and exit directions (all operating from stage left), and actor movement on stage.The play is still available in Convention format, but participants need to know it requires speedy costume changes because actors play more than one role -- meaning creativity and lots of practice!The kit is not available in colour at this time.
