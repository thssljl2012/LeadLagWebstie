Good morning!  Two things came up today I wanted to let you know about.  First, is an interesting tid bit from the newspaper.  It seems the police and a St. George, Utah bank are looking for a woman who brought 14 gold St. Gaudins coins into the bank to exchange for cash.  They are estimated to be worth about $18,000 to $20,000 depending on year and condition.  The woman received $280 for them as banks only deal in face value money.  Needless to say, they are worth many times the cost of the groceries she had waiting for her in Wal-Mart, where they refused the coins in payment for the items.The other is that Mt. Redoubt in Alaska erupted 2 more times on Saturday, sending ash 50,000 feet into the atmosphere again.  I am wondering if volcanic eruptions are ever figured into the climate change figures that are supposed to be only for "man made" greenhouse gasses?Off to visit with family today.  We still have 7 inches of snow, so no metal detecting this weekend. :-(Good Prospecting to You,ShirleyMining Equipment
