Really, five whole diggers! Today the sun is shining but it&#8217;s mighty chilly out there! I decided to get out sharpish this morning before any CBA set in and bundled Hector into the running buggy before he settled into his morning play-time. We packed his new spade (or &#8216;dave&#8217; as he says it!) and his scooper and set off to Finsbury Park. These weekday runs are so different from my weekend sessions, and it&#8217;s a challenge just to get out of the house sometimes - anyone with a young child will know what I mean: you never just get up and go, there are nappy changes and so on and all the bits and bobs you need to remember to take with you to make everything run smoothly. I have decided to lighten up a bit about these runs and not be too hard on myself for not making the set distance on my schedule, the long runs are key to this training and I am doing just fine with those right now. There was a lot of stopping and starting, so when I did get a stretch of running I really went for it and it felt good. I do love a hill, but pushing the running buggy up is another thing entirely and I feel such a sense of achievement at the top. Gasp, gasp. We stopped at the sandpit and did some serious digging, then Hector decided he would like to go for a walk, so we wandered alongside the &#8216;unning tat&#8217; and took in the birds along the way. I am always amazed at his sense of direction, he really gets a sense of where things are very quickly. This is impressive but also slightly irritating when you want to go in the opposite direction and he is shouting &#8216;ome!&#8217; when you are trying to get an extra lap in as I attempted to do this morning! I didn&#8217;t do the eight miles stated, just five and a bit, but I felt good and it&#8217;s another run ticked off the list.
