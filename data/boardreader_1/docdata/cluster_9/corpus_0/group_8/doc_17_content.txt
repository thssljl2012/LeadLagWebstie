Recently I purchased these books on the recommendation of Colleen Coble. Colleen is a CBA bestselling author, and when she recommends something, I tend to listen. I was also familiar with Jeff Gerke, an author and editor who has recently opened up his own publishing house, Marcher Lord Press. So I knew the books had to be good. I had no idea how excellent they were until I started using them. Normally I don't have a problem with creating characters. I've been told characterization is one of my strengths, with plot being the weakest. But my most recent book is filled with characters that intertwine throughout three books. I also have a two romances and two plots going on in this book, so I wasn't surprised when my editor pointed out that my characters needed work. I spent a week using Character Creation, and by the time I was finished I knew my characters inside and out. This made the revision process much, much easier. The great thing about Character Creation is that its interactive. There are worksheets you can fill out on the computer and a tool called Char-Pick that helps in the quick creation of minor characters. The book explains the steps in creating well-rounded, memorable characters, and Jeff has an easy going writing style which makes for quick reading and understanding. I didn't use How to Find Your Story as much during my revisions because I already had my story in place. But I read through it and Jeff's insights and advice helped me pinpoint where my current plot had derailed, and how to get back on track. I can't recommend these books highly enough. I won't write another novel without them. Currently Marcher Lord Press is offering both books for one low price, which is an absolute bargain. I have writing craft books on my shelf that I paid much more for that aren't half as helpful. For more information on these books and Marcher Lord Press, click here.
