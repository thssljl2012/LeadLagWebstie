I just realised that I posted an entry towards the end of October basically saying I don't like Gaby. Yet, a week or two prior to that, I adored her. Basically, we had an arguement and now she hates me. Mmhmm. Not bothered and not going into details (cba). The reason I bring it up now is because Kyrra's decided to email me and blow it up again, stropping with me and also because it doesn't make much sense to anyone if I don't explain it a little. But yeah. They're both dicks and I couldn't care less about them at the moment.That's all :)
