I pulled into the parking lot of the Bank of America on my way home tonight. Only I didn't need to go to the bank, and if I had, I wouldn't have gone to that bank.I don't have an account at it.I stopped because there was a truck stopped in a traffic lane on Cork St. The trucks hazard lights are flashing, and a man is standing in the grass next to it. So I get out into the cold and jog down to this cat and say, "Hey friend, you want ta push it down to the banks parking lot?"Over the sound of passing traffic he asked me twice to repeat myself. Then he says, "Oh no, there's nothing wrong with my truck, my daughter got into an accident a couple blocks back and I'm just watching to see if the police have arrived."Ok.Let me get this straight, you decided to park your vehicle in a traffic lane at 5pm so you can watch what's happening at a fender bender a hundred yards back.What?Get. Out. Of. The. Street. Dipshit.
