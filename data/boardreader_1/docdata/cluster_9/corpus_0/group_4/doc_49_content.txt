 ok, miz &amp;amp; morrison got booked to battle carlito &amp;amp; primo (i think vickie guerrero did it while i was asleep) in san diego, but camp pendelaton is just north of san diego, so all they have to do is jump on a C-140 and fly into cleveland hopkins airport with all his freinds if they still want to do the WWE halloween event i authorized at the IX center in cleveland if they wanted the $1 million to do the WWE halloween event at the IX center in cleveland that i had authorised or since  the RAW 800th anniversary celebration is this&amp;nbsp;monday with  a&amp;nbsp;3 hour episode featuring miz &amp;amp; morrison v. HHH &amp;amp; shawn&amp;nbsp;  michaels (the 800th episode actually already aired on Sept. 22, 2008 from the US Bank Arena in Cincinnati, Ohio).&amp;nbsp; the  WWE party can be delayed&amp;nbsp;until monday nov. 3rd after the  800th episode celebration of RAW in tampa, florida.&amp;nbsp; this may work out better since&amp;nbsp;WWE divas: chyna, sable, ashley, and maria have obligations to be at the playboy halloween party especially since this may be Hef's last party at the  mansion (i think he is&amp;nbsp; about to retire.&amp;nbsp; of course, i offered to take over for him)!&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; since the australia celebrity cruise got booked up and since HHH got booked for monday (most likely because of vickie guerrero when i was asleep.&amp;nbsp; now you know why so many people hate vickie guerrero and constantly boo her when she gets into the ring and why she was supposed to be fired.&amp;nbsp; it was also due to her neck injuries, which is a liability for the owners.&amp;nbsp; it was safer to fire her), i am going to post another  cruise for the WWE.&amp;nbsp; this will give shawn michaels another  chance to win the $1 million for lorne michaels and the SNL  crew for a cruise as i previously posted if shawn michaels  wins a major WWE event (i felt bad when he lost against  jericho at no mercy and losing the $1 million for a SNL&amp;nbsp;cruise).&amp;nbsp;  and once again, all the WWE divas, all my lady disciples, and even all the playboy bunnies will be invited (since Hef is about  to retire and i offered to take up the helm for him)! &amp;nbsp; the australia celebrity cruise is still going on from nov. 2&amp;nbsp;to  nov. 14 i had already delegated hosting it to: nicole kidman, mel gibson, and russel crowe, it is still to raise funds for future australian films, but like i said these celebrity cruises sell out  quick.  &amp;nbsp; ok, here's a good celebrity cruise i found for WWE &amp;amp; SNL  celebrity cruise sched. dec. 12 to dec. 21 from baltimore to the bahamas and back... &amp;nbsp; from http://vacationstogo.com/fastdeal.cfm?deal=11313 &amp;nbsp;   ..TR&gt;   ..TR&gt;   11313..TABLE&gt;  9 days departing December 12, 2009 onCelebrity's Mercury      ..TR&gt; Cheapest Inside $699..TABLE&gt;   ..TR&gt; Cheapest Oceanview $849..TABLE&gt;      ..TR&gt; Cheapest Balcony $1,149..TABLE&gt;   ..TR&gt; Cheapest Suite $1,849..TABLE&gt;    No brochure rates were provided by Celebrity.

King James Version: Revelation Chapter 7 1&amp;nbsp;And after these things I saw four angels standing on the  four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,  that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea,  nor on any tree. 2&amp;nbsp;And I saw another angel ascending from the east,  having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice  to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth  and the sea, 3&amp;nbsp;Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,  till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. 4&amp;nbsp;And I heard the number of them which were sealed:  and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four  thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. 5&amp;nbsp;Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand.  Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand.  Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. 6&amp;nbsp;Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand.  Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand.  Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand. 7&amp;nbsp;Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand.  Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand.  Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. 8&amp;nbsp;Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand.  Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand.  Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. 9&amp;nbsp;After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude,  which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds,  and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and  before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms  in their hands; 10&amp;nbsp;And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our  God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. 11&amp;nbsp;And all the angels stood round about the throne,  and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before  the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, 12&amp;nbsp;Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and  thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto  our God for ever and ever. Amen. 13&amp;nbsp;And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What  are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence  came they? 14&amp;nbsp;And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,  These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the  Lamb. 15&amp;nbsp;Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him  day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne  shall dwell among them. 16&amp;nbsp;They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither  shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. 17&amp;nbsp;For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed  them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and  God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. altho, cre was a notorious pothead since he used to be&amp;nbsp;a greatful dead roadie, the other big promotors behind 420, like myself actually had a  very large disdain for cannibis, esecially after al quida jinx who got  smart bar busted due to his under-age drinking, metropolis busted due  to his cocaine trafficking, burned down the EPT house for an insurance scam (if that wasn't a big enough clue for 9/11 and the cali wildfires,  i don't know what is),&amp;nbsp; red zone busted due to his gang killing someone  at red zone, was the central figure behind the 420 riots, bragged&amp;nbsp;the world  trade center building would be the ultimate insurance scam right before 9/11,  framed bin laden (because the bin ladens were the largest investor in the  bush family) to start the war on afghanistan, falsely accused my people of opium (when in reality asians regard opium as jews regard swastikas ever  since the&amp;nbsp;chinese emperor hacked heads to get opium out of china before)  to justify stealing imported asian goods to keep for themselves or to sell on  the&amp;nbsp;black market costing america $125 billion dollars loss of business since  union port workers couldnt&amp;nbsp;work, teamsters truck drivers couldnt work, and&amp;nbsp; stores like wal-mart&amp;nbsp;couldn't get their inventory for&amp;nbsp;125 days at a billion dollars  loss of business a day, tricked the mormon morons to&amp;nbsp;hate mexicans sparking  5&amp;nbsp;years of cali wildfires caused $6 billion dollars property damage, 2000 burnt down homes, 1 million displaced southern californians, and&amp;nbsp;40 deaths (not  counting dead undocumented&amp;nbsp;mexicans), tricked america into the war on iraq  with that forged document alleging saddam attempted to obtain yellow cake to  enrich depleted uranium&amp;nbsp;from niger, africa to justify&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;start of the war on iraq that cost america $1 trillion, 4000 US soldiers their lives, over 30,000 came  back injured mostly due to IED attacks traced to gemany that sold WWII bomb  shells to african rebels&amp;nbsp;aka al quida that converted them into IED's, west nile  virus attack on gov. schwarzenegger that resulted in 300 cases of west nile virus and 12 deaths, bringing in other deadly diseases from africa like: AIDS, anthrax, e.boli, e.coli, west nile virus, avian bird flu, malaria, salmonella, etc., as well as telemarketing scams, internet scams, identity theft scams, credi...
