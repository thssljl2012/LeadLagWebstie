Since the HAIFers here are all highly educated, interested in their city, and more full of opinions than a turkey is full of stuffing, let's make a list of the city's most beloved buildings.Everyone nominate you favorites.  Whichever buildings get the most nominations will make it into the top ten, and then we'll vote to rank them.I nominate:Williams TowerJPMorgan Chase TowerJPMorgan Chase Building (Formerly the Gulf Building)Esperson BuildingsRiver Oaks TheaterThe Elder Street Artists Lofts (Formerly the old old Jefferson Davis Hospital)FWIW, HAI has a top-ten list of its own that it automatically compiles based on page views, searches, and other automated factors.  That list is:Williams TowerElder Street Artists LoftsJPMorgan Chase Bank BuildingJPMorgan Chase TowerBank of America CenterNew Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral1500 LouisianaWells Fargo Bank PlazaEsperson BuildingsGlenwood Cemetery (not really a building, but that's what happens when you use automation)You can view the full list with pictures here (scroll down a bit): http://www.houstonarchitecture.info/Search.php?ID=0
