Last Friday, I wanted to surprise Winemonkey with a massage at Mellow Me Out. So I told him that we had an &amp;#8220;Appointment, err,, I mean reservation&amp;#8221; and that he needed to pick me up from work at 4:30. The whole week, I played it up like we were going to an early bird special or a dinner far away. I believe he had no idea what was going on. So when he picked me up at 4:30 on Friday and I drive us into the Bank of America parking lot, he was pretty confused.  I said, &amp;#8220;I think today is the day that we open a joint checking account.&amp;#8221;  And he says, &amp;#8220;At Bank of America?!?! I hate Bank of America. You know that I had an account with them before and I thought it was awful. What made you pick Bank of America?!? Did your financial panther tell you this was a good idea?&amp;#8221; And I say, &amp;#8220;Look it is the right time for us. And we really need to start saving.&amp;#8221; Winemonkey: &amp;#8220;Why aren&amp;#8217;t we opening a joint saving account.&amp;#8221; Me: &amp;#8220;We can discuss that once we are inside.&amp;#8221; Then we proceed to the second floor of the bank building, where the day spa is and he finally figures out that I am not making him open an account with me after all&amp;#8230; but treating him to a super duper massage. =) I love my little Winemonkey because is so much fun to surprise! Later he told me that he thought I was taking us to the bank so that we could sign papers for a home loan. Maybe next time my love&amp;#8230;. maybe next time.
