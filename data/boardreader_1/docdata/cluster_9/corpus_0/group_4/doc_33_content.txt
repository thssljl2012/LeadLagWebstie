The phrase "a good innings" is often rolled out when somebody dies, but Reg Varney, beloved star of On The Buses (and attendant box office-smashing movies) has died aged 92. That's 92. He was born in 1916. Varney seems to have done very little of note after On The Buses ended in 1973 - he did a series called Down The Gate in 1975, but I can't pretend to have heard of it; then he appeared in Eric Sykes' The Plank in 1979 before effectively retiring to paint and play the piano, both of which he did with much accomplishment. Anyway, let us praise him with this fact:On 27 June, 1967, Reg Varney was the first person in the world to use a cashpoint machine. The first ever electronic ATM was installed at Barclays Bank in Enfield, North London, and for reasons I have yet to specify, Reg was the first to use it, as shown in this picture.Gawd bless him and his turtleneck jumper and his eye for the clippies. (He was already in his fifties when he was chasing those birds with Jack down the depot.) Anyone younger than 40 will presumably struggle to place Reg, but it is their loss.
