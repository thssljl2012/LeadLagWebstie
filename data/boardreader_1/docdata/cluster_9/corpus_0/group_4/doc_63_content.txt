So&amp;nbsp;I won against the meat company. Ha got all my money back plus fees. The cops redid the police report. And we are going after the woman in small claims court to fix the damage biatch. but for now insurance is going to pay for it. WE drove all the was to Pensacola, FL to bank of America yesterday. 2 hrs...but we had like $2000 in my purse and I wasn't comfortable with having it there. So I went to my bank and deposited it, good way to waste a day. Then we got back I went to Regis and got my hair did and got it colored dark brown with red undertones. CUTE! Then I got home it was like 8 pm and Michael had made me a candlelight dinner chicken parm and whole wheat spagetti with homemade sauce. We stayed up watched Lipstick Jungle then we made huge sundays and ate in bed. Conked out! Perfect. That is our life. Oh I went to the college the other day and I switched my degree I am a little annoyed about it I had over 30 credit hours, but most of the classes I took towards my last degree I don't need for this one, so it is like almost starting over. I am going to K-6 education with emphasis in Reading. YEAH! I start in Jan have all my classes lined up.WE are on our way to get a turkey for Thanksgiving, then arts and craft show with Hannah, then maybe grocery shopping oh and of course a trip to Old Navy got to get some new clothes. Tomorrow we are going out on the boat. WHEW! Busy busy! Other than that not a whole lot going on around here. Michael and I have spent the whole morning that Hannah was asleep cuddling and talking it was nice. We are so wonderful together and it has only got better since we left Shady J. I can't believe we have already been married 2.5 years. Hannah is 19 mos old...I keep finding new reasons why we are blessed everyday. Ok I am off Hannah just got up and i need to get out of here. Love you guys have a sunny day
