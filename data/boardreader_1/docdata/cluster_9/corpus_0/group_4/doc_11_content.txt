I've been told 3 times this week by 3 completely different people throughout the US that I do not sound southern.::pauses while everyone rotfl their asses off at this::Yep.  I was on the phone with various customers at work, and one Bank of America employee who each told me that I didn't sound southern.  They all asked where I was located, I replied Atlanta, and one customer said: "Oh, you don't sound southern.  Where are you from?" afsdkjl;asfd;jklafsdj;klasfdkj;lasfdj;klasfdjkl;!!!!!I've got a coworker that I'm friends with that works in a different department.  She has a Spanish accent--her mom was from Madrid, and when I used to temp in her department people would get the two of us confused on the phone too.  So, not only do I NOT sound southern, but I also sound kinda Spanish too.  And this wasn't just from our customers, her own sister called and started talking to me in Spanish, which I of course could not understand, so even family members got us confused.What the hell?!?Maybe it's a sign that I've been watching way too much Doctor Who and have slipped back into my pseud-British sort accent thing I had when I was in London.  But that can't be right or else my family/friends would have mocked me by now.  So, I'm going to think that those people are just stupid and have watched Deliverance or The Dukes of Hazzard one too many times.  Cause that just makes more sense.  :)
