               I left work yesterday with my boss. We started chatting about a co-worker whose last day is on Friday. It's a shame really, because I really like the girl that is leaving. Anyway, as we are walking down Brookline Ave, two guys approach us."Do you guys know how to get to Comm Ave?"I mention it is good that they asked when they did, because they were headed in the completely wrong direction. I was walking in the direction they were, so I tagged along and pointed them to where they wanted to go. They then said they wanted to do the Freedom Trail, in which I replied that they'd probably want to take the T since it is about a 30 min+ walk from Kenmore. They said they wanted to walk. To each his own, right?Even though one of the guys is decked out in Red Sox shit, he definitely wasn't from around here. I find out they are from Indiana. I tell them where they can see the USS Constitution, Harvard, MIT, the works (I used to be a guide on a riverboat that goes up and down the Charles River).Once again, I mention the T, but they'd rather hoof it. Then, they ask me my name."I'm Joc."
