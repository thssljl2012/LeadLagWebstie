oh, the extremities. how odd it is to be so happy at one moment, and then an hour later, you feel like strangling everything in sight. i think i *MIGHT* have anger management issues. either that or i&amp;#8217;m just one hormonal being. although, *quote eileen*, being 20, our hormones are supposed to be stable. but there must be something wrong with you when you don&amp;#8217;t feel like seeing anybody at all, and the thought of talking to people makes you so sick. and you even contemplate going for the early, early church service so you won&amp;#8217;t see anyone. this is so not me. the stress of supervisions and internship apps are just starting to take its toll on me. so, maybe i should have listen to ji&amp;#8217;s advice and did my research and application crap over summer instead of lazing around and watching stupid shows on hbo everyday. thus, due to the events (or lack thereof) of the past few days, i have decided to go back over winter. i think if i stay in cambridge for the 5 weeks break, i will be like a candle with no wax left. READ : BURNT OUT. now, i just have to get my ticket. and i can&amp;#8217;t decide to go for mas or emirates. i hate transits, but i get to save 200 pounds (whichmeans200poundsmoreformetospendonnonsense) so. CBA perhaps? &amp;#8230; &amp;#8230; &amp;#8230; is it too much for me to just be HAPPY? i don&amp;#8217;t get it.
