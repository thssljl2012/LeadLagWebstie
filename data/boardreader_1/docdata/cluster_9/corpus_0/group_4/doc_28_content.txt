I dont like to get political on this blog, but I do feel it is time for change at Disneyland. Although I like Steve Martin as much as the next guy, the 3+ year old 50th Annniversary Film is getting a little creaky. It is definitely time to bring back the true classic, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. For you newbies who don't know about Ol' Abe, he used to be the star of the Opera House. Picture #1 for today shows Walt with WED Project Art Director Victor Greene, perusing the miniature for the "Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln" attraction, 1965. I sure hope that's not a cigarette in Victor's left hand! Photo #2 shows the Opera House complete with the Abe Lincoln marquee; love the giganormous penny! The little boy with the Confederate cap looks like he might be getting ready to blast the Bank of America.I've also included a close-up showing the Mr. Lincoln poster and the Tencennial lightpost banner.See more vintage &amp; current Main Street U.S.A. Opera House photos at my regular website.  ...
