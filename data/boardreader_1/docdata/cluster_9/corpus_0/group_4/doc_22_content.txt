okay so&amp;nbsp; i got talking to one of my ex's, who never fails to fuck me off.and guess what kiddies, he's done just that.Maan, now i remember why he's an ex.First off. &amp;quot;He doesn't love you, I do&amp;quot; who the fuck are you to judge?&amp;nbsp; when you had me you treated me like complete shit, and now i'm happy with someone else, you want me back. Well, fuck you.You don't know him, he's 10 times the man you fucking are, or ever bloody will be. If you really loved me, then you wouldn't have treated me like complete and utter shit.If you really loved me, you wouldn't have flirted and tried to get with my friends every time we had an argument or fell out.If you really pissing loved me you'd let me be happy, no matter who i'm with, not become some jealous cunt who keeps trying to worm his way back into my life.Secondly, what makes you think after the way you treated me thast i'd take you back, so what you apologised, so what you spilled your heart i some over rehearsed speech to win me back, i'll never forgive you for what you did, you really hurt me, and i'm not going to forgive you that fucking easily, if at all. You claim i take too much shit from people, you claim i'm too forgiving, yes, I know I am, but making a stand. You gave me so much shit when we were together,&amp;nbsp; what makes you think you've changed? what makes yoou think you've grown up in.. what is it... the last.. 4 or 5 months?&amp;nbsp; oh that's right, you haven't. If you claim i take too much shit, then stop giving me it!&amp;nbsp;Stop trying to poison my mind against those i love. cause you know damn well, that they will come out on top,&amp;nbsp;every fucking time :) Why can'tt you just fucking accept that I've found love and it's not with you ? I'm happy, with him, and that's not about to change anytime soon, and especially not for you. stop being so self centered and think about whats best for everyone not just yourself. I love Fuzzle, and that's that. he is mine and i am his. Not yours, His. So mer.:)Ugh i cba to rant anymore, I'd rather speak to My Fuzzle ^_______________^Kairiout ;) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
