I used to think that reading the FT was just to fulfill my duties as a student and possibly a researcher in the future. &amp;nbsp;But the FT&amp;nbsp;has so much more than that!!!&amp;nbsp; I found out that most of the economists they interview are from firms i've never heard before but are extremely prominent!! I think it's coz they're not banks.&amp;nbsp; So anyway, I found 2 super big firms, one's Capital Economics and another is NIESR.&amp;nbsp; Both require masters la, zzzz.&amp;nbsp; Talked to my tutor, and he told me the rankings for economics, but only undergrad rankings are available.&amp;nbsp; Plus most choose LSE&amp;nbsp;over Oxford coz oxford only offers 2 years, zzzz right?&amp;nbsp; Dont think so far yet, but i cant believe i actually found 2 freaking firms that specialise in macroeconomic research (even microeconomic research).&amp;nbsp; To tell you the truth, i wont mind working with micro for a bit, coz i realised that economists such as lucas and friedman actually used micro concepts like rational expectations, which used to apply to optimal choice making under constraints or something, to explain business cycles.&amp;nbsp; So i shall contribute to knowledge one day, just dont know when la.My life's really boring right now.&amp;nbsp; OT asked if i was going to lava, and i was like &amp;quot;erm, erm, no leh&amp;quot; and she was like &amp;quot;GO GO!!!!&amp;quot; but we met on the road so i just gave an excuse and left.&amp;nbsp; Zzzz, if it was me last year, i would have jumped at the chance!!!&amp;nbsp; Hahaha how times have changed.&amp;nbsp; I just counted, 6 weeks and 3 days to singapore, woohoo!!!&amp;nbsp; And the adoption of michelle's hamsters, for 4 weeks, yay :DThinks i want to do in singapore:Mug and work is a mustmeet annie, mich, mari, yinghong, aman, elsa, hui wen, many otherseat good foodVisit the doc/hospital for my spinespend quality time with champagne and my family apply for more internships (not for commercial private banks, since i'm not interested in them, except for barclays, hsbc, citi, which my tutor mentioned)eat and be merry (that is if i even have the time)persuade mum to come to uk during easter and pei me when i'm all alone mugging my ass off, or travelling in europe :DMUG IN NTU LIBRARY ALMOST EVERYDAY.&amp;nbsp; Or maybe just NLB since i'm lazy.&amp;nbsp; Must go all the way to LKC for my texts la.Food i want to&amp;nbsp;eat (already i miss them!!!)dao sah piah from balestier roadegg tarts from crystal jadecheese cake from secret recipeindulgzkorean foodjapanese foodthai foodvietnam food (the place where annie brought me to)Dao suanyam pastesteamed sweet potatolaksamee siammee rebusmee sotononya kuey kueyroti pratasting ray!!!!!!!!!!Poh piahfish porridgecentury egg porridgebaos and dim sumI think that's it really.&amp;nbsp; can i really eat them all in 4 weeks given the little time i'll allocate to recreational/leisure activities?&amp;nbsp; Mich says eat and be fat!!&amp;nbsp; I agree :D:D&amp;nbsp; I'm eating wayyyyyyy too much chocolates, crisps and fattening instant meals man.&amp;nbsp; And according to the food pyramid, these should constitute like only a small proportion of my diet.&amp;nbsp; muahaha, i'm a student, that's more than a reason in itself :D&amp;nbsp; Need to buy more crisps.&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow i shall be having 2 society meetings and 2 lectures, all spread out so i cannot really study.&amp;nbsp; Hmmm, shall study on friday.Christine's bday dinner on sat!!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'll be late but i'll not miss it.&amp;nbsp; Sunday it's the celebration with the house.&amp;nbsp; my weekend's gone.&amp;nbsp; Must mug doubly hard next week.&amp;nbsp; Welcome to the hardcore mugger's club.&amp;nbsp; We drink Mug 24/7 :D&amp;nbsp; i miss root beer already.
