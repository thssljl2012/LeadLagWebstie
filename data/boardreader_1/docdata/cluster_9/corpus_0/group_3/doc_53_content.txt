I have been looking for a job for the past few weeks and haven't come across any that i would enjoy doing, or would be relevant to my interests or are of sufficient pay.Just two nights ago, I decided to go online to start a round of job hunt again. I saw this listing at TD Bank wealth managemtn with the partner response team and decided to apply since the pay was pretty high and i really did enjoy my stint at barclays. Not having written a cover letter to go along with my resume before, I decided to try out writing one at 3am in the morning. I didn't feel too formal nor particularly polite, so I typed how I would talk to a professional I met on the street.And voila, the next day they called me up for an interview! Hohoho, PRAISE GOD! So I just came back from the interview and they said they wanted to employ me!Ah, too bad my next semester's schedule doesn't fit into their 20hour requirement. But still, thank God for that timely encouragement that I'm actually employable! Honestly, I felt pretty uncertain as how open the job market was to asian female student with no relevant educational background.And so I had pad thai as celebration for my job 'offer'. Haha, oddly, I had pad thai at the restaurant I applied to work at too. Will be going for that interview some time soon =DFirst things first - get this ESSAY out of the way.
