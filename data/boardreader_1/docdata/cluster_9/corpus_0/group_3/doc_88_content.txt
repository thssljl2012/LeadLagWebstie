So a few tidbits of Buffalo Sabres news have surfaced today. 1-Ryan Miller will be co-hosting the downtown Christmas Tree lighting ceremony/opening of the Buffalo Place skating rink on November 23rd with&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; SANTA! 2- Adam Mair was handed the CBA&amp;#8217;s largest fine of $2,500 today for yelling at someone who wasn&amp;#8217;t even there, even though Neil started it by calling Mair a punching bag. Can we not make things illegal in a locker room hallway if they aren&amp;#8217;t illegal in real life? My gosh. Guess what NHL?- if I run up to someone&amp;#8217;s front door while they aren&amp;#8217;t home and yell at them, they can&amp;#8217;t sue me. They can&amp;#8217;t do anything but tell me to stop it. If you&amp;#8217;re going to be overprotective, then at least be consistent. (i.e. DON&amp;#8217;T be overprotective) 3- Derek Roy says playing in the IIHF is like playing for the Stanley Cup. I bet losing there isn&amp;#8217;t half as bad as losing to Carolina. 4-Dave Ogrean loves us. 5- Goose is back in his roost. 6- Autographed hats will be sold in the arena tomorrow night pre-game ($20 eahc) for the &amp;#8220;Hockey Fights Cancer&amp;#8221; campaign. Probably some of the cheapest autopraghed Sabres merchandise you can find.  -PinkJerseysSuck
