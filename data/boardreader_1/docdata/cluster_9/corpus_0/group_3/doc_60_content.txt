and Ashley was there with me, and my Dad.I was following Leah and some Myrtle Beach people for a while untill my dad stopped us and Leah and Ashley and the rest walked off. Dad told me that he had to get back to the airport to catch his plane home, and I freaked and started yelling about what I was going to do about money? and blah blah blah.&amp;nbsp; After he left me, I was&amp;nbsp;frantically&amp;nbsp;trying to find a Bank of America (I know.. in India but that's what dad told me to do) and calling Ashley over and over again without any luck of getting in touch with her.&amp;nbsp; I didn't know the name of my hotel or how much it cost... and I was worried because Ashley was supposed to be staying with me and she obviously didn't know what was going on and I thought Leah was supposed to also but I couldn't contact her either. There were U.S. Military everywhere...I had my bookbag full of snacks and I thought about how that was a good thing since I couldn't find a damn BofA to get money from.&amp;nbsp; Then this random guy told me he would help me search for some people I knew so he took me around and we came to a crowded place to he asked me to hold his hand but it was difficult. He was like, forget it, but I was stubborn and afraid to get lost in the crowd so I held on even thought it was really uncomfortable for some reason.Then the Sloans, Meredith, Christi and Frank all came down and called my name and I wasn't holding that guy's hand but Thomas's and they were like, &amp;quot;Well...I guess you could sleep on the floor of our hotel room. But only for a little while&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; They don't like me very much so I wouldn't expect them to be welcoming to me in my dreams.But Meredith was very angry with me for some unknown reason so I left and went back into the streets of India. alone again. it was a terrifying feeling.that was my dream.
