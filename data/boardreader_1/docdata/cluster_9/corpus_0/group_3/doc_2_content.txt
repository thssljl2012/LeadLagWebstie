Lincoln Financial Field is the nicest stadium I&amp;#8217;ve traveled to so far.  The previous contender was Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, but this is much more impressive.  Not only is everything new, not only is the press box cafeteria stocked with local favorites (Tastykakes, pretzels, cannolis), but everything is labeled.  Directions to the press box, directions to the field, the various locker rooms &amp;#8212; even the Instant Replay Bike Rack is clearly and carefully marked.  I don&amp;#8217;t have any particular use for the Instant Replay Bike Rack, but the people who do should have no problem identifying it. I do have use for the press box, as that&amp;#8217;s where I&amp;#8217;m currently sitting, and it&amp;#8217;s nice to be able to locate it without too much wandering.
