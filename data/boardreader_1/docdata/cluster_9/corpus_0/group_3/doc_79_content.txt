 I noticed in my bank statement yesterday that two payments for 41.16 had been paid to Tesco on the same day. It doesn&amp;#8217;t take a rocket scientist to establish that something was wrong so I phoned my Bank, LLoyds TSB who swiftly washed their hands of it and pointed me in the direction of Tesco. Never mind, I thought, Tesco&amp;#8217;s legendary approach to customer service. Every Little Helping and all that will sort this out quicker than you can say &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not my fault.&amp;#8221; Nah. Call 1 To Tesco.com. &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s the store code on the statement?&amp;#8217; I was asked. I told them and they washed their hands of it. &amp;#8220;Not our problem sir, that&amp;#8217;s A Tesco Direct store code. Here&amp;#8217;s the number.&amp;#8221; Call 2 To Tesco Direct. &amp;#8220;Sorry Sir that&amp;#8217;s not our code. You&amp;#8217;ll need to call Tesco Stores.&amp;#8221; Call 3 To Tesc Stores. After the phone rang out for 20 minutes I hung up. Call 4 To Tesco Stores. Got through this time . Again refusal to acknowledge the store code and a grudging acceptance that they should establish exactly what store code 3538 eally is. After holding for 5 minutes as &amp;#8220;the computers are running slow and I have to search all our store codes in the UK&amp;#8221; I had to hang up as I was running late for a meeting. Call 5 Spoke to a nice guy in Wales who asked me &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s Occurin&amp;#8217;?&amp;#8221; (nah I made that bit up. He actually tried to resolve the issue and said he&amp;#8217;d call me back in 5 minutes. Call 6 Nice guy proclaimed triumphantly that he&amp;#8217;d sorted it. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s Tesco Wines!&amp;#8221; he exclaimed with glee. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve never used Tesco Wines.&amp;#8221; I told him. &amp;#8220;ah&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;..&amp;#8221; Well I&amp;#8217;ll put you through to Tesco Wine and they&amp;#8217;ll sort it for you. Call 7 After a 5 minute wait I was put through to Tesco Wine. &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t know what he&amp;#8217;s talkin&amp;#8217; about said Tesco Wines guy&amp;#8221; That isn&amp;#8217;t our code.
