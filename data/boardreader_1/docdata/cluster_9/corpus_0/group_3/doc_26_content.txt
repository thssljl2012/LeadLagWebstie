Amy Alkon Gives The Scoop On Bank Of America And Identity Theft On Mari Frank's Radio Show Today, 5-6 p.m., PST I'm on today, on 89.9 fm in Irvine, and streaming live on the Internet from KUCI.org. At the KUCI link, scroll down and look for the link to lawyer and identity theft expert Mari Frank's show, Privacy Piracy, in the 5-6 p.m. slot (that's Pacific Time), to hear the details on what I've discovered about Bank of America and their "security" measures in the wake of having my identity stolen.   If you are an identity theft victim, I recommend Mari's book, From Victim To Victor. She not only lays out everything you need to know, the book comes complete with a CD containing the text, written by a lawyer and identity theft expert (Mari), of all the letters you'll need to clean up what's left of your life and your financial life afterward.   Sorry to be a little lax in remembering to blog this -- I just turned in my book manuscript, minus the last chapter on Monday night (two months late, thanks to the months of hell I went through after B of A dispensed my money, seven times, to two thieves who basically presented used Kleenex for identification). In trying to get the book in, pretty much everything else has fallen by the wayside. But, Mari's terrific, and knows the topic like nobody else, and I recommend listening to this show and others she does.   Also, please, please, consider freezing your credit! It's the only reason my life, as I know it, isn't pretty much over.  Mari's site is here.
