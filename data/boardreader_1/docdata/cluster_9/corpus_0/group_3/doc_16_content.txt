Such an odd day I should say. Really.So I got pissed in the early morning as I couldn't transfer all my money in Hansa account to my Lloyds TSB bank account. Yeah, it kept saying that &amp;quot;the daily limit was used&amp;quot; or something. Whatever that, the money won't run away anyway, it's just will make it longer to get my laptop and I'm desperate getting it.Later, thought, was ok. I had Design For The Internet module which was neither boring or interesting. Once again I was reminded that I have to start thinking about my website and what it should be about. Well, I'm thinking about doing something like fansite. I hope I will come with idea soon enough.Earlier this evening I've got a call from some guy from charity, and he started talking about all the charity thing and I kept saying &amp;quot;yeas&amp;quot; to him which led to that I will have financially support that charity thing and... umm... the point is that I actually need a charity myself, I really really don't have any money to give away. I still wish to help tho. That guy is going to call me on 8pm today anyway, I'll explain everything to him, maybe ask for some volunteer job.And yeas, you may ask why this Tuesday is so odd even thought it sound like it. I just feel odd, and it happends pretty often actually. That's all to explain.Notes to myself: Remember to watch for that HOAX store in Moulsham, New London Rd for my brotherThink about website moreTransfer all the left money and check the process of those paymentsOh my god - work at 6pm as well!+Some cool guy's from Japan&amp;nbsp;art: http://rapeme.org/
