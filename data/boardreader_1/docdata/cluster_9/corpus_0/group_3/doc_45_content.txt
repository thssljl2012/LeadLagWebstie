I have downloaded some new anime titles and still going through them to see which I like, I'll have more later.Today I received in the mail two suite tickets, compliments of Coca-Cola, for the Bank of America 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway this weekend.  I have not decided who to take with me, but would need to know who's ready at short notice to watch NASCAR.  No parking pass though, so would need help with parking.Today's Fortune:  "You will soon be crossing desert sands for a fun vacation."Maybe my fortune is telling me to go to L.A. for the Final Fantasy Fanfest.
