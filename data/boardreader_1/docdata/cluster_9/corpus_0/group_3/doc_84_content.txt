For those of you who haven't been to Monroe but&amp;nbsp;at the end of town runs the Skycomish river. Next to the river about 100 ft away is Bank of America. Well yesterday a while an armed truck was dropping off money at the bank a man walked up to the truck and strayed the guard with a pepper spray. He then grabbed a bag of money with $50,000 in it and ran towards the river. He then got onto an inflatable rubber tube and floated down the river where he was later picked up by a getaway car down the river. What is so smart about this plan was the police have no way of tracking the guy. They have no idea what the get away car looks like or what the guy looks like. The river goes for miles and the guy could have been picked up anywhere. There is no way for the police to go to each river boat lauch looking for the guy. So he got away with it. This is the greatest thing I have ever heard, the guy was accutaly smart and figured out a way that the police couldn't find him.
