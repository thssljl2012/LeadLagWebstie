Whew!&amp;nbsp; It's been a whole month since my last blog -- not counting the hastily-written entry of 9/26 -- it's been a whole month since my last real blog.&amp;nbsp; That blog told the story of a lovely walk in the woods.&amp;nbsp; Since then, we've walked -- and driven -- "mony a weary mile."&amp;nbsp; It's been a great month, albeit a hectic, exhausting one!&amp;nbsp; Now it's time to rest, and to get back to writing, which I dearly enjoy.  So what's been happening?&amp;nbsp; Well, there was the Yellow Daisy Festival.&amp;nbsp; It seems so long ago that I don't even have many specific memories to tell you about!&amp;nbsp; Of course, we loved seeing the folks that we've become accustomed to seeing at that show; to us, they're almost like family members who live some distance away and you see them but rarely, so that each visit is greatly cherished.&amp;nbsp; Talking about friends whom you just don't see enough -- our camp-mates from the Florida Folk Festival, Cecilia and Whitey, made their first trip to Yellow Daisy.&amp;nbsp; It's been a little over two years since we last saw them.&amp;nbsp; We enjoyed their visit to our Stone Mountain campsite; Maggie particularly liked their company.&amp;nbsp; Though Whitey went back home to Florida, Cecilia worked the festival in a promotional booth -- she ran her legs off -- at least Greg and I can mostly sit during our days there -- have you recovered yet, Cec?  The Monday-Tuesday after the close of Yellow Daisy are always a challenge for Greg, who does almost all of the driving, and this year was no exception.&amp;nbsp; This year, the challenge began shortly after leaving Stone Mountain: we got off to a great, early start only to discover that it is actually possible to start your trip too early, especially if you're in need of diesel.&amp;nbsp; We lost almost an hour&amp;nbsp; driving around an Atlanta neighborhood in search of an open convenience store that sold diesel fuel.&amp;nbsp; And then when we found a store that promised 24-hour pump access, we had problems with our credit card -- the time of day, combined with our attempt to use the card in a high crime area, sent up a red flag to ever-vigilant Bank Of America.&amp;nbsp; Who knew that credit cards thieves use the card readers at gas stations to determine whether or not a stolen card is going to be easy to access?&amp;nbsp; I know -- now.&amp;nbsp; It's funny -- now.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't too hilarious at the time.&amp;nbsp; In all, we lost about an hour of driving time, still managing to escape Metro Atlanta before the morning rush hour, but pretty effectively nullifying our early start.&amp;nbsp; That frustration aside, the rest of the mad dash up to New England was pretty uneventful.  And then we began setting up our Big E display.&amp;nbsp; This year we doubled our booth space and the new set-up required a little more care and thought.&amp;nbsp; At left is the finished product, and we were quite pleased with the looks -- and with the extra space!&amp;nbsp; You may be able to see that, in addition to my CDs (displayed on the tables) we offered fun Celtic tapestries, made-in-New-Hampshire Celtic t-shirts ... and those round things toward the top of the booth are Michael Vignoles's bodhrans, made in Galway, Ireland.  Some of the funnier things that happened at The Big E involved Maggie Muggins.&amp;nbsp; We discovered, before the fair had even started, that she is a little afraid of cows.&amp;nbsp; She seemed awed by the sheer size of them, and avoided eye contact; that is, until one sulky cow "mooed" at her.&amp;nbsp; I don't speak cow, so I am not altogether sure, but I think the cow was telling Maggie, "I don't like you!"&amp;nbsp; I have come to understand chow-chow over the years, though, and I am positive that when Maggie began barking and straining at the end of her leash, she was telling that cow, in no uncertain terms, "Well I don't care much for you either!"  Whether it was the size of the cows, or something else about them, that initially intimidated Maggie, I'll never know.&amp;nbsp; But she absolutely adored the Budweiser Clydesdales, quartered very close to our campsite, which are of course even bigger than cows.&amp;nbsp; Her little body just went electric every time she caught sight of them.&amp;nbsp; I'll admit to being electrified, myself, at the sight of those majestic giants as they were led around the deserted fairgrounds on their early morning walkies.&amp;nbsp; The baby elephant seemed intriguing to Maggie ... the gigantic momma elephant was given all due respect.&amp;nbsp; There was no barking within earshot of the elephants; I'd have to guess that Maggie's survival instinct told her to keep really, really quiet in order to stay under the elephants' radar!  Jerry Lane, affectionately known as "Uncle Jerry" to friends at home, our band, and now half of West Springfield, Massachusetts, made an appearance the last weekend of the fair.&amp;nbsp; What a joy it was to have him there!&amp;nbsp; He was a big help to us, especially during the break-down after the end of the fair, which we accomplished in record time despite the fact that our set-up was larger and more complex than ever before.&amp;nbsp; We had a couple of relaxing post-fair days: a campfire on Monday night (after leaving the fairgrounds for a campground in Southwick) and a nice dinner out with our friends Melissa and John on Tuesday night.&amp;nbsp; And today we put Uncle Jerry on a plane bound back to Florida; we miss him already.
