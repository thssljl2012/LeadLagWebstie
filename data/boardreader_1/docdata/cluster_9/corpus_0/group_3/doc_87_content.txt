wednesday already! can u guys believe it? surely there must be a way to prevent time from passing before i am ready for the hsc. its killing my life. the constant worrying, trying to lived up to my parent&amp;#8217;s expectation, trying to think of what i&amp;#8217;m gonna do if i dont get into uni after all and yeah&amp;#8230;. thinking and the thinking and the thinking that kept overflowing my head that soon it felt like its gonna explode! ahhh. suppose to go out today with friends but didnt get pay yet due to the monday public holiday. so one day late of payment. stupid transaction st george. i seriously need to change bank.i want to get out of the house tommorw. dont think i can stay home due to the constant headache and the boredom! i am starting to wonder that due to my lacking and motivation to study will seriously affect my results? i mean, i did pretty well for my trials and stuff (except for maths) with little study and preparation so i will wonder if i will actually get a decent mark even tho im not like those nerds time, who constantly study with no social life. i dont know. life is just so weird. im starting to take an interest in anime now. yeah, what happen to the reading? well lets just say im taking a break from reading for a bit since everytime i read i get sooooo bored. maybe its the same plot over over and over again. of course i still love books! i seriously cannot live without it but maybe for now i just need to take a break from it and start watching anime! so where can i buy it? tried ebay and stuff but they are so limited! need to go anime hunting. work tomorrow again! 5pm till 10pm then friday at 6am to 2pm. that is all.
