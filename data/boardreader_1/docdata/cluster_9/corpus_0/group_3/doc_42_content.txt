       nothing says happiness like a trip to the happiest place on earth!it was purely a coincidence that the day after olivia lost her friend, her grandma surprised her with a trip to disneyland that had long been in the works!&amp;#0160; i love their expressions her when i dropped them off at the airport:&amp;#0160; pure, unadulterated JOY!  also, i want to make note of the obituary posted yesterday in our local paper, the Tacoma News Tribune:&amp;#0160; Mercedesthere is a memorial fund set up for her, and in lieu of flowers (and if you feel so inclined), you have the opportunity to donate in her memory.&amp;#0160; many of you have emailed me your sweet condolences and kind thoughts, and i thank you --we both thank you!-- from the bottom of our hearts.&amp;#0160; several of you have been touched by asthma in some way or another.&amp;#0160; it is ironic that olivia herself had a couple close scares with asthma as an infant, as did baylor. &amp;#0160; any donations received will go towards pediatric asthma research and additional funeral costs:ask for the:Mercedes B. Mears Memorial Fund atBank of America (any branch)we will be going to the viewing tomorrow, and then to the celebration of her life on wednesday.&amp;#0160; (information included in the obituary).
