JESUS CHRIST. I still haven't applied. Need to get some respectable people to look at my personal statement. McArdle said it was &amp;quot;very interesting&amp;quot; and didn't change it, even though it's my first draft. Maybe I should just SEND&amp;nbsp;it. Cba. People's lives should revolve around me because otherwise they're not at my beck and call when I need them and I won't get things done myself.I'm meant to be working but instead I'm reading my friends page. I wish there were three biological/chemical sciences. Then I could take them. I would never cope with physics, not after to years of maths-filled astronomy. I couldn't have kept maths this year and got a half-decent grade. I don't want to do the French speaking mock next week, not when I haven't even written the answers yet, let alone learned them. I can't believe I ended up putting in to resit AS speaking in JANUARY for crying out loud. At least it'll be out of the way. But I have seven exams in January. Maybe I should un-give up chocolate over Christmas to get me through all the revision.And I still have to write the French language essay. And read chapter six of the book for the literature coursework. And do my sodding chemistry coursework. And finish all my homework. &amp;nbsp;And revise for the polymers test I have on Monday. And just DO. DO, DO, DO. Too much to do.But don't for a second let that give you the impression that I will be forfeiting Silent Witness tonight (and tomorrow night). Of course not. I need my weekly fix of Harry, Nicky, Leo and chilling murder cases.Best get some more French done and find some horrible regretful foodstuff with which to depress myself before time ticks round to nine of the clock, post meridian. That means I have precisely seven six minutes (if television schedules are to be trusted).
