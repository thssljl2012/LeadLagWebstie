managed to get the tire changed.&amp;nbsp; I'm now driving around on a doughnut.&amp;nbsp; it leaves this sticky residue on the road.&amp;nbsp; I think other motorists would complain if it wasn't so sugary sweet and filled with krispy kreme goodness.&amp;nbsp; :P&amp;nbsp; any who.&amp;nbsp; still looking for a job.&amp;nbsp; probably going to see if food lion is highering overnight stockers.&amp;nbsp; i dont want a night job, but i need money.&amp;nbsp; ill probably limit my hours to 2 or 3 days a week for now.&amp;nbsp; i think that will make it easier to look for another, better job, and take off some of the stress of not having money coming in.&amp;nbsp; on another note, I found the gamers in this town, or at least where they hang out and play.&amp;nbsp; Little shop called mind games, hidden back behind Bank of America.&amp;nbsp; one of the people who works there is starting a dnd 4.0 game on sunday.&amp;nbsp; I might go and see whats up with that.&amp;nbsp; I'm not familiar with 4.0, but hey, its gaming and I can always learn.&amp;nbsp;
