I do, and I think it's money well spent. Here's another photo which shows the color of the jacket better, and also shows her healing the dowdy:Just after the photograph was taken, that woman's wrist scrunchy evaporated in a sparkley poof of glitter and Chanel #5. And remember, though I've been lax about this lately, NO MEAN COMMENTS ABOUT CINDY.
