Last night, I had the opportunity to attend the Nationwide Series - Dollar General 300 at Lowes Motor Speedway. Kyle Busch took the checkered flag. He has won twenty races this year NASCAR's , Sprint Cup, Nationwide and Trucks. Busch has won 8 Sprint Cup series races this year. He has another chance tonight at the Bank of America 500 to increase this total.It was a night of rain, caution flags and a few wrecks with the race ending a little after midnight.  The fans were enthusiastic and the drivers all seemed to be having a great time even with the delays.Even with the gas crisis the infield at Lowes was full of spectators in their RV's and modified buses. This race gave me the opportunity to see the sport close up from the pit areas. The pits are a lot like going to war, you prepare and plan, you wait around and then their are about 20 seconds of adrenaline rush as the pit crews jump from the wall holding tires, large gas cans, and electric wrenches/drills.During the race, there were some wrecks on the track in front of the pit area/near the start finish line. They towed the cars off the tracks into the garages. You could smell the fumes from the gas as they drove past.Looking forward to tonight's race and learning more about being first person in the pits.  ...
