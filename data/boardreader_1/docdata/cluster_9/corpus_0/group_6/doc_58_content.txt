  Silverlake Art/Craft &amp; Vintage Fairlocated in: CITIBANK PARKING LOT: 2450 GLENDALE BLVD. LA CA 90039 Sheyne and I got together Sunday morning to go check out the Silverlake Fair, a flea market out in the parking lot next to Citibank.  It was a pretty tiny venue but walkable and with a relaxed air, not too many people visiting at 10 in the morning.  Most of it was old thriftstore flea market type stuff with some handicraft booths here and there.  Out of all the various artist handicraft booths there were two that I was really impressed with and one clothing booth with very nice/cheap duds that I ended up buying a shirt from...  Best booth in the entire lot was this one, from KikiUnfortunately, I have lost my business card from her and completely cannot remember any other contact infoKiki and her booth mate, who was selling really cute and interesting reclaimed and recycled crafted plant arrangementsI regret not getting photos of her stuff, but I do have her card: Velvet Spade Designshttp://www.velvetspadedesigns.comBeautiful BEAUTIFUL jewelryAn inventive take on the tired wrapped-pearl concept you've all seen beforeThis time with pre-knit wire, encasing flat pebbles for added texture, as well as bunched organdy and chiffon petals along the neckline.  So stunning!Sliced gemstones give a bit of raw edge to this delicate necklaceI want all of this stuffTyler Bender Book Cowww.tylerbender.etsy.comThe other cool booth was this wee table set up by a guy named Tyler, who makes all his own handmade recycled books, from old vintage volumes and reclaimed paper.  For a recycled object this is a very finished and great looking product.  I really, really wanted to grab the "Hong Kong" titled book, but I was short of funds.  oops no rotate.I wonder who will eventually buy this little Hong Kong oneAfterwards we headed to the Melrose Trading Post, where we had other amazing adventures.  But for another post
