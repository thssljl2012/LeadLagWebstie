 I took this photo Tuesday night leaving work. It was almost dark out and the snow was coming down fairly thick like. I hung on to this guy's ass for a while since traffic was very heavy and I wanted to make sure he was safe and force all the cars to the left lane. Plus I saw a photo op.This was North Cliff Avenue which is very busy after work. He did have a helmet but it was dangling around his handle bars. He did not have any lights fore or aft. Coming back from lunch today there was a commuter on the side walk of 4th Avenue (Citibank area), and I noticed he also had the helmet dangling problem.In case you are not into Twitter I will parrot Tez's Tweet. "You can't fix stupid."
