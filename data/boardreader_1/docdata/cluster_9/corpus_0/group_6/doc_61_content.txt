GCAA Basketball Intramurals completed exciting week 7 as First Graders start playing mini-games.       GCAA Intramurals Games, sponsored by Citibank, and the K-1 GCAA clinics, sponsored by Lane Furniture are in full swing. Many intramural contests once again came down to the wire this past weekend while some of our K-1 players continued playing mini games.
