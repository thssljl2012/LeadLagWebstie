The NHL Players Association 30 member executive boardvoted unanimously today not to reopen the collective bargaining agreementwith the league. Although the terms of the CBA allow the players to open it up for renegotiation by May 18th of this year, the players have notified the league of no intention to do so. Many players have commented that the national economy is in too bad a place for them to start renegotiating their CBA. Another thing I love about hockey. Maturity (Ruutu excluded).  That means Hockey is safe again from the dreaded lock-out (not from skyrocketing salaries and low revenues, but a lock-out) until September of 2011. Sleep tight, everybody.  -PinkJerseysSuck
