         Around this time of the year, in the middle of sizzling summer, Australia is abuzz with premier sport tournaments. Starting with the Boxing Day Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, the Commonwealth Bank Series: Australia vs South Africa Cricket and of course, the smorgasbord of tennis tournaments - Hopman Cup (Perth), Medibank International (Sydney), AAMI Kooyong Classic (Melbourne), Brisbane International and highlighted by the Australian Open in Melbourne which is the first of the four grand slam tournaments in world tennis.Adelaide will not miss out on these premier sporting events. Last week saw the first World Tennis Challenge (14-16 January 2009) at the War Memorial Drive. This week, however, is perhaps one of the biggest events - the first pro-cycling race of the year, the 800km Tour Down Under. This year's tour is made much more special because of Lance Armstrong's participation as his comeback race. The cycling tournament kickstart the week-long event today with the 51km Cancer Council Classic Race at Rymill Park right in the heart of the city. Armstrong maintains that he will not win his first race after over three years of hiatus but I'm sure with race fever gripping Adelaide, he will be a sight to see. I hope to watch Stage 6 (Adelaide City Council Circuit) of the race on the final day of the tour - hopefully catch a glimpse of the bike with number 1274 and perhaps photos of the amazing sportsman, his team - Astana and all the other Australian and International riders in action.Last but not the least and capping this exciting week will be the Cricket Test: Australia vs South Africa on Australia Day, 26 January.Labels: Adelaide, Australia, Digressions, Ramblings
