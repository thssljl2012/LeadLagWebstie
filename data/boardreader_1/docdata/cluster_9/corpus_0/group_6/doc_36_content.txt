A new guy came out to fix the furnace. The fuel pump was loose. There may or may not also be a problem with the ignition (well, DUH, since the furnace won't turn on automatically when the house is cold--won't turn on at all except manually--I'd say there's a problem with the ignition!).So far that's four parts that have had to be repaired--the motor, two burner couplings, and now the fuel pump. Sigh.The radiators are warm and there is hot water for now. I still feel cold, though. That strikes me as unfair.***In other news, I got a reply from Steeple Hill Press. They sound sympathetic, in a way--as if they don't care for the restrictions on their historicals but can't say so.Many thanks for your very articulate and well argued email, which Katherine Orr passed on to me. Please understand that the Steeple Guidelines are based on what is acceptable or unacceptable to the Christian Booksellers Association, which is very conservative. They are the "gatekeepers," and if they refuse to stock a book because they find it offensive, their customers will not have a chance to buy the book from them. We want to sell the maximum number of books; therefore we respect the CBA guidelines, whether we personally agree with them or not.That said, the CBA isn't necessarily consistent with itself, and will be flexible about some of these things with bestselling authors like Catherine Palmer, whom many of the booksellers know personally, whereas a new author may have fewer options if her book is to be ordered by the CBA stores. Hope this helps to clarify the situation. Thank you again for writing, and we hope you will continue to enjoy Steeple Hill books. Blessings,XXXX***I just love the fact that the Christian Booksellers Association can find ACTUAL HISTORY offensive to their beliefs. Now I wonder which bookstores are members?
