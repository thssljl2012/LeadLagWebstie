 To add to the Premier Bank saga with Taylor (see this link), we found out that Bank of America dissolved Premier Bank.  Not everyone was let go, but many were demoted.I have no other words but to say that our Heavenly Father knows much more than we do.   We thought this job was the answer to our financial situation.  Boy, were we wrong.
