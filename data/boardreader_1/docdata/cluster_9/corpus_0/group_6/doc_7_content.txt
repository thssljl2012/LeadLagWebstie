I had truly gotten spoiled having two weeks with only two workdays (because of the holidays, I got the days before and after Christmas and New Years Day off).&amp;nbsp; Going back to my usual four-and-a-half day schedule nearly undid me.But, I made it.&amp;nbsp; Today being payday made it sweeter.Nick took the bus down and met me after I got off work, so we went down to Lancaster (where Bank of America resides) to deposit my check.&amp;nbsp; We then stopped at the Lancaster library to turn in a book and pick up several others; I had ordered a copy of Starship Troopers for Nick. On a random search, I found Cyborg by Martin Caidin, the novel which formed the basis for the 70's TV show The Six Million Dollar Man.  This ought to be an interesting read... After a quick lunch, we then drove to GameStop in Palmdale, right near the Wal-Mart Nick used to work at.&amp;nbsp; There are quite a number of new stores and shops built near there since the last time we drove by (including a Sonic!&amp;nbsp; Grrrr.  Had I know that, I wouldn't have settled for Pizza Hut.)  He exchanged a couple of games that we had gotten from my lawyer-boss for ones that we did not already have; I stopped in Wal-Mart to buy some new earphones (we go through them like nobody's business).After that, we went to Vallarta's, the grocery store that caters more to the Hispanic community.&amp;nbsp; They did have some great specials this week...&amp;nbsp; I somehow managed to forget the rice &amp;amp; bean package that we prominently featured in their ad, and that Maribeth put at the top of the list.&amp;nbsp; Oh well.Blogged with the Flock Browser
