                   A commercial I shot late last year started airing in American markets recently and thought I'd share some candids.  The advert is a series of vignettes showing employees reaching out and helping customers.  I suited up for the role of "Dad with child" and had the pleasure of hanging out with Bruno, Yosuke and their lovely parents.  Effortless work when your co-stars are so darned adorable!
