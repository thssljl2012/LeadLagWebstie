Every day, I make sure to do a little something that is just for me. It keeps me healthy. Today, it was replacing my check card. Bank of America allows you to select from a bunch of different cards, mostly sports and charities. Wanting to find the best and/or most ludicrous option, I decided to go for this:As I was navigating their website to find the number to make the change, I run into their advert for their service...I couldn't help but notice that they have an Asian woman with a gift bag/pink turtleneck to represent Hello Kitty and a white dude with folded arms/muscles and a crappy Nascar shirt for Nascar. Not to mention the pink and blue arrows to make sure you know that these are the best checking account options for these individuals.
