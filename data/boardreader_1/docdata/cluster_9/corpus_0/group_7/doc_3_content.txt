             I am really glad that on thursday I am able to get a buddy of mine to his fifth and final athletic event you could possibly seein the city of Seattle. In the last two years I have gotten him to his first game at Qwest, KeyArena, Safeco Field and Husky Stadium(in 20 years), so Bank of America Arena is next. It has molded him into a huge sports fan and I am glad I am responsible for that.
