For the single people, today is BLACK FRIDAY!  So Happy Black Friday to all of us spending the holiday working.  As for Saturday and Valentine's Day - happy Singles Day for those of us spending it alone:(  And happy Friday the 13th - watch out for people in hockey masks.Price of stamps going up again?  Seriously???  There isn't enough junk mail floating around from Citibank or MBNA to keep them in business?  They should up the postage rate for BULK mail, we'd all benefit from that.  So it is even more rediculous to consider that I can mail a card from Taiwan to the US for about 70 cents but it is costing well over 40 cents to mail that bill from your house to the other side of town.  Who uses the postal service anymore?I'm doing pretty well on my goal of watching all the academy award nominee movies before the award's ceremony.  I'm about half way and I have to say the movies are pretty good.  Expect a full summary next week.It was in the upper 80s today here in Taipei - and very blue skies!  So warm in fact that I had to turn on the Air Conditioning last night to sleep, and it's on now.  Should be back in the 70s for the weekend so hopefully some good exploration weather.Have a good weekend!
