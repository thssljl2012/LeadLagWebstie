I&#8217;m opposed to torture for ethical reasons.  I&#8217;m opposed to torture, period.  If it works, I&#8217;m still opposed to torture.  If torture&#8217;s the only way we can get certain information, if forswearing torture leaves us materially less able to get the intelligence we need to defend ourselves against terrorism, I still think that we should confine ourselves to (hypothetically) less useful interrogation methods.  There are some things you don&#8217;t get to do to win an advantage.  There have to be some moral boundaries, yes, even in the face of Al Qaeda.  Steve Chapman at Reason puts it well.  And if effectiveness is the only gauge, why even debate whether these techniques fit the definition of torture? The problem with using &#8220;it worked&#8221; as an argument is that it justifies too much. By that rationale, we can justify subjecting enemy captives to every form of torture ever devised. We can even justify torturing and killing their spouses, siblings, parents, and children, right in front of them. Cheney and others have yet to advocate going that far. But if they really believe what they say about the techniques we&#8217;ve used, here&#8217;s a question they need to answer: Why not?  So, I&#8217;m willing to go out on a limb and say that waterboarding a guy 183 times really is torture, and that it really should be forbidden, even in the unlikely event that Cheney et al manage to produce evidence that such waterboarding really is a more useful intelligence gathering method than traditional interrogation.  I&#8217;m with Chapman, here.  To me, &#8220;Does torture work&#8221; isn&#8217;t the key question. At the same time, if torture is both wrong and far from the magic terrorism fighting bullet that its proponents make it out to be, I see nothing wrong with making both points.  After all, multiple professional interrogators have made the case that non-torture methods are a better means of safeguarding our security than torture. The reason I take the trouble to say this, now, though the &#8220;torture doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; argument is more Steve S.&#8217;s domain than mine is that Jonah Goldberg, at the National Review&#8217;s Corner blog, has made what looks to me to be a very weak case against the &#8220;torture doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; argument (to be distinguished from Megan McArdle&#8217;s more sensible cautions about the limitations of such arguments), and Jim Manzi, at the same blog, has made a much stronger counter-argument. Let&#8217;s here from Goldberg first.  The point of these interrogations isn&#8217;t to get &#8220;false confessions&#8221; or confessions of any kind. It&#8217;s to get intelligence you can check against other intelligence. Yglesias is surely right that those interrogated say many false things, but they say true things too, which can be verified. This is a point Mukasey, Hayden and others have made many times now and yet the opponents of these interrogation methods seem determined to ignore it. Again, I have no objection to the moral argument against torture  if you honestly believe something amounts to torture. But the &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; line remains a cop out, no matter how confidently you bluster otherwise.  This dismissal of the &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; line as &#8220;a cop out&#8221; is bullshit, no matter how confidently Goldberg may bluster otherwise.  What Goldberg overlooks here are the following points: First, &#8220;torture doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; as an argument, doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;nobody could ever possibly get a true scrap of information out of a suspect by torture.&#8221;  Heck, playing the lottery sometimes &#8220;works&#8221;; frankly, I&#8217;d be really surprised if successfully ferretting the truth from the lies (and the sheer sleeplessness-induced mental confusion) of a captive is as rare a thing as winning a million dollars or more in the lottery.  &#8220;Torture doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; in the tactical sense (Manzi has a different, strategic argument that I&#8217;ll get to later) means that torture works less well than traditional, non-torture, more psychological interrogation methods. Second, yes, sure, your interrogators could attempt to verify the things said under torture, and they might succeed in sifting the true things from the false.  But saying that they could do that isn&#8217;t, in itself, sufficient to show that, even if they do put in that effort, torture works better at getting intelligence than other methods.  It simply shifts the nature of the effort you&#8217;re asking of your interrogators.  Instead of taking the time, and using the psychology, to get a prisoner to actually give largely true information, they need to spend time verifying what&#8217;s true after the prisoner has been broken and spilled information which (since we know that people have confessed under torture to being witches and implicated whole covens along with themselves) naturally won&#8217;t be high quality to start with.  Why should we take torture advocates&#8217; word that sorting through all the bad information is the task that will more readily get us good intelligence?  Particularly when these same people said first that we don&#8217;t torture (but we know now that we did), and second that waterboarding broke people instantly (but we now know that one person was waterboarded 183 times). Third, Goldberg is ignoring human psychology; that, when attempting to judge whether someone is really giving us the right information, people don&#8217;t naturally just calmly use the most rational verification techniques available.  Even police using ordinary psychological interrogation methods don&#8217;t, always (despite the fact that, yes, they&#8217;ve been trained).  And if even if the interrogators on the spot are able to figure out when a prisoner&#8217;s already cooperating, their bosses may not.  To say that torture works because it&#8217;s possible to, at least sometimes, do outside verification of intelligence offered under torture is to say that we should trust that nobody would be convinced that a person&#8217;s guilty who isn&#8217;t, or that weapons of mass destruction are present that aren&#8217;t, or (to use an example from outside the war on terror) that a 13-year-old girl has &#8220;crotched&#8221; some ibuprofen when she&#8217;s actually been falsely accused by a snitch.  None of us trusted Lyndie England that far, but for some unknown reason we&#8217;re supposed to trust Jay Bybee and those acting at his behest ever so much more.  &#8220;Torture works,&#8221; to my mind, has a heavy &#8220;trust me, really&#8221; element to it. In another post, Jonah Goldberg draws a comparison with the death penalty.  I thought this comment from a reader was interesting: That&#8217;s pretty much the same as the argument that the death penalty doesn&#8217;t deter, which is also a cop-out. I don&#8217;t mean to pick on the reader, but I think this is exactly wrong  but in interesting ways. I agree that deterrence is often a red herring in debates about the death penalty. Either the death penalty is justified in a particular instance  or it isn&#8217;t. The death penlty cannot be justified by the deterrence argument. But the key difference is that the death penalty is punishment, administered only after due process. A government policy of torture is not justifiable as punishment. Or if it is (which is not my position), that argument has nothing to do with the torture debate under way right now. And if it were a legitimate form of punishment, it could only be administered after guilt was established via due process. That is pretty much the opposite of the case with enemy combatants.  Here I actually somewhat agree with Goldberg; the &#8220;is death penalty a deterrent&#8221; argument is a red herring in the sense that the deterrence can&#8217;t justify the death penalty unless it&#8217;s a legitimate punishment to begin with.  But I find the reader&#8217;s analogy interesting for another reason. Does violence work?  Does killing work?  I think even a Quaker, like myself, has to say yes.  True, people may often overestimate the degree to which violence &#8220;works&#8221; in a given situation, because of our natural desire for revenge.  True, violence may often &#8220;work&#8221; best for achieving ends that aren&#8217;t legitimate to begin with.  But, whatever we make of our peace testimony, and whatever we think it constrains us from doing in the way of using force, I find it hard to see how we can seriously make the case that &#8220;We utterly deny all outward wars and strife and fightings with outward weapons, for any end or under any pretence whatsoever. And this is our testimony to the whole world&#8221; because &#8220;fightings with outward weapons&#8221; simply don&#8217;t work.  Fighting with outward weapons sometimes works just fine at protecting your home and family from other people who are coming at you with outward weapons.  And, unlike the dubious &#8220;torture to stop a ticking time bomb&#8221; scenario, the &#8220;what if someone was coming after your helpless grandmother&#8221; question that gets thrown at pacifist isn&#8217;t something that has never happened. Because violence is neither a thing that is inherently doomed always to fail, nor a thing that&#8217;s inherently the absolute best tool for the job, far more effective than the nonviolent means at your disposal, there&#8217;s no reason to assume that &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; arguments will all work the same way.  And, in this case, the death penalty argument and the torture argument don&#8217;t work the same way. The reason the death penalty isn&#8217;t, under current circumstances, a significant deterrent is that, a) if you don&#8217;t use the death penalty, you&#8217;re still going to be throwing those same people in prison for life, and b) the death penalty, as currently applied, amounts to putting just some murderers on de...
