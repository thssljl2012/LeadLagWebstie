Just got the news about Ted Dekker's latest novel!No HARDCOVER fiction title from an established CBA author has ever landed in the TOP TEN of the New York Times Bestsellers list outside the Left Behind phenomenon, not even close that we can find. And definitely not an author of Thrillers.Until now.The Team at Circle Media and Creative Trust would like to congratulate Ted for news just received that BoneMan's Daughters will debut at #10 on the NYT Bestseller's list (May 3rd.)...What's even more amazing about hitting #10 is that most Christian bookstores (which are very good to Ted) don't even report their sales to bookscan-if they did the book would likely be much higher on the list.-From Ted Dekker's listserv
