Ok so its been a minute since I updated but a lot of craziness has been going on. From a month of everyone being broke and no one hiring, I got like 9 jobs dropped on me this week. Extra money for x-mas is always good though. I still manage to take a picture or so in between. So yeah. Remember cheap things, well most things on my wish list will get you a spot in the studio, so give until it hurts! The Dark Knight comes out on DVD tonight and I will be buying it. And I got tickets to the sold out game last night against Tampa Bay. I wish I had pictures but the NFL isn't cool with bringing in a huge DSLR camera to the game... : / Regardless I have never felt 73,000 people go so insane. I have been to games before but I have never felt Bank of America Stadium shake. It was a little scary at times feeling this huge concrete and steel structure move. The atmosphere was electric, and out of 73,000 fans we had the one loud obnoxious Tampa Bay fan right behind us the whole game. Well until the 4th quarter when we broke our foot off in Tampa's ass.
