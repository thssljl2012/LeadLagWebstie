WHICH MEANS I AM GETTING A $600 BILL FROM THEM RIGHT NOW and i sajfkalkfjklas don't want to talk it out with customer service on either end ughhhhhall i want to do is have a full day offstay in all dayleave my pj's onand make christmas cards. haha i am such a whiner omg, all this stuff is so shallow and unimportant, there are people outside right now in ten-degree weather who don't have a bed to sleep in, can someone remind me to shut the fuck up already?WAH WAH
