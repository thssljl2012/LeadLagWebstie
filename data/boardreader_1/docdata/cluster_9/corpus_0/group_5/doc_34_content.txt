I&amp;#8217;m not sure where Ole Miss&amp;#8217; head hoops coach ranks on a list of the state of Mississippi&amp;#8217;s highest paid educators, but it might not be a stretch to assume he&amp;#8217;ll be earning far less in the future, as the Cincinnati Enquirer&amp;#8217;s Sharon Coolidge explains.  Former University of Cincinnati head basketball coach Andy Kennedy, now head coach at Mississippi, was arrested this morning on a charge of assault, accused of attacking a taxi driver and hurling racial slurs at the man, according to police and court records. Also arrested was William Armstrong, the director of operations at Mississippi, on a charge of disorderly conduct, reports show. The men are in town for the SEC/Big East invitational at U.S. Bank Arena. Mississippi plays No. 8 Louisville tonight. Reports state Armstrong, 31, was drunk and thrown out of the Lodge Bar downtown early this morning. After that, he and Kennedy got a cab. A report says Armstrong taunted the driver in which his conduct was likely to cause a violent response. A separate report says Kennedy was the aggressor and punched the driver, Mohammed Ould Jiddou. During the attack Kennedy used racial slurs. Police say a person standing nearby witnessed the assault and that Armstrong was so intoxicated he refused to calm down when asked and requested that he be taken to jail.
