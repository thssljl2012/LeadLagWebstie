NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- It&amp;#039;s final: Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather isn&amp;#039;t going to work for Wachovia. Wachovia in September handed its marketing account to a WPP Group team led by Ogilvy after a lengthy pitch. But the celebration was short-lived: Just days after the win came news that the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank would merge Citibank. That merger was later scrapped in favor of a marriage with Wells Fargo, but Wachovia in the interim &amp;quot;paused the finalization&amp;quot; of its contract with Ogilvy. What&amp;#039;s finally transpired, though, is that the shop has been bypassed in favor of Omnicom Group&amp;#039;s DDB, executives familiar with the matter said.
