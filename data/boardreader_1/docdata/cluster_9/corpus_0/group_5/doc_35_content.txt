#498 - Plot Divisive  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;   New episodes Monday, Wednesday and FridayFriday, December 19, 2008TODAY'S NEWS:  What should you have on your calendar for January 3rd?  That's right, the Fan Appreciation Event (Portland, Oregon, Portland Central Library, US Bank Room, from 10:30 - noon)!  Be there to meet other Fans and get Non-Virtual Doughnuts and Ice Cream!  There will be Prizes!  See you then! So begins the Holiday Hiatus.  If you're not subscribed to the RSS feed or the LJ accounts for the comic, you might want to check in on the comic a time or two during the next couple weeks.  I'm not promising that there will be Bonus Comics, I'm just saying there might.  And while you're here, you can fling a vote or two for Ask Dr. Eldritch, to keep us from sinking to obscurity in the ranking sites.  Thanks, Everyone, for reading my comic this year!  I have high hopes that next year will be even bigger, better, and MORE XTREME!! Happy Holidays, and see you in 2009!Click here to read the comments or post one of your own at the LiveJournal Ask Dr. Eldritch blog (No registration required)!Click here to read the comments or post one of your own at the Eldritch Realm LiveJournal Community (Register to post)!
