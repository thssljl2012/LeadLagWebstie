Cruising the blogs, I found this superbly telling photo posted on the Shiela Edelman blog, without comment. Its enjoyable in so many ways, Ill do the commenting while saying thank you to Edelman in Pittsburgh.The grate adaptation goes beyond an imaginative sales message or creative medium (though the street ad for Vijay Sales encompasses both of these). To me, it drives home an understanding that Indian consumer marketing is moving upits already come a long way but its roots are in the street  with the people.Theres some portion of Indian society that will recognize and appreciate the wry humor behind Need a New Barbecue? Thanks to Google, though, we can find out even more. Vijay Sales is (apparently) a very large chain in India, principally known for electronics and appliance sales. It has a large-scale presence on the Internet in terms of mobile phones and other CE goodies.The telephone number shown in the photo is for Vijay Sales #384, in Prabhadevi, Mumbai; near Citibank, says the Yellow Pages. And one additional virtue of the Worldwide Web is the customer reviews: This particular Vijay store gets hammered on customer service. For example:Cash counter guy not able to give me a receipt, saying that the computers are down, they cant generate bill. Further, he tells me that credit card slip is sufficient. I DEMAND some valid proof of my payment and purchase. 30K is not chana-singdana. I am given a paltry receipt without any order number to keep.This shopper advised that buying something off-the-shelf from Vijay (like a barbecue grill) was alright but dont count on any kind of after-sales installation.Fortunately, we can just look at the street art idea behind this particular sales promotion and be amused  probably the way most non-Vijay customers were. Ill also drop a line to Sunil Shibad in Mumbai  maybe he knows this campaign or the retailer. Meantime, Merry Christmas Eve!http://rpc.icerocket.com:10080/
