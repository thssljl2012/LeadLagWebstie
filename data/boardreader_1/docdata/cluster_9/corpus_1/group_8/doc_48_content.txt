GREEN BAY -- Green Bay Packers president Mark Murphy, like most NFL owners, is watching closely to see who emerges as the next director of the NFL Players Association. Members of the NFLPA, including Packers right tackle Mark Tauscher and former University of Wisconsin athletic director Pat Richter, are meeting in Hawaii to choose the union's next leader. Ex-UW cornerback Troy Vincent is among the four finalists.  'It's going to have huge ramifications for the league, really at a crucial time for the league as we head into the end of the collective bargaining agreement,' Murphy said during FanFest Saturday. 'The next leader of the union will really have a huge impact on the negotiations. So hopefully they'll get somebody in there.'  Murphy said ownership has been criticized for not pressing negotiations with the prospect of an uncapped year in 2010 and the CBA expiring on March 1, 2011, but that the NFL has been waiting for the players to choose a leader.
