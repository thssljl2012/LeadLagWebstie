BELLEVUE, Wash.  Police normally advise against citizens putting themselves in harm's way, but 41-year-old Kristopher Beal of Kirkland is a 6-4, 200-pound former Marine who had a significant size advantage over the suspect.  Beal was at a Bank of America branch in a grocery store Feb. 27 when he noticed the robber forcing a teller to turn over crash. Beal grabbed and held the man until officers arrived.  The suspect was carrying a knife, pepper spray and flare gun.  Beal says he just didn't want a robbery happening in his city.
