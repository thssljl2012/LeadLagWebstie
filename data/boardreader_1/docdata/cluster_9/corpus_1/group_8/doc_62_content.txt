Thieves were unsuccessful in stealing the bank machine from a Tappen business, but did thousands of dollars of damage during their attempt.   When Salmon Arm RCMP responded to a report of a break-in at 5 a.m. Sunday at the Tappen Co-op store in Tappen, they found that a vehicle had been driven through the front doors.   Although the store was open for business Monday, the front of the store had sustained extensive damage, along with a couple of coolers and the ATM.   Police say the suspects wrapped a chain around the ATM and attempted to drag it out of the store, but were unsuccessful.   A witness in the area observed a large dual-wheeled truck rapidly leaving the area, reports Sgt. Eric Castle. It was subsequently learned that the truck had been stolen from the Armstrong area earlier in the night/morning. The truck will now have fresh rear end damage.  The whole front of the store was damaged and consequently boarded up following the theft attempt.   Thats what happens when you drive a dualie through it, remarked a Co-op employee.   Police ask that anyone with information regarding the break and enter of the co-op and/or theft of the truck contact the Salmon Arm detachment at 250-832-6044 or the North Okanagan detachment at 250-546-3028.
