FREMONT, Calif. -- Fremont police this morning arrested a 22-year-old man allegedly responsible for the brutal beating and robbery of an elderly woman earlier this week, a police spokesman said.  The arrest of Jose Antonio Rodriguez Flores came after police released a photo of the suspect to the news media and a citizen recognized Flores' image on the evening news, according to police spokesman Bill Veteran.  Flores was arrested at about 11 a.m. without incident while leaving his home in Fremont's Irvington District, according to Veteran. 'Based on the interview and the evidence recovered from him, our detectives are 100 percent positive that he's the one that committed the robbery,' Veteran said. The beating and robbery occurred around 4:15 p.m. Monday at a home on Pagosa Way where a 75-year-old Milpitas woman was kicked, punched and dragged into the street, Veteran said.  The suspect reportedly had followed the victim from a Bank of America branch in Warm Springs before beating her and stealing her purse, which contained $1,000 in cash, police said.  The victim suffered bruises and cuts to her face, and was taken to a hospital, police said.
