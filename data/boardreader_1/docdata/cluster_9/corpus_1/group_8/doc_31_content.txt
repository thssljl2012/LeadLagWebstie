 William G. Kelso is accused of taking $100 from US Bank on Thursday. By TERRY McCONN of the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin  WALLA WALLA -- A man is facing a first-degree robbery charge for allegedly taking $100 from US Bank on Thursday afternoon. Officials said William G. Kelso, 63, of 200 Chase Ave., No. 1, entered the bank at 22 E. Alder St. shortly before 4:45 p.m. and said he needed some money. When a female employee told him there was no money in his account, he allegedly became angry, moved his hand into his jacket, brought out his hand shaped like a gun and said, 'Bang.' The employee then was terrified and in order to get Kelso to leave, she told him she could advance him the money, according to a police report filed in court. After signing the withdrawal slip, Kelso again twice motioned with his hand as if it were a gun. Kelso reportedly left after thanking the employee for the money. He was arrested at Fourth Avenue and Chestnut Street about a half-hour later. The formal charge was filed Friday in Walla Walla County Superior Court. Bail was set at $15,000.
