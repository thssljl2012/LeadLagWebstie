A plan to open the Sheridan Park swimming pool at 9 a.m., rather than 7 a.m., has been sunk because of swimmers complaints.  It is a small but in a way significant issue, said Lou Oviedo, an attorney and early morning swimmer who organized a petition drive to oppose the hours reduction.  Oviedo regularly uses the sixlane indoor pool before going to work at 9 a.m.; about two dozen others take advantage of the early morning hours. Although waiting for a lane is common before 9 a.m., after that the number of swimmers thins out.  Most swimmers did not oppose another plan to improve the parks finances: a $20 charge for ten weeks of adult lap swim use, which took effect January 5.  We can pay the money, said Lily Yu, Just dont cut the hours. Seven is perfect for me, said Ging Chan, who has to be at his job at Bank of America at 9 a.m.  Luke Capuano, a 27-year park employee, and friends often use the weight room at 7 a.m. Its hours, too, were in danger of being trimmed. He has seen increased use of both weights and the pool.
