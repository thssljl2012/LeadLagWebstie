  Staff Writer Police were looking Saturday for a man who robbed an Ormond Beach bank late Friday afternoon and eluded a search that included the Volusia County sheriff's helicopter.  At 2:45 p.m. Friday, a lone man approached a teller at Bank of America on 299 N. Nova Rd., said he had a gun and demanded money, according to an Ormond Beach police news release. The teller complied and the suspect left the bank. He was last seen running toward woods east of the bank.  A search for the suspect by police and the Volusia County Sheriff's Office and its helicopter was unsuccessful.  The suspect is described as a white male, about 5 feet 7 inches tall and 160 pounds. He was wearing a camouflage printed cap, a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and cargo pants. Anyone with information is asked to call Ormond Beach police at 386-677-0731 or Crime Stoppers at 888-277-8477.
