 MELISSA MARTIN  A station sire from Queenslands north has taken out the prestigious 2009 Rocky Rush National Australia Bank Senior Challenge, held over the weekend at Gracemere Selling Complex.  After three days of campdrafting, cutting, and dry work competition, Jason Wanstall, manager of Byerwen Station, Collinsville, was the victor, winning the Senior Challenge riding six-year-old Quarter Horse stallion, Diablos Destino.  The stallion, by Acres Destiny and out of Lady in Red, is owned by Colinta Holdings, which also owns Byerwen Station.  The equally highly-coveted Queensland Country Life Junior Challenge was won by Karl Burton, Box Ridge, Jondaryan, riding five-year-old Quarter Horse mare, Oaks Penny.  Capricorn Horse Association president Regan Lyons said nominations were up on last year's entries, with a field of 37 horses taking on the Senior Challenge, and 70 horses entered in the Junior Challenge.  The 39th Annual Rockhampton Quarter Horse Sale followed the Rush on the Monday.  Day One of the two-day sale saw an impressive offering of colts, stallions and geldings go under the hammer, reaching a sale high of $20,000, when William and Tracey Tapp, Lonesome Dove, Wowan, sold 18-month-old led Quarter Horse colt, Fortyniner Colonal, to Wayne and Rachael Bean, Katherine, NT.  * See this weeks Queensland Country Life for more stories from the 2009 Rocky Rush and 39th Annual Rockhampton Quarter Horse Sale.
