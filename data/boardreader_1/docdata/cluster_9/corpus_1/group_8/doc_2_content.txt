FREMONT, Calif. -- Police are looking for a man they say robbed a 75 year-old woman Monday afternoon. Police say the robber saw the woman withdraw one-thousand dollars from a bank, followed her, snatched her purse, and beat her.  The incident started at a Bank of America branch in Fremont's Warm Springs neighborhood. Police say the victim drove to a relative's home after she left the bank. They say when she got out of the vehicle, she was attacked. 'He repeatedly hits her in the face with his fists and begins kicking her,' says Detective Bill Veteran of the Fremont Police Department. 'He manages to drag her across the driveway across the sidewalk to the street about 20 feet, where he manage to pull the purse from her, then runs and gets into a vehicle driven by another male we believe.'Police say after taking the woman's purse, the robber tried to use the woman's credit car at a Wal-mart in Union City. However, they say the transaction was denied. Police have a picture and are circulating it in effort to find the robber. 'It's our fear that he's done it in the past and he'll do it again and anyone that would do this to a 75-year-old woman quite frankly doesn't need to be out here with the rest of us,' says Fremont Police Detective Bill Veteran.  One of woman's friends says she recently had back surgery and the robber kicked her in the back during the attack. Police say photos show bruises and multiple lacerations on her face and body.
