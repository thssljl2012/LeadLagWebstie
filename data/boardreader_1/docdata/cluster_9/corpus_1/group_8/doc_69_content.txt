Tonight is full moon night (rising at 7:13 pm). Have you picked your spot? If you're out at Point Bonita, you can capture the top of the Golden Gate Bridge (north tower) with the rising moon. Or perhaps you'll take a walk on the Golden Gate Bridge itself, where at the north tower you'll see the full moon top Alcatraz. In the City, if you shoot off Divisadero Street at Broadway, there is a good chance you'll capture the moon between the Bank of America Building and the Transamerica Pyramid.  All this barring bad weather, of course. Love to hear about your adventures on the blog the day after. Good luck out there.
