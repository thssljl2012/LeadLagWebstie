Police believe the man who used a note to rob the Mars National Bank branch at Russellton early Tuesday was the same man who robbed a nearby First Commonwealth Bank branch a month earlier.  The man was tracked by a police dog to a nearby street but the dog then lost the scent.  No one was injured.  Anyone with information is asked to call West Deer police at 724-265-1100 or the FBI at 412-432-4000. More  Breaking headlines
