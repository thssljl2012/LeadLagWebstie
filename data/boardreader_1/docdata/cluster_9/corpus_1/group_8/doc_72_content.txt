A rash of robberies in bank parking lots has prompted police in the East Valley to caution patrons about carrying large amounts of cash and keeping tabs on their surroundings.   The most recent robbery, on Feb. 27, was at a Bank of America in Chandler.   Other robberies occurred in Tempe and Mesa.  In all, seven people in three cities have been robbed by the same man since Dec. 31, sometimes threatening them with a gun, other times only simulating he had it, said Detective David Ramer, a Chandler police spokesman. There may be a second man involved, though police believe it was the same suspect who approached all of the victims. 'What's concerning about this is the potential for violence,' Ramer said. 'He's already shown that he's willing to show the weapon.' Detectives in Chandler, Tempe and Mesa are working together to share information and chase leads, Ramer said.   Ramer said only that the total amount stolen from all victims was less than $15,000, and that each customer had a deposit bag or some other cash-filled tote that the robber demanded.   Police described the robber as a black man in his 20s, about 6-feet tall, with a medium build and weighing between 150 and 200 pounds. He is often unshaven and wears a hat, hooded sweatshirt or other head covering. Police do not have a description for the second man.   Police are advising patrons to be aware of their surroundings and to bring a second person along when making deposits with large amounts of cash. And if customers or bank employees see anything suspicious, police are asking them to call. 'We'd rather come out find out it's nothing rather than miss a chance to catch this guy,' he said. 'The bottom line is we want people safe, and we want these people caught.'
