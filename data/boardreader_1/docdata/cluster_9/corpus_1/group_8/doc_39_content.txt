LAKEPORT Lakeport police arrested Lakeport resident Adan Lupercio Casares, 40, on a felony robbery charge Thursday night.  Casares was identified as the alleged culprit in a Thursday morning armed robbery at the Lakeport Car Wash on Martin Street, according to Lt. Brad Rasmussen of the Lakeport Police Department (LPD).  Casares was allegedly holding a small folding knife when he allegedly approached a 16-year-old male and demanded the teen's money, according to LPD reports.  Rasmussen said the victim identified Casares as the alleged robber in a photo lineup the day of the incident. Officers located Casares at his Lakeport home and arrested him shortly before 11 p.m. He is held at the Lake County Jail on $10,000 bail.  Rasmussen said police are still investigating and have not determined whether Casares is the same man who was reported asking for money near the ATM at the Bank of America the day before the incident.
