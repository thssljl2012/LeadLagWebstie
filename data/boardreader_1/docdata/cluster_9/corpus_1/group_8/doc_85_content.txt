Jeremiah Kapfer, 27, formerly of West Mifflin, is charged with the March 17 robbery of Mars National Bank on Creighton-Russellton Road, FBI Special Agent William J. Crowley said.   West Deer police said earlier that the man is suspected in the Feb. 18 robbery of the nearby First Commonwealth Bank on Little Deer Creek Valley Road.   Police also want to question him about other area holdups.   Police have said the description of the suspect in the Mars National and First Commonwealth robberies matches the description of the person who robbed a First Commonwealth branch on Saxonburg Road in Shaler on March 7.   In the Mars National case, the suspect handed a note to a clerk and asked for $20 bills.   In the February robbery at First Commonwealth, the suspect warned the clerk not to put an exploding dye packet in with the money.   No gun was seen or threatened in either case.   Kapfer was last seen in motels on Route 8 in the North Hills and is believed to still be in the area, Crowley said.   Kapfer has a criminal history, but Crowley did not immediately have information on his arrest record.   Brian C. Rittmeyer can be reached at brittmeyer@tribweb.com or 724-226-4701.
