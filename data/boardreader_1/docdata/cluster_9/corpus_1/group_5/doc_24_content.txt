A bandit robbed a Rockville Centre Bank of America late yesterday morning and fled, Nassau County police said.  The victim teller gave the man cash -- police didn't make public how much -- after he walked into the bank, at 152 N. Village Ave., and gave the teller a threatening note demanding money, police said.  The bandit fled on foot. Three employees were in the bank at the time. No one was injured, police said.
