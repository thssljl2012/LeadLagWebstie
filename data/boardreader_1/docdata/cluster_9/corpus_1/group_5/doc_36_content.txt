A gun-toting cross-dresser tied up and assaulted staff before robbing a Sydney bank.  Police say three male employees were opening the Commonwealth Bank at North Strathfield, in Sydney's inner west, when a man wearing a black dress and a shoulder-length blonde wig stormed inside about 8.30am (AEDT) on Tuesday.  The staff handed over cash to the man, who was armed with a handgun, and he fled the Concord Road building on foot.  Detective Inspector Hans Rupp of the Robbery and Serious Crimes Squad said investigators were still scouring the crime scene on Tuesday afternoon. 'There was one lone offender, dressed as a woman, who was clearly a man,' Det Insp Rupp told reporters. 'A number of staff were assaulted during the commission of the offence and tied up. 'After the offender escaped, we don't know which way he went.' An employee of a neighbouring business told AAP he came to work about 8am and noticed a man sitting on a bench across the street. 'It appeared to be a guy dressed as a lady,' said the man, who asked not to be identified. 'He was dressed in black, with a black dress, black stockings, a blonde wig and he had facial hair.' 'I didn't take notice of it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. 'About 10-15 minutes later, I heard cop cars parked out the front.' A Commonwealth Bank spokeswoman said no one was injured during the incident and staff involved were offered counselling.
