Great Day Breakfast Burritos, Sausage, Egg and Cheese: 440 calories, 19 grams fat, 120 mg cholesterol, 1,070 mg sodium, 52 grams carbs.  It seems that in every one of these comparisons, there's one serious misfire, one product that, through inattention, poor formulation or just plain bad culinary thinking, fails miserably. These burritos would definitely fill that category. While there is an oven-cooking option, the microwave preparation was used to keep things equal. The end result was a soggy tortilla, flavorless filling and a tongue-bludgeoning amount of salt. Oh, and the tortilla gets greasy on the outside, presenting a danger to your business clothes. Final grade: D-.  Red Baron Biscuit-Style Scrambles, Bacon: 390 calories, 19 grams fat, 65 mg cholesterol, 970 mg sodium, 37 grams carbs.  One of the best frozen pizzas on the market also proves to be one of the best frozen breakfasts around. Just pop the pizza onto the nifty crisper tray, let the microwave do its voodoo, and you'll be presented with a tender-in-the-middle, crispy-on-the-edges pizza topped with two cheeses, scrambled eggs and a generous helping of bacon. Note: If you've got a microwave with a turntable, you can just heat it for 4 minutes and skip the "stop and turn" step. Final grade: A+.  Aunt Jemima Griddlecake Sandwiches, Sausage, Egg and Cheese: 350 calories, 20 grams fat, 150 mg cholesterol, 900 mg sodium, 30 grams carbs.  Remember the "bad culinary thinking" mentioned above? Well, it rears its ugly head in this entry. It's an obvious attempt to recreate the McDonald's McGriddle in the freezer case, but it goes way too far over the sweetness line. The pancakes that serve as buns are cloyingly sweet. and the artificial maple flavor completely drowns out the sausage, egg and cheese. It also has a tendency to be a bit slippery, making one-handed eating challenging. Final grade: C-.  So the Red Baron flies away with the win here by a whisker over the Jimmy Dean omelets, and the pizzas actually also win as the best buy, coming in at just over a dollar apiece. For a breakfast this good, that's a real steal.   Copyright 2008, Internet Broadcasting. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. The story  is provided by .
