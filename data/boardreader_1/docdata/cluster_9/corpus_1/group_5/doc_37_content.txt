Police are hunting a bandit dressed as a woman who has held up a bank in Sydney's west. Laura Tunstall is at North Strathfield.  Terrified Commonwealth bank staff called police around 8:50am this morning.  They had been opening up the branch on Concord Road at North Strathfield when a man walked in with a handgun.  He threatened them; and there are also reports they may have been tied up - he then fled with cash on foot.  Most unusual is the description witnesses have provided police of the robber - local business owners saying they saw a man dressed in women's clothing, black stockings and a blonde wig sitting at the bus stop across the road.  That's now a crime scene established.   None of the staff were injured during the robbery - just badly shaken.
