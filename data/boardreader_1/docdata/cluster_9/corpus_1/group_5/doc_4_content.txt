DUBAI, United Arab Emirates " Annika Sorenstam, the former World No. 1, flew into Dubai Monday morning, looking relaxed and upbeat ahead of the Dubai Ladies Masters where she will be making her last competitive appearance.  A few hours after arriving in Dubai she posed against the stunning backdrop of the Burj Al Arab at the Madinat Jumeirah, surrounded by the next generation of European golfers.  She was joined by some of the future stars of the LET, including Maria Verchenova of Russia, Australian Frances Bondad, Nina Reis of Sweden, Norways Marianne Skarpnord and French rookies Caroline Afonso and Julie Greciet, all of whom are yet to win their first tournament on the LET.   It was kind of an honour to pose with Annika at her last event, said Bondad, who was the No. 1 ranked Australian amateur from 2006-2007 before she turned professional in December.   Skarpnord, who was second at the 2008 AIB Ladies Irish Open, added: Shes the best, so of course we will miss her.   Sorenstam, who broke almost every record over her 15 years as a professional, is hoping to end on a high note by winning the title in Dubai for the third year running.   She has won 89 career titles, including 10 major championships since 1994, but she was also famous for playing against the men at the Colonial Bank of America Tournament in Fort Worth in 2003 and shooting 59 (-13) at the 2001 Standard Register Ping.   At the end of the week she will hang up her golf shoes to start a family and pursue her business interests such as her academy and golf course design projects. She will marry Mike McGee in January.
