Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  POLICE are hunting for a woman dubbed the 'hot chocolate thief' who has allegedly stolen tens of thousands of dollars from her victims.  Police believe the thief has poured hot chocolate on three different women in Melbourne's CBD last month before taking the victims into nearby toilets to help them clean the mess, the Herald Sun reports.  During that time she has managed to steal a total of $24,000 in cash from the women.  On November 12, about 11.10am, a woman withdrew $20,000 from the Commonwealth Bank on the corner of Collins and Queen Streets, and walked to Flinders Street where hot chocolate was poured over her back from behind when she was outside Banana Alley.  Police said the suspected thief approached the woman and offered her tissues before leading her into a toilet in a nearby fitness centre to help clean her. The cash is believed to have then been taken from the victim's handbag.  The alleged thief is believed to be in her 40s and is described as Caucasian, 165cm tall with red and brown straight shoulder-length hair.  She has an eastern European accent and on this occasion was wearing a grey business suit.  Police believe the woman was also responsible for two similar thefts.
