DEGEM'S latest line of Soleluna jewellery, the Dusk &amp;amp; Dawn collection, is designed to complement the wearer from the boardroom to the dance floor. This collection comprises a range of New-Age gemstones with strong colour characteristics and individuality.   The Dusk series offers the deep, earthy tone of smoky quartz, providing the strong contrasting characteristic against delicate pav diamonds with white and rose gold setting. The mysterious depth of dark brown is a perfect match for darker-toned party outfits.  The Dawn series offers a sunny, vital tone of lemon quartz, providing a highly refreshing tone of intense yellow in a matching champagne pav diamonds with white and black gold setting as its moodier equivalent. The lively bright yellow offers a counterbalance of warmth for power suits and semi-formal outfits. ''Silver jewellery is overrated now,'' DeGem chief designer Vivien Koh said. ''There is an urgent need to offer fashionable Malaysian women an alternative and a more sophisticated jewellery range, where the product value is higher, the design is trendier, yet pricing competitive with other international brands. We are glad to offer exactly that.'' The Dusk &amp;amp; Dawn collection is now available at all DeGem outlets in Malaysia and Singapore.  Until the end of the month, with every purchase of Soleluna's new Dusk &amp;amp; Dawn collection, customers will receive a Karen Millen shopping voucher (RM100 off for an RM600 purchase), Mini Cooper Weekend Drive and an exclusive DeGem imported jewellery box.   Citibank platinum cardholders enjoy a 20 per cent discount on this collection. Terms and conditions apply.
