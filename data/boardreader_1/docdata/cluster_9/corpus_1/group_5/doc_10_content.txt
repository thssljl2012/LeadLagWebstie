 Paso Robles police released surveillance camera photos today of a man who robbed a Paso Robles bank Dec. 4 in an effort to track him down.  The man, who has not been identified, walked into a Bank of America at 1511 Spring St. around 11:15 a. m. and showed a note to a teller demanding money, police said.  The black and white photographs were taken while the robbery was in progress. After the suspect walked out of the bank, heading northwest, officers searched the area but were unable to find him, police said.   No gun was seen or simulated during the robbery.  Bank employees described the robber as a white man who appeared to be about 40 years old, 6 feet tall with a thin build and wearing a two-toned, possibly blue and tan baseball cap, sunglasses, a tan jacket, a Hawaiian-style button-up shirt and blue jeans, police said.
