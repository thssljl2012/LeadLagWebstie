A man wearing a black dress, matching stockings and a long blonde wig robbed a bank at gunpoint in Sydney Tuesday, but blew his disguise by failing to shave, police said.   'There was one lone offender, dressed as a woman, who was clearly a man,' Detective Inspector Hans Rupp of the Robbery and Serious Crimes Squad told reporters.  The unshaven cross-dresser tied up three employees of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney's inner west as they were opening for the day before fleeing on foot with an undisclosed amount of cash. 'After the offender escaped, we don't know which way he went,' Rupp said. An employee of a neighbouring business told the national AAP news agency he noticed a man sitting on a bench across the street as he arrived for work in the morning. 'It appeared to be a guy dressed as a lady,' he said. 'He was dressed in black, with a black dress, black stockings, a blonde wig about shoulder length and he had facial hair,' the man said. 'He was just sitting there. I didn't take notice of it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. About 1-15 minutes later, I heard cop cars park out the front.' A Commonwealth Bank spokeswoman said no one was injured during the incident and staff involved had been offered counselling at the crime scene.  Last week in Paris, four armed robbers -- two of them dressed as women -- pulled off one of the world's biggest jewellery heists, making off with 17 million dollars in diamonds and other valuables.
