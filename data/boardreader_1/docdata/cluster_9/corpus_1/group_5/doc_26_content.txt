CHARLOTTE -- As soon as North Carolina quarterback T.J Yates unloaded the ball, he knew there could be trouble.  It was at that moment that the offensive and defensive lines parted and Yates finally saw West Virginia linebacker Pat Lazear jumping wide receiver Cooter Arnold's route for a game-breaking interception.  For almost 58 minutes Saturday at Bank of America Stadium -- home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers -- Yates made the right decisions, but his one mistake came at the worst possible moment for the Tar Heels. With UNC unable to stop the clock, West Virginia took three knees to run out the remaining seconds of its 31-30 victory in the Meineke Car Care Bowl. 'I couldn't see (Lazear), he was kind of blinded by the offensive and defensive line but as soon as I let it go, I saw him come into my vision,' Yates said after the game. 'He made a good play. He dropped back into coverage, read that little short route.' Given the manner in which the game began, it seemed impossible that a defensive play would determine the winner.  North Carolina (8-5) punted to end its first possession, but then it was all offense for about the next 15 minutes.  First it was West Virginia's Noel Devine notching an 18-yard touchdown run to put the Mountaineers up 7-0. Three plays later, UNC's Hakeem Nicks answered with an acrobatic one-handed catch for a 73-yard score.  The two teams put up 35 points and nearly 400 total yards of offense in the game's opening stanza. And most of those yards came via the big play. There was Nicks' 73-yard catch, a 44-yard touchdown pass by WVU quarterback Pat White and then another big play by Nicks -- this one for 66-yard touchdown catch from Arnold on a trick play.  All the offensive excitement kept the fans from settling into their seats -- and left the coaches shaking their heads.
