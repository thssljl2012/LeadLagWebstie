A FORMER governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been found safe and well after going missing from his Sydney home.  Sir Harold Knight, 89, left an aged care facility in Sydney Street, at Willoughby, about 8pm (AEDT) on Saturday, prompting concerns for his welfare from family and police.   Sir Harold, an RBA governor during the Whitlam and Fraser governments, was found in Willoughby by a member of the public late today.  A police spokesman said he was safe and well. 'He was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital for a routine medical check-up,' he said.
