India's Jeev Milka Singh credited his win at the Barclays Singapore Open to the massive support of his family and fans back home.  Singh held off the challenges of double-major winner Padriag Harrington and local favourite Ernie Els to win what the Indian later claimed to be his best victory since the 2006 Volvo China Masters.  After his success at the Sentosa Golf Course, the 37-year-old is now odds-on to win the 2008 Asian Tour Order of Merit race, something Singh believes can be attributed to the constant support that he has been receiving.  'My family and friends have been very supportive of me - through the good and bad times,' said Singh.  'The spectators also trusted me - hanging around and believing in me to come through. And my wife also who is here right now and she has been the big support in my life.'  When asked about how his win would help the rampaging force that is golf in India, Singh was confident that it would provide yet another maor boost for the sport.  'I think it is going to help a lot because every time an Indian (golfer) wins,' he said.  'it is very good for players and young kids coming up and when they see us win, they will feel that of Jeev can do it, if Arjay can do it, why not me?  'The parents also believe it that. If Jeev can do it, our son can do it too. It is going to popularise the game. Golf is the fastest growing sport in the country right now.'  Singh, who pocketed a cool US$792,500 for his efforts, finished off by saying he would be back in Singapore to defend his title in 2009.
