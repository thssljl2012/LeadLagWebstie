Police arrested a 32-year-old Rochester man this morning after a Bank of America branch at 1394 Norton St. was robbed.  City police Capt. Kevin Costello said a man verbally threatened a teller at about 11 a.m., took an unknown amount of cash, then fled on foot. Within moments, Officer Bernie Garcia arrested the suspect on Mitchell Street, Costello said.  No one was injured during the robbery, and police do not believe the suspect used a weapon.  Police are questioning the man, and charges are likely to be filed later tonight, Costello said. q
