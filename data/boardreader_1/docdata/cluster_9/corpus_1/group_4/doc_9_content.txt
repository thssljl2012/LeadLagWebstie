A fund-raising event to raise money for a charity in Pakistan was held in Bradford last night.   More than 400 people attended Bringing Light to Lives, at the Cedar Court Hotel on Rooley Lane, for a charity dinner aiming to help cure blindness in Pakistan.   The event, run by Bradford-based QED-UK, expected to raise around 50,000 for the Alshifa Trust, which runs three hospitals in Pakistan.   Founder Dr Mohammed Ali said: It has been a fantastic response. The hospitals in Pakistan are in the Kashmir region and there are many links to Bradford.
