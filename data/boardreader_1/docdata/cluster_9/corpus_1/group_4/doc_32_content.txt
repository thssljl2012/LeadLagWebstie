The Canadian Press: Reg Varney, a comic actor who played a cheery Cockney bus driver in the British sitcom 'On the Buses,' died Sunday, his daughter said. He was 92. In addition to his television career, Varney also secured his place in history by making the world's first withdrawal from an ATM, at a branch of Barclays Bank in Enfield, north London in 1967.
