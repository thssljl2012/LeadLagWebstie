According to Turriff, RH was considering its involvement in BEC for 2009 before the current economic downturn really took hold. This decision isnt about saving money, said Turriff, But rather it is about spending our resources in ways that we feel are more effective to promote our authors and their books, to help increase sales for the authors, the booksellers and us. John P. McGeary, v-p of new business development Reed Exhibitions and managing director of BEC said that the situation with Random House was not unexpected.We are doing the consumer orientated event in the fall to give publishers a choice of shows to do. We knew coming out with two shows that there are some publishers that want to do both and others that would pick one or the other. Random House told us that it is still leaving the door open to the fall consumer show. Reed announced in September it will start a consumer-oriented fair next year in Toronto.  Susan Dayus, executive director Canadian Booksellers Association, said that Random House told the organization the decision shouldnt be viewed as a lack of support for CBA, and that they would be happy to support the association in other ways. Still, Dayus said, Random House of Canadas presence at the event will be missed and many booksellers will be disappointed not to meet their authors and staff during BEC 2009. Other large publishers have yet to say if Random House's choice will influence their decision to attend BEC in June 2009.
