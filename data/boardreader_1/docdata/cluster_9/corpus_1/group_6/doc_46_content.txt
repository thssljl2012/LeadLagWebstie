  COVINA - Police are seeking a man who attempted to rob a Citibank branch Friday morning.   The incident occurred about 10 a.m. at the bank located at 200 N. Citrus Ave., Covina police Lt. John Curley said.   The suspect passed a teller a note reading, 'This is a robbery,' FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.   During the crime, the robber apparently became startled by something and fled empty-handed, Curley said. It wasn't clear Friday what scared the robber off.   The failed robber ran north on Citrus Avenue, through Covina's downtown area, Curley said. A weapon was not seen during the incident.   The teller immediately activated an alarm, he added, and nearby police officers responded quickly. 'We were there within 30 seconds of the call being put out,' the lieutenant said.   Police searched the area but did not find the suspect, he said.   He was described as a black man in his mid-40s, about 6 feet tall, of medium build, with salt and pepper colored hair and a mustache, Curley said.   Officials added the robber wore a dark blue or black baseball cap and a blue shirt or sweater.   FBI officials are investigating the possibility the would-be robber in Covina may be responsible for other area bank robberies, Eimiller said, though he hadn't been definitively linked to any other crimes Friday.
