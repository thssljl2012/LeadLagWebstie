A funeral will be held today at 7 p.m. at St. Mary Catholic Church for a family of four who died in a Pender County mobile home fire.  The church is located at 412 Ann St.   An electric space heater left too close to a sofa started the fire that killed Gerardo Chavira Ramirez, 28, his girlfriend, Gladis Roque, and her two children, 7-year-old Ronald Turcios, and 2-year-old Dayanna Huerta Roque on Jan. 18.  Investigators found the burnt space heater within inches of a sofa in the living room of a single-wide mobile home where Chavira Ramirez lived with his brother, Cesar, who managed to escape through a window. Roque and the two children died in the fire.  The space heater that caused the fire was one of at least five space heaters keeping the home warm about 3 a.m. even though investigators found a central electric furnace. Central heat was not being used at the time, authorities have said. Chavira Ramirez's brother, Tereso Ramirez Santos, said today that the home had no working furnace or air conditioner.  The home, located off U.S. 117 near Pike Creek Road, went up in flames after radiant heat ignited the sofa's fabric, spreading to the rest of the house.  An autopsy confirmed that the family died of smoke inhalation. Ramirez was originally from a town near Mexico City while Roque was from Honduras.  The families plan to send Chaviro Ramirez's body back to Mexico and Roque and her children's bodies to Honduras. They are collecting funds for the burials.  You may donate to Bank of America. The account is under the name of Norma Roque for the benefit of Ronald Josue Turcios Roque. The account number is 237011709228.  Veronica Gonzalez: 343-2008  veronica.gonzalez@starnewsonline.com
