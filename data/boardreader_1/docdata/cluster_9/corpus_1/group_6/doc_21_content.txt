A 37-year-old man died at a hospital Tuesday, more than a week after he was shot in a bank parking lot in West Berkeley, authorities said today.  William Payton of Berkeley was pronounced dead at Highland Hospital in Oakland, according to the Alameda County coroner's office.  Payton was shot about 8:15 p.m. Jan. 11 in the Bank of America parking lot at 2546 San Pablo Ave., police said.   A suspect in the shooting, Lee Freddy Green, turned himself in the next morning and was booked at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin on suspicion of attempted murder. Prosecutors are expected to amend the charge to murder.  Green, a painter who turns 51 on Saturday, is being held without bail.   E-mail Henry K. Lee at hlee@sfchronicle.com.
