Lidstrom, Datsyuk won't play in NHL's All-Star Weekend            Nicklas Lidstrom, #5 of the Detroit Red Wings, won't be putting in to put in an appearance at the NHL's All-Star Weekend in Montreal.  Photograph by: Jamie Squire,   Detroit Red Wings general manager Ken Holland won't ask Nick Lidstrom and Pavel Datsyuk to put in appearances at the NHL's All-Star Weekend in Montreal even though the league announced Friday they'll be suspended for one game if the injured duo don't show up to support the festivities.  While the NHL doesn't expect them to play, they want all players named to the All-Star Game to attend regardless so they can work the buffet circuit with advertisers and the media.  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman will invoke a clause in the CBA that states unless a player misses the game before the All-Star Break or the game after, he will be suspended for a game for not showing up even if he doesn't play.  'I'm not going to call Nick and tell him he's got to go to Montreal to sit and talk with the media for a day,' said a fiery Holland, who is upset with the NHL's treatment of Lidstrom on this issue.  'Imagine me calling Nick, a six-time Norris Trophy winner, four-time Stanley Cup winner and someone who has gone to the last 10 All-Star Games and telling him he can't spend the time with his four boys and wife.  'I have too much respect for Nick because I know he's playing in pain. He's shown up at every NHL Awards show he's been nominated for. He's done everything the league has asked him to do.  'He's put in his time and he's paid his dues. I'm backing my player because I know he's hurt.'  Holland said Lidstrom came to him Monday to tell him the tendonitis in his right elbow was flaring up. The Wings' captain had an MRI done Wednesday and Holland said they found a small tear.  'This has been an ongoing problem for Nick for a number of years, but it's only gotten worse as he's gotten older,' Holland said.  'The tear isn't really significant, but it'll only heal with rest. He felt a week off would help get him back healthy.  'He's never come to me and asked out of the game before, so I know he's hurting.  'There's a chance he might not play Tuesday (even if he's suspended). We're fortunate to have some points in the bank and we're looking at the long term here.'  Holland was equally passionate about the possible suspension to Datsyuk, who has a hip flexor injury.  He pointed out the Wings are already missing Johan Franzen after he tried to play through a sore hip last weekend in San Jose.  'We're being cautious here because the last time I saw Franzen he couldn't play and wasn't walking well,' Holland said.  'I have trouble asking players to go to Montreal who are injured. I don't even know where the two of them are.'  Holland said he explained all this to NHL vice-president Colin Campbell earlier this week.  Holland said he has no plans to call the league again.  'I don't know exactly what Gary has said, but we've always encouraged our players to go and they have over the years,' Holland said.  'We played in the Winter Classic when asked even though there was some internal opposition. We gave up our traditional New Year's Eve game.  'We've helped carry the flag for the league for more than a decade. I think we've tried to be good partners in these things.  'I understand the All-Star Game is important, but I'm not going to tell Nick and Pavel to go either.'  The Wings play at Columbus Tuesday and will likely also be missing Brad Stuart and Franzen with injuries.  Lidstrom and Datsyuk will likely be held out of that game giving them a full 10 days rest between games and avoiding having to forfeit their pay for being suspended.
