The PGA Tour received an economic jolt when U.S. Bank announced plans to end its title sponsorship of the U.S. Bank Championship in Milwaukee after this year. Milwaukee, played opposite the British Open, has struggled with poor attendance and low TV ratings, according to a report Tuesday in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. U.S. Bank had a three-year option on its contract, which expires after the July 16-19 event at Brown Deer Park Golf Course. The event, which for 36 years did not have a title sponsor before U.S. Banks deal in 2004, has been part of the Tour schedule since 1968. Tournament officials told the Journal Sentinel that they will work with the Tour to find a new sponsor. If unsuccessful, the events future in Milwaukee could be in jeopardy. Bill Bertha, president of the Wisconsin market for U.S. Bank, told the Journal Sentinel that local interest had waned. A very good analogy, Bertha said, is that we threw a multimillion-dollar party for Milwaukee and Wisconsin, in a park with tents, refreshments and entertainment  all the bells and whistles  and nobody showed up. It was just apathy out there. Paul Knoebel, president of the tournaments board, cited the millions of dollars for charity raised at the event and called U.S. Bank an extremely good friend of the tournament. Tournament director Dan Croak, contacted by the Journal Sentinel while in Phoenix for the FBR Open, promised a first-class event for U.S. Banks final year in Milwaukee and vowed to seek a sponsor for next year. The Milwaukee event was shifted in 2007 to be played the same week as the British Open. With the move, Milwaukee lost its spot on network TV and was broadcast on Golf Channel. As a result, local interest waned, the Journal Sentinel reported, though tournament officials do not release attendance figures. The bottom line is, nobody watched it on TV, Bertha said. Nobody from around the Midwest  or, for that matter, from Wisconsin  came. It was not a big regional or state draw.
