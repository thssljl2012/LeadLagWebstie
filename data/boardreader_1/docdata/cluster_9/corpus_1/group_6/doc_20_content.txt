Police are looking for a man who held up Bank of America on the corner of Montague and West Laurel avenues in Greenwood just after 1 p.m. Wednesday.  The suspect was armed, and though there were several customers and employees in the bank, no one was hurt, Greenwood Police Lt. Chris Gray said.  The suspect walked up to the tellers window inside the bank with a handgun -- a silver revolver -- and demanded money, Gray said.  No shots were fired. The suspect left the bank with an undisclosed amount of money and took off in a late-model black Mercedes, or similar vehicle, Gray said.  Police are looking for a man who was captured by the banks surveillance cameras. He is a black male, thought to be in his 30s, wearing sunglasses, blue jeans and a stocking cap.
