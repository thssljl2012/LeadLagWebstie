John Bertrand, Ben Ainslie and Andrew Palfrey, amongst the leading contenders in the Commonwealth Bank 2009 Etchells Australian title, being held at the Royal SA Yacht Squadron (Squadron) suffered a major scare after noticing damage after a practice sail in the strong sea breezes off the Adelaide coast. Andrew Palfrey said Triad suffered 'structural damage to chainplate structures and bulkheads. It happened on Port Tack going out of the river, in winds of 27knots'. Continuing he said 'the boat just really started slamming'. Triad was new in September and repairs were by undertaken by Peter Strangways, the crew of Triad are confident that the damage will not affect their chances with John Bertrand laughing saying 'It didnt sink, so no worries, unlike 1995!' With only hours to go, and all boats now in the water, other hot crews are out practicing in the strong sea breezes on the azure waters of Gulf St Vincent. Skip Lissimans Bandwagon with crew Andy Fethers, Keith Swinton, Tyson Lamond ; the 06- 07 Australian Champions, were looking sharp and fast when sailing this afternoon. Two crews didnt make the weight requirements and are jammed into the local sauna, with a salad and a sober night in store. Pre-race festivities have commenced with a welcoming cocktail party. The practice race starts tomorrow at 13:00, with racing starting on Monday at 11:00 continuing all week. With 44 boats entered and with perfect but somewhat warm weather forecast the buzz at the Squadron is electric. Sponsors have been quick to jump aboard, recognising the contribution sailing makes to the local community and keen to associate with a healthy outdoor sport. Sponsors include; The Commonwealth Bank, MUSTO, Club Marine Insurance, Coopers Brewery, Jacobs Creek Wines, Kaesler Wines and Aircommand Australia and the Royal SA Yacht Squadron.
