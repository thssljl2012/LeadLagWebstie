Have you noticed this new subgenre of subway ads that try to be all in-the-know about New York but fail? Like Bank of America's transit-rebate ads that cap off with faux-cranky lines like: 'Great. Now where can I get a cheap studio below 23rd Street?' As though cheap studios below 23rd Street are any harder to come by than those above. And now we have these New Yorksubtypespecific 'checklist' ads from the FlatRate moving company. Like the 'Hipster Move' one ('Fold skinny jeans/ironic T-shirts/flannel into Flatrate wardrobe boxes'). Ew. You just know the suits at these companies hired the hippest creative team they could find in the city to make them. Kansas City. [EV Grieve]
