 THE thieves involved in Wednesday's automatic teller heist are still on the run with police appealing for any information from the public.  Detective Inspector Mark Wright, from Devonport CIB, said yesterday police had received some new information but no further witnesses had come forward.  'We have nothing to add to what was said yesterday,' he said.  The attack occurred about 1.15am on Wednesday when two offenders bombed the Latrobe ANZ Bank ATM.  They made off with a substantial amount of money and were last seen walking in the Hampden St area.  Two cash trays were later recovered from Kings Creek on Last St.  Det Insp Wright said there was a possibility more than two people were involved in the heist.  'At the moment we believe two people could have committed this crime and witnesses have seen two people so that's where we are focusing.'  Det Insp Wright said police were now awaiting the results of forensic tests of several exhibits taken from the scene.  The results of those tests could take days.  In the meantime, police have requested that anybody who may have observed suspicious activity in and around Latrobe in the early hours of Tuesday morning to come forward.  One of the offenders is believed to be male, about 175cm tall, wearing a dark, puffer jacket and light coloured jeans.  The other offender is believed to have suffered injuries in the explosion and may be walking with a limp.  Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800333000 or Tasmania Police on 131144.
