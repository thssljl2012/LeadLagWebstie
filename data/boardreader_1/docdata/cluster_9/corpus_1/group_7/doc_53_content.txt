A lone bandit robbed the First Commonwealth Bank branch in Russellton at about 11 a.m. yesterday.  There was a customer and three bank employees there, but no one was hurt, police said.  Police said the man walked through a side entrance off of Little Deer Creek Valley Road. He handed a teller a note that demanded money. The note instructed the teller not to include an exploding dye packet, and she complied, police said.  The man didn't show a gun or suggest that he had one, said Police Chief Jon Lape said.  Police said those inside didn't see much because the robber was in and out, he didn't wear unusual clothing and his face wasn't covered. 'He walked out the same door and walked up Little Deer Creek Valley Road to Starr Road,' Lape said. K-9 officer Ed Newman and his police dog tracked the man from the bank to Starr Road.   Witnesses said the man was seen walking along Little Deer Creek Valley Road within an hour of the robbery.  A young mother from Rural Ridge told a reporter that she was arriving at the bank just as the robber walked away. 'He was in a hurry to get out of here,' she said, holding her infant in a blue snowsuit. 'I saw the man put something into his pocket and I had a bad feeling about this. It didn't look good.' She said the man was tall and thin.  Dozens of customers visited the bank in the hour after the robbery only to find yellow police tape and a sign telling them the branch was closed due to an emergency.  Two FBI agents arrived within 40 minutes and several bank security specialists were quickly ushered inside by police.  According to its Web site, First Commonwealth has about 36 banks and about 40 ATMs in Allegheny County. The bank has branches in 15 counties in southwestern Pennsylvania and elsewhere. 'Everyone is fine,' said bank spokeswoman Susie Barber. 'The employees followed proper security procedure and called the police. We are fully cooperating.' More  News headlines
