An ATM in the western Sydney suburb of Villawood has gone up with a bang this morning, causing extensive damage.  After a loud explosion was heard around 2am today, police arriving on the scene at Woodville Road found the St George Bank ATM a pile of rubble.  At this stage it's unclear if the thieves escaped with cash. Forensics officers are there combing through what's left of the machine to find evidence.  Strike Force Picadilly detectives are involved in the investigation, and are looking for any witnesses to the blast who haven't yet come forward.
