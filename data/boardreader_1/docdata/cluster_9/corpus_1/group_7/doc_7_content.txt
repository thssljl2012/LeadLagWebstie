ALHAMBRA - A man escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash Thursday after robbing a bank, authorities said. The heist was the third time in a month an Alhambra bank has been robbed.  The incident occurred about 11:40 a.m. at a Bank of America branch located inside an Albertsons grocery store at 2400 W. Commonwealth Ave., Alhambra police Lt. Dan Rodriguez said.  The robber used a note to demand money from a teller, he said.  The robber was initially described as a black man wearing a reddish or blondish wig, Rodriguez said. He is about 6 feet tall and was of thin build, and he wore a long-sleeved blue sweat shirt and khaki pants.  A serial robber also robbed an Alhambra bank twice this month, officials said.  A robber the FBI calls the 'Grizzly Adams Bandit,' struck at the First Bank, 711 W. Valley Blvd., on Jan. 6 and again on Jan. 26, Alhambra police said.
