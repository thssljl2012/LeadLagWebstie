The Albany Patroons missed out on a CBA championship last night by a fraction of an inch.  The Patroons hosted Lawton-Fort Sill in a winner-take-all game three of the CBA finals.  The Patroons came from behind to force overtime. And down by two, with seconds left, Harvey Thomas has a three-point try at the buzzer to win it -- so close, but not close enough.  So the Calvary are champs, but under unusual circumstances. A crippling financial crisis forced the league to play the championship more than a month ahead of time -- so the finals never really felt like the finals.  'One day we've got a month left,' said Patroons guard Mike Campbell. 'The next day, we're playing the championship next week, or at the end of next week. So it was kind of different.'  But forward Harvey Thomas isn't blaming the circumstances: 'That doesn't make any difference. It was for all the marbles tonight, and we came up short.'
