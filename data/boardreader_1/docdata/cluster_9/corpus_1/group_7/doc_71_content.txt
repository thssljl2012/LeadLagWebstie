Sid Lane, a retired clothing manufacturer from Taupo, embarked on his mission to travel the 5500km of coast in the small, open-air helicopter on Waitangi Day.  He went from Whakatane to Invercargill without too much trouble, but hasn't been able to leave the southern city since Sunday.  The next leg will take him around coastal Fiordland to Haast, an unforgiving stretch which offers little comfort.  'There's nothing out there but a barren area and there's nowhere to go if something goes wrong.'  Mr Lane was assessing conditions this morning and unsure if he would get off the ground today.  'The longer I sit and think about the next stretch, the less I want to do it  it's not doing me any good,' he said.  The wind was westerly into Invercargill and he hoped it would be southwest once he rounded the south coast.  'If I don't like it, the only thing I can do is turn around and come back to Invercargill, but it's 50-50 whether I get up today.'  He said he could travel at about 130kmh in ideal conditions, but winds could buffet the machine around and keep its top speed to about half that.  Mr Lane, who has been flying gyrocopters for 40 years, is doing the trip to raise money for cancer charities and show them there were still opportunities after surviving cancer.  He was diagnosed with throat cancer last April and was only given the all clear after six months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment.  Anyone who wants to donate towards the journey can do so at any branch of Westpac bank, which has set up a trust for the purpose.
