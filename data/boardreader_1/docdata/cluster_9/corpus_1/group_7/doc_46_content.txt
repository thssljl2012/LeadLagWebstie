From Press staff reports  Second-seeded St. Augustine Prep took command in the second half of the match to beat visiting third-seeded Christian Brothers Academy 39-22 in a South Jersey Non-Public A wrestling semifinal Wednesday.   The Prep trailed 22-15 after the match at 285 but won the final five matches, including one forfeit, from 103 through 130. 'I scouted CBA on Monday against Paul VI, and I thought we'd beat them about 45-18, but they were tougher than I thought,' St. Augustine assistant coach Angel Rivera said. 'I thought we came out a little flat, but we had enough guns, enough fuel in the tank to overcome the lead. Everyone knows that we're real tough down the bottom (in the lighter weights).' St. Augustine (20-10), No. 10 in The Press' Elite 11, travels to top-seeded Camden Catholic on Friday for a 7 p.m. match for the South Jersey Non-Public A championship. Camden Catholic knocked off St. John Vianney 57-12 on Wednesday.   Camden Catholic beat St. Augustine 35-31 in last year's South Jersey final.  Following Joe Esposito's forfeit win at 103, St. Augustine's Mark Patterson (112) won by technical fall, and teammate Joe DeVone (119) scored a 5-1 decision. Prep's A.J. Fisher (125) won by an 11-0 major decision, and Thomas Abbot (130) finished up with a first-period pin.  Other St. Augustine wins were a decision at 140 by Paxtin Burgin (140), a major decision by Nick DiGalbo (145), a decision by Matt Campo (152) and a technical fall by Leon White (189). 'They had a solid team,' said DiGalbo, who improved to 29-2. 'But our lighter weights are strong, and I knew if it came down to them, we'd have a good chance of winning. Now we go against Camden Catholic. Since I was a freshman, we've had a saying of 'A, B and C.' A is Absegami, B is Buena and C is Camden Catholic. We've beaten A and B this year, and now it's time to get the C.' 103 -Joe Esposito SA won by forfeit ; 112 -Mark Patterson SA tf. Frank Lurch 16-0 ; 119 - Joseph Devone SA d.
