England suffered one of their most humiliating defeats of all time in imploding for 51 runs to lose by an innings and 23 runs to West Indies in the first Test. Here, we look at four things they must do as a matter of urgency.   1. Channel the hurt of the defeat positively   There is an argument given it was such a freakish, whirlwind loss, that Andrew Strauss' team can use it as a motivation for winning the series. England do have a recent history of performing when pride has been wounded, most notably when they overturned crushing defeats in Australia two years ago to win the Commonwealth Bank Series.   2. Drop Ian Bell   The number three position in a side is crucial for setting the tone of an innings and Bell has proved too timid a creature. He has been residing in a comfort zone for a long time at international level but has surely now come to the end of the line. Few doubt his technical talent but his mental application is poor.   3. Play with greater discipline   West Indies were far superior in this department - not something you would have dreamed of saying over the last decade - which subsequently set up the triumph. They batted responsibly to eke out a 74-run lead and then produced a measured bowling display.   4. Work on team spirit   For all their talk of a united front, the England camp still appear to have issues at the start of this year, whether it be the fall-out from Kevin Pietersen's demise as captain, distractions of the  or the lack of a management structure. They need to start pulling in the same direction.
