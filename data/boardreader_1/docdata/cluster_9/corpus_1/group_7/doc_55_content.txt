Flying back from Tampa to LaGuardia this morning, I remember something Michael Kay had said the other day when he flew over Citi Field and Shea Stadium:  Shea Stadium is almost gone!  I know this isn't news, but it's amazing to see it from the air. Citi Field, by the way, looks great. I still wish the taxpayers weren't paying to have the Citibank name all over the stadium, but other than that it looks like it's going to be a terrific stadium.  If I had thought of it, I would have videotaped it! But i didn't think of it. Would the FAA even allow that? I don't know.  I also got a view of new/old Yankee Stadiums from afar. Couldn't really tell much. But the plane did fly right over the Nassau Coliseum, which I don't remember ever happening. Is that a normal flight pattern?  By the way, this is not a sportswriter travel story, because I am in no way whining about anything.
