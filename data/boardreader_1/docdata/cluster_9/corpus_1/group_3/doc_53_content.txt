A vulnerability in the fuel tanks of RAF aircraft had concerned military commanders since the Second World War, an inquest heard.Enemy fire in Iraq pierced a fuel tank in the wing of a Hercules C130K aircraft, which exploded, blowing off the wing. It crashed killing ten servicemen.Nine RAF personnel, including the pilot Flight Lieutenant David Stead, 35, of Burley-in-Wharfedale, and a soldier died on January 30, 2005.Despite prior recommendations, the hearing was told the plane was not fitted with explosion-suppressant foam (ESF), which prevents fuel tanks exploding if they are hit.American Hercules planes have had ESF since the 1960s and Australian ones also have it.A 1971 military research document disclosed today by Wiltshire Coroner David Masters says the risk of fuel tanks exploding if hit by enemy fire had been looked into for 30 years, as far back as World War Two.A January 2002 report by the UK Tactical Analysis Team (TAT) recommending ESF be fitted in Hercules wing tanks was distributed, the inquest heard. A second TAT report in March 2003 said the recommendations still applied.Today a squadron leader in charge of RAF Hercules C130K upgrades in 2002 and 2003, known as EJ, said his commanding officer, a Group Captain at Air Commands HQ 2 Group, did not pass on this information to him. EJ said he wished he had been told because at the time  three years before the tragedy  the Ministry of Defence was making available funds with no defined limit for safety features like this.He added: We struggled to get documentation through that particular group captain. There were other group captains in the building who would help us get around that particular blockage.Mr Masters said: If true, that is extraordinary.EJ said said he was in charge of the Hercules integrated project team and there were grave concerns about the airworthiness of the ageing aircrafts wings.Many of the C130s wings were coming to the end of their intended life-spans, but with funding not available for wing replacements, a wing swapping programme was started in 2002.The Hercules which crashed was due to have its wings replaced when it returned from the Gulf, EJ said.After the tragedy, the Ministry of Defence pledged to fit all RAF Hercules with ESF.Editor's choiceThree teenage girls who were victims of paedophile Philip Davey have spoken out about their ordeals.The Bradford &amp;amp; Bingleys interim communications manager has spoken of his devastation after his brother was killed when he tried to break up a gang attack in the street.Campaigners have won a battle to prevent a catering business opening.Bradford pupils are to make a appearance alongside top chef Jamie Oliver in his new TV series Jamies Ministry of Food which started last night.The Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley name will live on in the UKs high streets  at least for a while yet.Shares in Halifax Bank of Scotland closed 21% higher amid hopes a rescue takeover by Lloyds TSB will go ahead as planned.Police have charged a 21-year-old man with assaulting the cousin of a banker who died following a city centre brawl.Chris Brandon is out of Citys plans until JANUARY after going under the knife for corrective ankle surgery.Semi Tadulala is hoping to fly the flag for Fiji in the World Cup and help rid corruption from the game in his home nation.
