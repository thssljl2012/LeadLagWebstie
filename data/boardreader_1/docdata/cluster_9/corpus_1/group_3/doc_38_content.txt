If bonfires and fireworks are not for you this November, the Merely Divas can offer you an alternative.Following their successful debut in July they are ready to perform once again on Saturday 1 November at St. Mary's Church Long Stratton.The Merely Divas feature the combined singing talents of Lisa Adamson, Sally Arnold, Kate Dann, Pippa King and Karen Stephenson under the musical direction of Michael Dann.Thanks to the huge support of Barclays Bank agreeing to match pound for pound to money raised (thanks to Lisa's involvement as a Barclays employee) the group raised 1400 for Cancer Research UK from their first show.This time the Merely Divas will be raising money for the East Anglian Air Ambulance after friend of the Merely Divas, David Gardiner, (66) fell 15 feet out of a tree he was helping a friend to pull down and needed the services of the Air Ambulance to rush him from near his Long Stratton home to the A &amp;amp; E department of the Norfolk &amp;amp; Norwich University Hospital.David has made an amazing recovery and he suggested the concert by the Merely Divas to say thanks to the service.Musical director Michael Dann said We're pleased to have been asked to stage this show for such a great cause and can promise the audience an evening full of wonderful show songs sung by a talented group of Divas!The concert will take place at St Mary's Church Long Stratton on Saturday 1 November at 7:30pm.
