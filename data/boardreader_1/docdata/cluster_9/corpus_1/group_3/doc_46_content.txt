MARRIED life began on the wrong foot for North Queensland enforcer Carl Webb, who was allegedly caught drink-driving the morning after his wedding as he was on his way to clean up the reception hall. Webb left the Jupiters Hotel early on Saturday morning to help clean the site when he was pulled over at 6.50am by Townsville police, and blew more than twice the legal limit, 0.121. 'I wish to apologise to everyone involved at the Cowboys including our sponsors and fans for putting myself in this situation,' Webb said in a statement last night. 'In no way do I condone drink-driving and I have learnt a valuable lesson. In hindsight I should have had someone else drive the car back to the reception location for the clean up.' The 27-year-old was served with a notice to appear at Townsville Magistrates Court on November 27 - we're not sure if he must rearrange his honeymoon plans. Webb did attend the Cowboys' presentation night with new wife Renee that same evening.Layne Beachley will attempt to win her own contest when the Beachley Classic resumes at Manly today - but only after the Commonwealth Bank stepped in at the 11th hour to kick in $60,000 to sponsor the event. It was sure not to be lost on those at Billabong, whom Beachley brushed as her personal sponsor a few years ago on principle. As documented in her new autobiography, she effectively told the surfwear giant to jam it because she didn't believe it was giving women's surfing enough recognition. It was something Billabong's US marketing director Graham Stapelberg took great delight in pointing out after she clinched her seventh world title in 2006. 'You so blew it!' he exclaimed.
