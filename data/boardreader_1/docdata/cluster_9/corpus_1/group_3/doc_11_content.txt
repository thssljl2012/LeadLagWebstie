World No. 3 Vijay Singh is expected to be sidelined for at least two months because of an arm injury. &gt;Tendinitis in Singh's left forearm has ruled him out of the Iskandar Johor Open in Malaysia from October 30-November 2 and the Champions Tournament in Shanghai from November 6-9. 'I am very disappointed to miss the Iskandar Johor Open and the HSBC event as I was looking forward to returning to Asia,' the 45-year-old Singh said in a news release issued by the Asian Tour on Tuesday. 'As disappointing as it will be to miss the tournaments it is important I follow my doctor's instructions and do what is best for my long-term health.' Singh, of Fiji, has won three times on the PGA Tour this year, including the Barclays Classic in August and this month's Deutsche Bank Championship which helped him clinch victory in the FedExCup playoff series. 'We are obviously very disappointed but I understand from his manager that his injury is serious and will need two months of rest,' said Iskandar Johor Open organizing committee chairman Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman.
