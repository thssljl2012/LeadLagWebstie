STEVE BENNETT is in no doubt refereeing is a career with excellent prospects.When Bennett first ventured on to his local parks as an affiliated referee with the Sidcup and District League he could not have dreamed a hobby would develop into a highly-paid, full-time job.As one of the Barclays Premier League's most experienced officials, Bennett can testify to the rewards available where the job pays more than 1,000 a match.He is quick to stress that love of the game, rather than lucrative rewards, was influential in him first picking up the whistle.'If you're thinking about taking up refereeing then go for it,' he said. 'Believe you can make a difference and find a league that looks after its referees.'Becoming a referee has been made easier by the Kent County Football Association's appointment of John Newson as their first Referee Development Officer.A call to him on 01634 843824 will set any applicant on the road to becoming a referee.'The biggest percentage of people taking up refereeing do so because they want to do it purely as a hobby,' said Mr Newson. 'At first they are put on a 15-hour course which is broken down to two and a half hours a week.'At the end of the course, entrants sit an exam on the laws of the game. Once they have passed that exam and taken charge of six games, under the guidance of a mentor, they are invited to a call-back session under the auspices of the KCFA.'Once they are presented with their FA certificate and badge we put them in touch with their local branch of the Kent Referees' Association.'Mr Newson is convinced the introduction of mentors has been of enormous benefit.'Two or three years ago there were no mentors for the new referee to fall back on,' he added. 'Now they are readily available.'Kent, like any other county, cannot have too many referees. The present number is 11,071, with a further 143 people on courses.'After a lot of work, the retention levels are improving,' said Mr Newson. 'What's more we're succeeding in tempting back referees who turned their backs on the game.'
