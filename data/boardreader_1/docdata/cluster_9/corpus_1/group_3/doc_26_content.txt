A motorist who parked illegally for 20 years while popping to the bank is to appeal against a parking ticket. Mark Sycamore has parked in an unmarked bay by recycling bins in St Christopher Road, St Johns, Colchester, for 15 to 20 years while he nips into Barclays bank. Now, after getting a ticket, he wants to warn others who stop in the same place. Mr Sycamore, of Compton Road, Colchester, said there is no bay marked and no signs to warn of a fine. Richard Walker, parking service manager at Colchester Council, said the offence was like parking in a bus stop and it warranted an instant ticket. He added: We have re-marked the bays where you can park and made it more obvious.
