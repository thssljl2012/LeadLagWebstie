Most of us live at our desks 40 hours a week, if not more. So of course you want to make your cubicle more personal. Just don't go too far. Heather Kauffman, 33, recruitment specialist at CDS Global gave us some guidelines on what you should and shouldn't display in a professional environment. - Sophia Ahmad1. MAKE IT PERSONAL, BUT MAKE IT APPROPRIATE. If you spent the weekend at the lake, you can have a picture of you on your desk. Just don't have a risque shot of yourself doing things you wouldn't want your CEO to see. 'Keep your items clean and tasteful,' Kauffman said. An inappropriate picture strips away professionalism, something you work really hard all week to build up.2. STAY AWAY FROM POLITICS AND RELIGION. In general, these are sensitive subjects and paraphernalia should be avoided. 'It could be offensive and distracting to other co-workers,' Kauffman said.3. REMEMBER, YOU'RE AN ADULT. You know that teddy bear collection you're so proud of? Be proud of it in the privacy of your own home. 'It seems really cute to bring that stuff in. And it may be cute, but it can be juvenile. In a professional world, it may undermine your credibility,' she said.4. IF IN QUESTION, DON'T DISPLAY IT. Enough said. Respect yourself and respect others with what you have in your space.5. YOU CAN STILL BE FUN. Kauffman herself livens up her desk with a rainbow Koosh ball and a Koziol tape dispenser (the tape is a hula hoop around a guy). But, don't go too over the top, and keep everything neat and orderly.Roberta Picciurro, 33, right, had wax lips, a yo-yo, giant green foam finger, giant star-shaped sunglasses and three salt shakers on her desk at her last job.'No, I did not work for a children's center,' she said. 'I worked for Allied/Nationwide Insurance.'Her company's bosses did not appreciate all the crazy stuff on her and her co-workers' desks. 'But we always kept it there because it was fun and added flair to our working environment,' she said.
