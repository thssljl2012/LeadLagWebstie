        QUOTE (BillsFan74 &#064; Jan 17 2009, 08:22 AM)       I wish everybody would take a minute before posting these rumors. First of all Oakland or Jacksonville would move to LA before the Bills.Jacksonville is the most likely tram to move in the league right now, they make no monay and have little fan support. Second everyone is oversensitive about Toronto it is a long shot to move an NFL team into Canada. There are a tone of hurdles with the CBA, Labor Law, and the CFL. I don't think the Bills are moving anytime soon. Plus LA did not support the NFL the last time teams were there.     LA is possibly the worst football market in the country, considering how many people live in the area and how poorly supported their teams have been over history....
