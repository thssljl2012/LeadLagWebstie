Misses uncontested layups, not athletic, terrible turnovers, terrible fouls, no jumper, zero offensive skill.  Two inches shorter and he's not getting into a CBA game, second-to-last guy picked in a junior high pick-up game.    he isnt a great offenisive player by any means   he is shooting .426% which is better than all these players   Chanlder  .422% Al har      .418% Duhon     .417% T Thomas .414% Qrich      .387% Roberson .379%
