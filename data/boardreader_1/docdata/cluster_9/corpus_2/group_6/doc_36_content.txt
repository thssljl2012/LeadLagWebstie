                                      &amp;quot;It then ends with the date 1/18/09. A source close to James has told me that on January 18 at the US Bank Arena in Cincinnati Ohio, Lil Wayne will be performing. As you know Lil Wayne was recently featured in Jame's Nike Chalk commercial. On January 18 2009, Lebron will be featured in Lil Wayne's tour as he releases his much anticipated and true love rap single on stage. As the commercial says, Brace Yourself.&amp;quot;
