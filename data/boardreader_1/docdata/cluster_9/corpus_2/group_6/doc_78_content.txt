I disagree about the Raps having all the power. The player usually has the most power since the CBA has been drafted. In the past, the team had all the control, but not anymore. We all should know that with the Tmac fiasco, not to mention Shaq as well. The Raps would be stupid to let Bosh walk for nothing without at least getting a bunch of picks for their trouble. Bosh would have his choice, but from a small select of teams, not just one in particular. With that said, it would probably take Shard to get it done given the amount Bosh is going to command. Its possible that a package could be done without him involved, but not very likely. I would definitely trade Shard for him though. There aren't many that I would, but Bosh is a sure fire example of one. Sadly, its a dream that isn't going to come true however.
