Luckily the one and only major bill is paid up ahead.      If things go right I might be working with my father hauling wood (short logs) with my truck but that's still not going to be a constant thing, and the trailer that I'll be using still needs work.   .                      I took a quick look at jobs in your area, yikes theres nothing.!      But if you have a truck you can do garbage dump hauling for people or basement cleanouts, demo work , place an ad in the supermkts and craigslist.   The work might be dirty but the money's clean.!   Sometimes you have to create your own job.      I'm in catering, its almost as bad as the boat biz right now so I started baking wholesale and delivering to cafes and coffee shops, I don't care for waking up at 2:30am but its work...thankfully I have the skill to do it.      My wife was laid off by bank of America, she's collecting and taking advantage of the training programs during unemployment, she taking nurses aid , it pays quite well and the course is only 2 months.      Keep sluggin.
