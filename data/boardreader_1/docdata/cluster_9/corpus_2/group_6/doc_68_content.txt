 minnesota broke the league rules / cba in the joe smith case. they got a punishment. nothing else was &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; in that case.      it's entirely possible what the blazers did was &amp;quot;more wrong&amp;quot; than that, but if they didn't break any rules / cba, it will be quite difficult to punish them.      and the threat was about someone trying to screw the blazers by playing miles. not about playing miles because he produces on the court. if miles can actually play, good for him and the grizzlies.
