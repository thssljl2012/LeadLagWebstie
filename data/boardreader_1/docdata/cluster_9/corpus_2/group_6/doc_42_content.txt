It's a given that a clothy BW should lose to a WE.  But combat logs show ALL damage in this game, not just what you actually did.  You know &amp;quot;XXX (XXX mitigated)&amp;quot;.  Those #'s combined are total damage.  It doesn't matter if it's  900(100) or 100(900), it still shows 1k damage in that example.     As for BW matching this DPS, no way unless there's morales involved, maybe a lucky flashfire, &amp;amp; the target has absolutely crap resists.     Remember, the SS I showed only had 4 crits out of 36 attacks &amp;amp; not a single morale was used.  And again, those WE's are not even in the top 50 on my server.     The best BW on our server is Sealdadeal, &amp;amp; I'd bet he averages about 3/4th's the DPS of just an average WE.  Probably somewhere in the 700-800 range.  But he has amazing gear, is RR65, &amp;amp; is 18 incin 10 immo with WH, nova, FBB, &amp;amp; FP.  I'm sure his WH will ocassionally get lucky &amp;amp; tripple crit for 1100/each tick, but if his target has even as much as 500 corp resist, it's knocked down to ~800ish.  AND he has to cast boiling blood FIRST for that to even be possible.     Do WE's blow themselves up for 1k damage every time they dish out 3k?  I don't think so.     There is no comparison here, just face it.                      First you talk about potential damage and then you start talking about resisted damage. Nice bias there, eh?    A decent BW will have at the very least 60% crit, so Boiling Blood+Triple crit WH isn't exactly uncommon. Let's say Ignite crits for 550, Boiling Blood for 400 and WH for 1450 (highest WH tick on me has been 1563 before resistances, by Evul on KA), as you know, we're talking about potential damage here. Ignite is 183 dps, Boiling Blood is 133 DPS and WH is 700 dps. Funnel Power adds another 150 to the initial WH, making it a total of 725 dps. Nova crits for another 2000. Funnel Power adds another 150.    This is not even taking into account AoE damage, which BW's have an entire tree for.    I cba to calc the overall DPS with 60% crit chance (a BW with great gear+high renown rank will have closer to 65%-70%), but it's pretty damn close to 1000+ over the 10 seconds. Fireball Barrage will probably add more dps than WH will, but I'm not entirely sure about that,    This won't be true against stacked resistances, but your WE example won't be true against detaunts, CC, kiting and armor, either. Talking about potential damage is retarded in the first place.      WE with equal gear to this 60% crit BW will have around 25%-30% chance to crit a target, which brings the WE above the BW in burst dps, which is how it's supposed to be.    Do BW's have to be in melee range to do damage?     See what I did there?    There is indeed a retarded comparison here. WE's have to deal more burst DPS and maybe total DPS than BW's/sorcs, why'd you bring a WE over a Sorc if they didn't? As I said before, talking about potential damage is retarded in the first place. This is not a &amp;quot;NERF BW!&amp;quot; post, or a post that says that resist stacking is fine. It's in fact, quite a retarded post, just to show your bias.
