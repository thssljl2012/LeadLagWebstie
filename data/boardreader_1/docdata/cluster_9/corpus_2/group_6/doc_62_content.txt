It may be uncapped but not unregulated. Teams finishing in the top 10 of the league will not be allowed to sign new FAs until they've already lost one of their previous players. Plus anyone that gives out stupid contracts will have to honour them when the new CBA hits, and therefore be relegated to cap hell.
