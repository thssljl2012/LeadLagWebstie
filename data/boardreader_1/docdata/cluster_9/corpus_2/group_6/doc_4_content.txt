Honestly, I can't even read the part from the CBA.  From what you wrote, though, if the roster bonus I referred to was treated as a signing bonus that would be fine.  In fact, forget my roster bonus and make it a signing bonus of $10M or so with a minimum salary year one - that gets him his money immediately as opposed to 17 installments.  That's all I was saying.
