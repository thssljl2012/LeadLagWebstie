From what you wrote, though, if the roster bonus I referred to was treated as a signing bonus that would be fine.  In fact, forget my roster bonus and make it a signing bonus of $10M or so with a minimum salary year one - that gets him his money immediately as opposed to 17 installments.  That's all I was saying.                         Because of the 30% rule, his 2010 salary can not be more than 130% of his 2009 salary. The minimum 2009 salary for a player with Cassel's experience is $620,000. 30% of $620,000 is $186,000. That means his 2010 salary can be no more than $806,000.      Your deal gives Cassel less money in two years than signing the franchise tender immediately.
