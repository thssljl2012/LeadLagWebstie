And yes it does seem that a lot of things happen in Florida, California and Texas but those are states are heavily populated so I guess that makes sense.  Michigan seems to have a lot of profiles, too.                           I was wondering what UM stories happened in MN myself---I have a friend from Albert Lea and we got to talking about it, and I honestly couldn't think of any! (I'd forgotten the bank robbery.) I chalked it up to the Minnesota Nice thing.
