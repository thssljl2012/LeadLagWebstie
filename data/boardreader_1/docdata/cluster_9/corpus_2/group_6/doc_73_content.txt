 I'm not a big gambler, but I do take my mother to the casinos from time to time. Belterra is the nicest of the ones near Cincinnati, but also the most distant from downtown. Argosy is closest but IMHO not very nice -- and really hard to take if you're a non-smoker as it is by far the smokiest. Grand Victoria is nicer than the Argosy and closer than the Belterra. That's usually where I end up taking my mother.             I know the Cincinnati Cyclones hockey team has a game this Saturday night at US Bank Arena downtown. Not really a relaxing event, but the games are pretty fun and tickets are cheap.
