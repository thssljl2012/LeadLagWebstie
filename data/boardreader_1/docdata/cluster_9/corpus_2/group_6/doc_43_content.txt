It's horrible the way that teams are completely screwed when a player with a big contract gets hurt.   The CBA doesn't force owners into longer, bigger, or guaranteed contracts.  The purpose the CBA serves is to make contracts smaller and shorter.  The owners can only ask players to screw themselves so much before they say we don't need a union or a collective bargaining agreement.  Then, if the owners want to give up their franchises and league, the players can start their own.  Nobody is paying money to watch the owners.
