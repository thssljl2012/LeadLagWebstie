I doubt the Sixers would come out stating to have opened this account if they actually hadn't, or that they had shown him the amount deposited when they hadn't.   HAHAH do me a favour Customer. Go to your CBA branch, go the front counter and ask to open an account please in the name of Julius Hodge. See how far you get. After working at the CBA for 4 years and now another Bank I can assure you opening an account is more difficult than getting a 500k mortgage. You need 100pts id, photo ID, signatures, address verified etc. So thats your challenge my friend, go to a branch and open an account in the name of Julius Hodge. Once opened PM me the account number   Idiot. I said &amp;quot;opened an account using anyone's name&amp;quot;. Did I say go use &amp;quot;Julius Hodge&amp;quot; as the name? You are constantly exposing yourself as a spoonhead.
