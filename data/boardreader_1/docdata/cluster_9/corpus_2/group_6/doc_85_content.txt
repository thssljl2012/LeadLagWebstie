 Re what to bring back, as we moved back to the UK from Texas, one thing we found useful was getting mains transformers so we could use inexpensive US electricals back in the UK.     We have things like a HiFi, slow cookers, a Kitchen Aid (far cheaper in the US) via the transformers.     OTC products are far cheaper over there, as Rachiie said.     If you want Montreal Salt with your steaks, they've stopped selling it here. We did get some brought back over for Christmas!     Spare bed linen for US sized beds, especially the very large ones (my wife came up with that one!)     If you intending to holiday back in the US consider keeping a US bank account open, as we do.     Good luck!
