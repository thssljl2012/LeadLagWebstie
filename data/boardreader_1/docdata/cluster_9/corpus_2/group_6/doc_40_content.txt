        QUOTE (foxtail &#064; Jan 26 2009, 09:32 AM)       Tied up with ANZ as a business?... mmmm strange, maybe they just bank roll Belikin in OZ?.     Not sure .... I think it has something to do with call center based support (ie: an ANZ owned business is the call center that is them outsourced to by a number of electronics based suppliers/retailers)
