It's amazing how both the local and the visiting fans at the Bank of America stadium are a lot more civilized than fans at the RBC Center.    This is one of the turn-offs for me. There are too many stupid drunk rednecks who flock to hockey games, probably in the hope of seeing some fist fights on the ice, and of starting some on the stands.    I find Buffalo fans to be particularly obnoxious.     For sale, cheap: an NFL coach (Fox) and a QB (Delhomme)
