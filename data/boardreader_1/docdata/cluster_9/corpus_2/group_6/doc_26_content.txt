Might be a longshot but I thought I'd see if anyone was interested here first    Long story short, I have 2 tickets to the Eagles at Hampden park on the 4th of July 2009 in block AA4         AA4 is basicly at the stage, sorry for crappy pic but AA4 is the third blue one from the left, front row.    Bought from SECxtra for 90 each and I'm not looking to sell them on for a profit or anything, cba with Ebay unless I have to, so basicly just need the money back for them.  Ticketmaster want the same if not more for seats on the south stand!    Anyone interested?
