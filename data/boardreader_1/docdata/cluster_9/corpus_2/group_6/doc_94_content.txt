Jan. 16--NEW YORK -- Mike Barnhardt of Huntersville was in a business meeting and figured his wife was just calling to say her flight was late.      When he picked up Vicki's voicemail message 15 minutes later, he heard this: "We're crashing. This is it. I just want to tell you I love you, I love the kids, I love you, I love you, I love you."      His reaction, he said, "was nothing you would want anyone else to hear."      "That's it, I'm a single parent," he thought. "Half your life is gone in one fell swoop. It's not something you wish on your worst enemy."      He frantically tried to get information on his Blackberry and told his boss that Vicki's plane had crashed. He headed to pick up his 8-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son.      About 30 minutes later, he got another call from a number he didn't recognize. This time she was on a rescue ferry and telling him she was OK. He felt "utmost relief."      Barnhardt talked to reporters Friday at the hotel where many of the crash victims were taken after they were rescued. He flew in from Charlotte on Thursday night after the crash, and the couple planned to fly home again Friday.      Barnhardt said Vicki, 38, an independent contractor who does trainings for clients such as Bank of America and Wachovia, was visiting a new customer in New York. She had been seated in the rear of the plane when it went down, and was one of the last people off the flight.      When she stepped out onto the wing of the plane, she slipped off and was submerged in the freezing Hudson River. But she got plucked out and was fine.      Still chilled, tired and sore, Barnhardt said she wasn't ready to face the press.      "Obviously you still reflect on it and you get emotional about it. You start to grasp what happened," he said of how the pair were feeling Friday.      He credits a "higher hand" and the skilled pilot.      Her terrifying voicemail is gone.      "Just as an instinct, I erased it," he said. "It's not something you want to hear again. It's just nauseating to hear something like that, I'm glad I erased it."            (eff'in aye....  )
