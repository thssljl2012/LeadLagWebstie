Bettman actually supports contraction/relocation in the right environment.        The 30 people he works for do not, hence it is not an option.  In fact, the owners (and NHLPA) are against contraction, against relocation (deprives the owners of an expansion team), and all for expansion.  Bettman is best advised to pay attention and follow suit whether he agrees with them or not.      In order for a team to contract, the NHL&amp;#039;s governing articles (which as a private corporate entity don&amp;#039;t need to be made public) state that the rest of the owners have to buy it equally at the going rate for a franchise ($300-$350MM right now).  This means that 29 owners would have to agree to buy out the 30th at a rate of $10MM to $12MM per owner.  Under the current CBA, only a handful of teams have to pay close to that as part of the revenue sharing agreement.  Since the owners for the most part are cheap bastards, contraction is an unlikely  route.      As one of the posters above me has stated, the NHLPA would also have an issue with the loss of 23 job opportunities.  Most would get contracts somewhere - be it Europe or a minor league - but only players on NHL rosters get league benefits.            In order for the quality of play to improve significantly, the number of teams contracted would have to be several.
