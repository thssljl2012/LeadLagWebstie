both seymour and brady deals can be redone....in fact, even the moss deal can be made more cap friendly.........I doubt jarvis green's roster bonus will come to fruition as they will probably rework his deal, also......      the pats can cover much of the 1 year hit keeping cassel would cost by creating additional guarantees and pushing costs out for a year although it could come back to bite them should the CBA not get done
