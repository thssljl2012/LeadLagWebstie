 RAFFLE   Item Title  : Photoshop Sketches   Item Description  : I'll whip something up of your choice on Photoshop. Some references would be great if it's fan art or whatever. I can also do pairings, but not too intimate, haha. Sketches can be seen in the second post,  here . Sketches are sketches, so dun expect polished up works. At most, if you like it, I'll line it and you get to colour it or whatever you want to do with it then.   Suggested Price  : 300   Quantity  : 3  AUCTION   Item Title  : Artwork   Item Description  : Basically a full out drawing with colour and everything. Two characters max plus background. I'd prefer one, though &amp;gt;w&amp;gt;. References would be great if you have something in mind. You can choose what medium I work in, although it's advisable if you choose something I'm good at xD. Art can be seen  here .  I'd think about slaving myself this year, but I cba'd =w=.
