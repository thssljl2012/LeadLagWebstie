NHL Tenants?  The last team in Winnipeg was the Jets.    The MTS Centre is usually seen as much too small and would require a significant increase to the seating capacity and significant cost. It's current capacity is 15,015 and the potential ownership including Manitoba Moose owner Mark Chipman has stated that it is in fact not too small and could be renovated. Talks were sparked when Commissioner Gary Bettman stated "Under the current CBA..I think an NHL franchise could work in Winnipeg".     "...cinema is truth 24 times a second."
