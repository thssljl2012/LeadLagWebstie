Awww. I hope you both feel better soon!!!       That is awesome that you can do all that! Awww.. you make your bros pajamas.. how cute!! I wanna see pictures         I can scrapbook!   Those are my craft skills..lol!       I know the last month or so before my husband deployed, we were distance and we verbally fought a lot. Mostly due to me, actually, not knowing what exactly I was feeling until after he left. There are just so many different emotions/thoughts/feelings that go into deployments. They suck, but the good news is they will be over   If you ever need anything, I am here.   You can always PM me            About the job..   It was more so an open house for US Bank's banker positions. They are opening 23 in store (inside a grocery store. Smith's) branches and looking for bankers and branch managers to hire and train before they open the stores. They are scheduled to open on Jan 26th.       So the district manager for region that I wanted to work for, let me know that there were going to be doing more formal interviews next week and the week after, so they'd give me call.       But I am bummed because they had around 50-75 people there. Although they're were three different districts.. so *crosses fingers* that they'll call me back.       I also had Wells Fargo email me to set up an interview, but by the time I called them back they had the appointments all filled   But I am trying TGIFriday's.. not sure if your familar with that restuarant or not. They have tasty food         I also tried on base here in Vegas.. so we shall see what happens. I am trying whereever I can.. pretty much.       I also tried macysjobs.com and I received an email they wanted an interview with me, but then they to don't have any available appointments right now, so I have to check back regularly.    URGH.. job hunting sucks!!..       Sorry this is so long and detailed. Hope you get better soon! And I hope your DH gets better soon as well! Enjoy the time you to have together!!
