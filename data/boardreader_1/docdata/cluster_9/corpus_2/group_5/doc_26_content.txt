That deal doesn&amp;#039;t work in the trade checker right now.  Deng&amp;#039;s BYC makes things difficult.  The best deal Cliff Levingston could come up with was Hinrich, Deng, Gooden, Noah and our &amp;#039;09 1st rounder for Amare and Diaw.   Cliff Levingston wouldn&amp;#039;t expect the Suns to accept the deal, but it provides:  - A great backup and competent replacement for Nash in Hinrich, who can also swing the 2 for some stretches. - A good, still young 3 in Deng. - A competent but inconsistent PF in Gooden. - A young big man prospect in Noah. - A first round pick that could end up being pretty good.  Once again, it doesn&amp;#039;t make Phoenix a better team right now nor does it really help them &amp;amp;quot;rebuild&amp;amp;quot; per se unless you consider Hinrich/Deng/Noah a better basis on which to rebuild than Amare, but it&amp;#039;s the best the Bulls could offer under the current constrictions of the CBA.  Come next offseason though, it gets a little easier since Deng&amp;#039;s BYC would be lifted.
