You know of all the things these journos could write about &amp;quot;MLS lacking&amp;quot; i find this piece to be really stupid.     Where is the critical analyisis of the ultra flawed academy policy, or the ex pose on the monopolistic single entity on player salalry surpression, or the big issues suurounding the next CBA discussion.     Where are the articles slamming MLS on their appraoch to increasing player quality, or the effect of the economic crisis on MLS's expansion plans and business.      So many stories to go for of substance that this piece (IMO one that isnt even true) just hits about as hard an meaningful as a Steve Eurkel left hook.     Blah.
