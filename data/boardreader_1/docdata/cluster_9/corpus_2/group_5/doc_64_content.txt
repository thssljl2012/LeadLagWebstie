Just know this, in 2010  we're going to see an ABSURD, never before, record breaking contract nba contract deal for this   guy. Think A-Rod numbers x 1.5 or 2 (a-rod currently makes 27 mill a year ).              Inevitably, that's what's going to happen, and  CLEVELAND WILL NOT  have the money for that. Say hello to New York.   I guess you've never heard of the Min/Max Salary restrictions in the NBA's CBA?        A guy with 10+ years of service wouldn't make &amp;quot;A-Rod numbers&amp;quot; let alone someone with 7 years of service like Lebron will have in 2010.        Oh yeah, and if he were to sign the extension...the city of New York would be on Suicide Watch.
