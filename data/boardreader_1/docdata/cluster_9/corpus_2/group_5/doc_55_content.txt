That&amp;#039;s a level 3 artifact + a level 2 artifact. You&amp;#039;d only need to spend 1 bonus point on the warstrider, liege, and oblivion&amp;#039;s panoply, as opposed to 4 bonus points to get the CBA.        Of course, according to the abyssals book, panoply on CBA is IMPOSSIBLE, but whatever.            EDIT: holy shit I just realized bonestriders could bear Panoply of Oblivion, and even a mere mortal or dragon blooded can make it (it takes fucking forever, but hey). So yeah, for just liege 3, artifact 2, you can get better than CBA, if you have a daybreak crafter type in your party.                The issue is that warstriders must be upkept, and have higher requirements in terms of commitment, fatigue, and mobility penalties.        And you are buying two things &amp;amp;#8211; an warstrider and plating.        Whereas with CBA, you&amp;#039;re buying CBA, then getting various extras with it. _________________ Saying &amp;quot;This must be the way it is&amp;quot; is likely to make me question your point and show its weaknesses. This doesn&amp;#039;t mean I actually agree with you.        #exalted IRC channel on irc.wetfish.net     It&amp;#039;s interesting.        Site for my  charms coming soon
