We may or may not have a new scheme, but either way I'm sure some things will change.                         I'm actually more excited to see what transpires on the defensive side of the ball.      Gruden's gonna get a pass regardless.  Malcolm's boys are going to stand pat for now &amp;amp; wait to see what implications may, or may not occur following our new president taking office (not to take this political... Sorry)...      Wayne H. dumped his majority share of the Phins in a whirlwind deal largely due to the same possible ramifications.  The Glazers aren't in any position to do that.  Now.      I will be FAR more down on ownership if they leave a ton of cap space (CBA not withstanding) and don't re-up those who deserve it, and part ways with those who not longer have game, and either    draft a top 5 QB and develop him    or sign a decent UFA QB soon to be named (Under 30).      &amp;quot;The Times They are a Changin'...&amp;quot;            As far as the OP:      Think about how closely what the original basis of the WCO is all about and Gruden might be 'pulling it off' with precision...!

He could not read defenses, and generally   wasnt able to throw the ball more than 20 yards down field   without resorting to something that looked like a shot put.    His only upside was that he had decent accuracy with short passes.          And........         We couldnt dominate anyone with the run, so Virgil became our central performer... And thats how it all started. When I was forced to use Virgil.*                       Here's the rub.....      Gruden wasn't forced to use Garthia and we clearly the see the results of the decision:  Mediocrity.
