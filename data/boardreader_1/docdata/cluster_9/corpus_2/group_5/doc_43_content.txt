none of the cba teams have changed thier schedule yet as i think they know announcing the ABA teams prematurely will open them to more criticism.  At least I know the WV Wild (no website, no mention on the ABA website...???) is our first scheduled home games (after an opening road game in Owensboro KY versus the Kentucky Bisons) thanks to the Miners press release and I was optimisitic that Lawton was onboard for the interleague games but PRoy says no and he typically is on the money.      I&amp;#039;m onboard for this year but i truly wish we had just added in a couple teams to fill the voids instead of this partnership.
