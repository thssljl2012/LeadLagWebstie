 IndiaMike.com My Jaipur tuk-tuk driver/guide (in 2004) is a very nice Muslim man who's turned his life around: he quit drinking, married, and has fathered five adorable children. (I was invited to his house for a home-cooked dinner.)      I'd like to send him monetary gifts from time to time. Earlier this year I sent him a Bank of America certified cheque. He couldn't cash it (and returned it to me). U S Postal orders are invalid in India. Short of stuffing cash into an envelope, how can I get something to him?
