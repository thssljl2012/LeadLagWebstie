    Forgotten cash becomes thrift shop booty  &amp;amp;nbsp;    Posted: Dec. 7, 2008       &amp;amp;nbsp; enlarge photo     Rick Wood  If the owner of cash found in a pair of resale shop boots does not come forward, Rick and Dimitra Anderson plan to donate it to charity.          more photos    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp; Rick Wood  If the owner of cash found in a pair of resale shop boots does not come forward, Rick and Dimitra Anderson plan to donate it to charity.   Close        There&amp;#039;s a lesson here to anyone who hides money around the house - stuffed in a pair of boots, for instance.  You might forget it&amp;#039;s there, or perhaps you won&amp;#039;t live long enough to spend or deposit it. And the money gets thrown away or donated to a resale shop by relatives who should have poked inside boots, pockets, mattresses or whatever.  Dimitra Anderson walked into a resale shop here last week and spotted a pair of boots she liked. She pushed her foot into the right one but felt a blockage. So she reached in with her hand.  Inside the boot was a sock. And inside the sock was a bank envelope. And inside the bank envelope was a stack of cash.  She bought the boots for $3 and did not mention the surprise contents to the clerk. It&amp;#039;s not really the store&amp;#039;s money once the boots were put out for sale, right?  &amp;quot;I got so scared. I went home and called Rick,&amp;quot; she said.  Rick, Dimitra&amp;#039;s husband and a Milwaukee firefighter, came home from work later, and Dimitra said she had found a rich bank envelope in the other boot, too. He reached deeper into that left boot and found a third envelope she hadn&amp;#039;t noticed. It, too, was filled with dough.  &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re sitting on (here Rick mentioned an impressive dollar amount; I&amp;#039;m not sharing what it is because the Andersons are hoping to find the owner, and that&amp;#039;s easier if you withhold a few details).&amp;quot;  Oftentimes, when people find cash, they either pocket it or they announce the discovery and then hold their breath and hope nobody claims it.  Dimitra and Rick contacted the Journal Sentinel and said they really want to find the owner. If they can&amp;#039;t, they plan to donate the money to charity.  &amp;quot;I knew I wasn&amp;#039;t going to keep it, no matter how much it was. If it&amp;#039;s going to be mine, it&amp;#039;s going to the Rescue Mission or the Humane Society,&amp;quot; Dimitra said.  And to paralyzed veterans, Rick chimed in.  Nice. Especially during the holidays and in these economic tough times, when we&amp;#039;re all more worried about money.  Dimitra, who works part time as a personal trainer and also teaching and performing belly dancing, hits many thrift stores. The Milwaukee couple&amp;#039;s two sons, now 16 and 18, have grown up wearing her bargains. And she&amp;#039;s been known to enter - and even win - pageants in gowns she bought for as little as 50 cents.  Rick is guessing the money they found belonged to an older woman who faithfully tucked it away without telling anyone. Given what&amp;#039;s happening with the stock market, her investment strategy now looks brilliant.  He assumes she died recently and her children or someone else cleared out her house.  In that case, no one else would have any idea how much cash was in those boots or what the boots or socks inside look like. Here&amp;#039;s one clue I will share: The bills were in three rather tattered envelopes, one from First Wisconsin, one from Firstar Bank and one from U.S. Bank - the same institution under its different names over the years.  There is a bit of printing on the envelopes and a name written on one bill, though anyone could have done that. Just in case, the Andersons went online and tried to find a recent death notice for anyone with that name. None was found.  If this really and truly sounds like your money, let me know.  As for the boots, Dimitra is thinking of donating them to a resale shop. They&amp;#039;re not her size, and they make a lousy safety deposit box.
