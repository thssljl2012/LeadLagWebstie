Yeah MADD is worth 2 flops and MUL 1 - but theres differing reports on the actually setup on G92* and I cba getting my head around it - if I'm wrong I erred on the lower side so if I am wrong that would make the 9600GT faster in worst case...      You can't put hard and fast figures to the efficency of MADD/Complex - generally it does pretty well but undeniably there are times when it drops well below the level of 160*4*2*clockspeed even...      *Some places say 312GFLOPS (which would make sense with 2+1 and is what my instinct would be) but many sites considered &amp;quot;authoriative&amp;quot; say 208.      EDIT: From a little more reading it appears that they are saying the only way to fairly compare the different architectures performance potential is *2 for the G9x instead of *3.
