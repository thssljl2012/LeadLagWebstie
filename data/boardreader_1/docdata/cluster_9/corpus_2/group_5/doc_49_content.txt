   Might as well. If I missed you I&amp;#039;m sorry, I cba to write too much this morning. ;-;  Thanks to  Deathman48  for always being there for me these past four years. :3 Thanks for being so kind and awesome and sweet and basically the best person ever.   I shall never forget the roundabout of death in Manchester... how we survived that I will never know! Of course you had to live through it though to get your precious chicken sandwich from Burger King. &amp;amp;gt;:[ Oh, and walking up that hill in like 35C weather... it&amp;#039;s not my fault we almost died! You had the power to be like &amp;quot;no I&amp;#039;m not doing that lol&amp;quot; but you didn&amp;#039;t say anything. :L It was even worse carrying the groceries. xD Still makes for good memories though haha!  Thanks to  Harvest Moon Girl  for being such a great friend to me all this time. You made that anime convention two years ago totally awesome. I still have those pictures of us &amp;quot;interacting&amp;quot; with the statues... we have changed so much since then haha! Well, not personality wise at least. 8D Matching Sesame Street shirts ftw! Oh and way to still not send me my birthday present after like two years dhgasdhjjh ;-;  Thanks to  Shane  for basically being super rad and providing me with endless hours of entertainment. :&amp;#039;D I&amp;#039;m sorry I couldn&amp;#039;t go with you and Toni and be all super cool in NY, but we shall have to have an awesome Dublin trip someday! I love how you are so hilarious and do interesting things such as thread guitar strings through your earring holes. You&amp;#039;re great!  Thanks to  Dark Arcanine  for chatting with me for hours during my sleepless painful nights after having my wisdom teeth removed. I&amp;#039;d have been bored stiff without you man, being up at like 4AM after having hardly slept is so not fun. =o  Thanks to  Rome  for being Robe Buddies n junk. :3 We need to talk more!  Thanks to  Shadow993  for being a great friend and also providing me with interesting late night chats. I always love the excuses you have for not going to bed until like past 3AM. I wonder what would happen if you actually got a good nights sleep for once! *gaaaasp*  Kay that&amp;#039;s good enough for now.
