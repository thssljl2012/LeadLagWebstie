Had a C0 for a while but swapped it for a Q6600, temps were safe at 4.0GHz @ 1.34V (cpu-z idle) is all I recall.    With your E0 stepping you could go for 500x8,5 for 4.25GHz. As long as you keep your cpu/core temps to respectively max 60/65-65 you should be fine. Northbridge of rampage formula is hot though at 1.33V the NB load temps already are around 46-48, but upping this to 1.57 only increases this to around 55C. I even have an old AMD stock fan blowing on to it, I could lower these by reseating heatsink of NB maybe or using other TIM but cba as those temps are safe.
