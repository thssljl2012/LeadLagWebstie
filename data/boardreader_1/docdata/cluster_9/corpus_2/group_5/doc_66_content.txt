I don&amp;#039;t care which team you are rooting for this is a bad precedent for the courts to jump into. The anti-trust laws the NFL doesn&amp;#039;t have to follow help allow teams from smaller markets to exist. Once the courts start having a say this is the beginning of the end for small markets. Not only that but the players were given &amp;#039;due process&amp;#039; according to the CBA. This reminds me of the Casey Martin battle with the PGA Tour. Not good when the courts get involved.      Next the revenue sharing will come into question and the days of the likes of Green Bay and Minnesota being competitive will be over.       The Vikings may feel as though they&amp;#039;ve &amp;#039;won the battle,&amp;#039; but maybe at the cost of losing the war.
