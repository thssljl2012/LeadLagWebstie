I  know some of you might think this is just another piece of evidence showing the CBA is just a joke, but I have to say Chinese fans are really thrilled to wath NBA-caliber players exploded on their home soil. Fans are fans, and Chinese fans are genuine ones.       BTW, I just heard yesterday some Chinese announcers speculated that Chuck Hayes and Luther Head were likely to land contracts with CBA teams sometime later in their careers.       Again, CBA is nothing to compare to NBA, but I see this as an unfair comparison. Fans just want to watch good players play basketball, no matter the arena is here in China or over there in America.      The Rockets team and players really have good exposure in China. Chinese fans know the name of every player on the roster. No doubt about that.       Two other ex-Rockets players are currently playing with CBA teams, Mike Harris and Kirk Snyder.                            So even the Chinese know Chuck Hayes and Luther Head are scrubs.
