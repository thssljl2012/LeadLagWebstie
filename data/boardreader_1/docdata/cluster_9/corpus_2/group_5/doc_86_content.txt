 about every 6 weeks I buy a new one, I have neck problems, I just buy the cheap 10.00 walmart firm ones, they last for about a month and a half before my neck starts to hurt again and it&amp;#039;s time for a new one. How do the tem. pedic ones work out? I&amp;#039;ve always been a little hesitant to purchase one as they are a bit expensive. _________________      The &amp;amp;quot;banker&amp;amp;quot; for us bank @ 95th and nall, 913-649-7197, call me
