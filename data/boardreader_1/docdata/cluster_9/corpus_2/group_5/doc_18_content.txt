Curry was angry after the game?  Shiiiiiiiiiit.  I was cussing at the TV for the whole 4th quarter.  Where the hell was Iverson?  That's why you got AI in the first place!      You've got a guy who will either get fouled or get a layup or get someone an open shot and you leave him on the bench in order to play Will Freakin' Bynum?  This isn't the CBA, you're paid to win games, not teach lessons.      And how low has Amir Johnson sunk that he can't even get garbage time in 30 point games?
