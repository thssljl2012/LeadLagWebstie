I hope so too, i am flabbergasted to see some of the heartless and vile responses to this tragedy - I imagine a lot of these outrageous negative posts are written to get a reaction, like its the cool thing to do to post something cruel. Either that or these people are morally bankrupt and ignorant. A child is dead and a family is left to grieve, all of their posessions have been destroyed. Considering the state of our economy I didn&amp;#039;t exepct all the negative comments about bills not being paid. Everyone is doing their best and still it is hard for some to make ends meet. And I&amp;#039;m sure the members of their church will help, maybe they don&amp;#039;t have the resources to do it all and that&amp;#039;s why they&amp;#039;re asking for help from others. We don&amp;#039;t know the circumstances of the fire, maybe the mother did all she could to get the baby out but couldn&amp;#039;t. Either way there will be a hole in her heart for the rest of her life.  I see they are accepting donations and some local Bank of America branches, wish they had given more specific information. God bless this little girl and her family and may we all open our hearts and minds especially during the holidays.

I suppose no matter where you live, if you&amp;#039;re black, you are automatically: on drugs, a bad parent, on welfare.*SMDH*(as hard as some of us work, black, asian, hispanic, etc...it&amp;#039;ll never be enough to get past the ignorance of others) I would&amp;#039;ve done everything I could to save my children, but to lose a child...that has to be a gut-wrenching pain, unparalleled to anything known on this Earth. My heart &amp;amp;amp; condolences go out to this family. If the mother went to PHS, I know her. In most black churches, the positions they serve are voluteered...they don&amp;#039;t get paid to lead. Plus, who&amp;#039;s to say they wanted the church, or anyone else they are struggling. Most black people I know are extremely prideful, above anything else....not everyone qualifies for assistance. This is truly heartbreaking.
