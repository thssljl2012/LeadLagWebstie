Went for a cr attackfleet with cutlass for allydef, which worked quite well. Started to team up with Reese midround and we landed almost every attack.       Had a couple nice steals, capped 190k etd fr/de in one attack, and ended up with roughly 1.1 mil xan fi, out of which 600k was capped the last day  .      Finished researching scans fairly early, and did quite a lot of scans for denial.      Ok round i guess, although CBA beat me with less than 100k score
