Oh, the Lion isn't important   It's just a random lion.      NESSAROSE. Even though she's a bit of a bitch and weirdly religious. She's in it again and totally ADORABLE.      City of Emeralds.. That's just after Elphaba leaves Glinda, right?          'But the sting, to Glinda, was real' And some more I cba to quote but still remember        Elphaba in the book is better than Elphaba in the musical.
