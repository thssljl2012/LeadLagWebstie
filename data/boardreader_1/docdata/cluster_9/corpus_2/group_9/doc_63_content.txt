I hate hypocrisy. I like burritos, though.       Columbia, SC -- It turns out a burrito was to blame for a suspicious package scare at a Columbia bank Wednesday.     Crews were called to the Bank of America at 2805 Main Street just before 3 p.m.     Officers had gotten a report from bank employees of a brown bag that was left on a counter. The building was evacuated, and local homeland security officials and fire crews were called to the scene.     However, once the investigation was done, they determined the package contained the burrito.     It's not clear who left the food there.       Seriously? Homeland Security?!
