         i agree its time for a change i would use my browser alot more if it worked.don't get me wrong i use my laptop and pc alot but if the ps3 browser was better i would use it just so i could surf the net on my big screen.i got a 32 inch in my bedroom and it has no vga port (because i picked it up when first hd tv's come out).
