xD Well, if I do the multiplication whatall for, say, a circle-but it ends up as some HUGE number that my cacluclator would keel over dead if I actually tried to square it--     I can just leave it as...   -hugenumber-Squared, meters squared.     whereas if you guys write it as squared meters, that gets jumbled/more confusing.     (CBA=can't be assed)
