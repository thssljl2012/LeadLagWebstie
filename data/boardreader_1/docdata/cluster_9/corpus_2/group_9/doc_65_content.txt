He has coarser, lightly graying black hair and sits not to far up from where   Baseball Bob sits.           If this is the same guy, he works at US Bank. I use to work there about 10 years ago, although I didn't really know him. I still eat lunch about once a   week at the Lake View Market inside the US Bank building and pretty much see him every time I eat there (we apparently eat lunch at the same time). As a   matter of fact, I was there today and saw him.          Bingo!  Yes, that is Rick, he is another long time fan that has been to about as many games as Bob has, but obviously misses the Brewers broadcast and usually misses a pitch or two thanks to wanting something to drink or eat!     Thanks Patrick!     Rickey
