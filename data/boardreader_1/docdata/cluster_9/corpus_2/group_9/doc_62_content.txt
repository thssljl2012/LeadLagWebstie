It isn't because they rather move to another league.  I would take what the Miners' source said with a grain of salt.  This organization is out of money.  Former and present major league athletes don't want to lose money any more than anyone else.  Maybe they want to lose money even  less  than others because an athlete's career is so uncertain.                      The organization  is  out of money. That's quite obvious and has been for some time. Mr. Shuler is not. He could have, and according to the Miners' source, would have continued funding the organization had it moved to the PBL. It's really quite simple. He thought he was throwing good money after bad by paying to support a team in the dying CBA
