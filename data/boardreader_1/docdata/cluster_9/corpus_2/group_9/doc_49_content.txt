Situations like this are what the CBA is about, creating parity.  Consider that since the CBA era beginning in 1999, the only dynasty has been the Lakers, and some of their contracts were signed prior to the CBA.  Since them, we have seen titles by the Spurs, Pistons, Heat, Celtics.  Prior to these teams, the previous 12 titles were won by only 4 teams.  The CBA makes it difficult to build up super teams and keep them.  And if an owner wants to keep it together, it will cost him dearly. _________________ Congrats to FredG, the official LG NCAA tournament champ
