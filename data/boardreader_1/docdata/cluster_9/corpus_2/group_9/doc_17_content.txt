      I just had to say, that all this REI talk is making me want to go spend money!    Plus they sent out a new catalog  yesterday filled with all kinds of goodies. Really cool skirts and convertible pants/shorts.  AND we need a new tent, but will wait for the January sale for that along with our 10% back. But those skirts are just so freakin cute!!!   *sigh sigh sigh*  I hate you, Bank of America. HATE YOU!
