           Yes a very good game.  I did run my halftracks around his flank to divert some of his forces and to make his HQ moves so he would be low on ammo.  It worked to a point but not enough to stop his mass of Red from advanceing and devouring my troops.  For most of the game I only had 2 88 units and 2 tanks that could only do so much damage but could not slow down the enemy enough.  It was a shame that my reinforcments didnt arrive on time.  3 turns late then they had to travel over snowy muddy roads and only got to the fight in the last two turns.   Maybe if there were more turns the out come would have been different as I might have been able to use my engineer platoons as he would have had to assualt the town its self.  Anyways it was a fun game and I had alot of fun writing this informal AAR now I look forward to the new game me and Abatis are playing.  Also any comments would be welcomed on this AAR     DJ
