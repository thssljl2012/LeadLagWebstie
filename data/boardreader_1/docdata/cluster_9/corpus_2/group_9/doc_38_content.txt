Situations like this are what the CBA is about, creating parity.  Consider that since the CBA era beginning in 1999, the only dynasty has been the Lakers, and some of their contracts were signed prior to the CBA.  Since them, we have seen titles by the Spurs, Pistons, Heat, Celtics.  Prior to these teams, the previous 12 titles were won by only 4 teams.  The CBA makes it difficult to build up super teams and keep them.  And if an owner wants to keep it together, it will cost him dearly.                         Precisely.        Many fans don't realize it but most owners- including Jerry Buss - think that Donald Sterling has done a masterful job with the Clippers.  Only 3 or 4 playoff spots in 25 seasons, but they've turned a steady profit every year and are worth 15-20 X what Sterling paid for them. _________________ "Then (scout) Ronnie Lester saw him in a New York workout and said we should take another look."        So it was Ronnie Lester - not Jimmy Buss - who was the impetus behind the Bynum pick.         http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24939197/
