 The veteran contract hurts the older players ...        It's ironic: The NFL draft always spurs talk that rookies get paid too much, and the CBA should reward veterans. But if there's a salary cap, and rookies are cheaper than veterans, then it actually hurts veterans if there's too big a disparity.        Injuries will open up some spots for some of these veterans, though. It's one thing to carry a cheap rookie as the 11th player because she'll never see the court, but if a rotation player goes down, a veteran is going to help a team win a lot more than that cheap rookie.    _________________ Clay Kallam
