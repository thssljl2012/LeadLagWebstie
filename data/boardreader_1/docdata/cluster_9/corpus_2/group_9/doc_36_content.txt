 oh yes. I live in Medford and my house is priced accordingly to Bank of America at $313,000. But my next door neighbour just sold for $350,000.    Unfortunately we bought in 2004 for $429,000. Not as bad as some houses that went for over $500,000 two years ago. But it still is shocking.    dont you hate when your dh says ; yes, honey, in 2004 you wanted to sell our old house and I said no.    told you so, we should have sold then.    Oh well, we can just ride it out.    d
