            The German engineers barely hang onto the objectives in the middle of the map as the brunt of the soviet attack bears down on them.  I continue my probe of the enemy looking for weak spots but not seeing any......  I wish my tanks would hurry up and deploy to their positions I could have used them 40 mins ago.  But for now my troops must hold on in their trenchs until reinforcments arrive.
