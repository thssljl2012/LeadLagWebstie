The difference is the fact that Stafford and Smith are much better prospects than Oher.         ...and there is no reason to blow the rookie scale up.  It is going to be blown up in a year when they renegotiate the CBA.         Put me in the camp that the Lions would be fools not to take Stafford.  He is a VERY similar prospect IMO to Carson Palmer (only Stafford lacks the ideal size) and people said the same things about Palmer the year he was drafted as people are saying about Stafford now.        Stafford is a very good NFL prospect.  There are a ton of NFL QB's that can't make the type of throws this kid can make.
