I can't really say what I think the cap should be, because I don't know all the business that goes into it, but there definitely needs to be some sort of cap on what these top 10 picks get paid, because losing teams don't want to invest millions into guys they aren't even  sure about.  You gotta keep the player in mind though - veteran or rookie. If you set the cap way too low, those guys could get stuck in a contract that would underpay them for years. I am confident that the players union and NFL will hammer out what is the best for everyone.
