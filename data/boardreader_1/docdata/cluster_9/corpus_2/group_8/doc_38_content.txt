    For all you BofA lovers congrat  .  We are on our way for somebig bucks this year.  (sorry on coins on this baby )This bank was started way before our time, and it will be still be going strong, long after we are gone. I'm personallyputtingevery $$$$ that I can possibly get my hands on for this winner.By this summer we should all be singing the blues  and as happy as can be.        What would the world think, and say  of us, if "Bank of America" no longer existed?  Just having the word "America" in there is very big for this company. Just think about it...        See you all in  Hawaii  this summer.         Take care.    ps: My biggest problem will be coming there alone. ((((     ))))
