        QUOTE (Chandler#81 &#064; Mar 5 2009, 09:28 PM)       Sign of the times, I feel. It just isn't wise to publicly support athletes on your team anymore. Too many red faces later. It's time to implement serious character requirements and financial repercusions in every player contract - much more so they they do, currently. To me, it's just not enough to sign a player. There's too much at stake with marketing a franchise.     CIN put in contract language after Carl Picken's antics several years ago - return of signing bonus and cancellation of contract for actions "detrimental to the team".   They invoked the clause once - punter Lee Johnson made some comments about lousy coaching or some such. Which was a pretty weak reason for canning him, IMO.  Nevertheless, the NFLPA demanded that such contract clauses be eliminated - and they were with the new CBA.
