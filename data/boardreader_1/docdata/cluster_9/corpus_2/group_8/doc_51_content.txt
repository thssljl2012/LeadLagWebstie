  Hello ladies! I'm Jessica, 25, mommy to Giana (6/9/02), Mariah (4/10/05) and Angelina (1/30/09). I got pregnant with #1 when I was 17 (turned 18 when I was 5 months). So yep, 25 with 3 kids...lol. DH and I have been together since I was 15 and he was 19. We got engaged 1/16/03 and married 5/13/06. We live in Connecticut. I'm on maternity leave right now (and until May) but I work for Bank of America and DH is a manager at Walmart.
