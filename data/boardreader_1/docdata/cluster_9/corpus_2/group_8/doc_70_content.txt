On topic, xan ARE kinda underpowered this round, harpy init should never have changed and instead should've had an armor and maybe damage boost. Still, they're not too bad, great escort for my co fleet!                      ^^         Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  isildurx                      Could have something to do with CBA being in a fence gal and not having to atleast 2 fleet def every night?

Byrney stated all the obvious and gave an actualy opinion of how Xans ARE underpowered and they are good for escorting CO    any other thoughts?
