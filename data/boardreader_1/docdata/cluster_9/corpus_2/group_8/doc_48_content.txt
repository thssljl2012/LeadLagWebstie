both have their base salaries drop in 2010.  and both deals could've been structured in a way to include plenty more money in 2010, a potential uncapped year. very odd to me.   www.nyjetscap.com   Truthfully, the same thing was done w/Sheppard too, w/the base salaries starting at 2.7 M and escalating (assuming the 1.55 M kicker that is easily attainable).  i mean, frankly, he MUST be anticipating a new CBA. otherwise, I don't think he'd be purposefully lowering 2010 cap numbers.
