           Quoting  Lexy  ( Reply 8 ):     I still haven't really figured out why they are starting this up in the first place. Is it not already easy enough to get from NYC to London?? How much easier does it have to be for the "business" traveller? You already have  AA ,  BA ,  BA  OpenSkies, and others flying constantly from NYC to London (although it isn't to  LCY ) thorughout the day.          As GDB highlights this route is entirely for the business market. For starters Canary Wharf is now home to the two largest banks in the world (HSBC and Bank of America), the largest law firm in the world (Clifford Chance), numerous other banks(Citibank, Barclays), law firms (Allen and Overy), publishers (McGraw Group), news agencies (Reuters), oil companies (BP) etc. In fact if you name a major multi national company, the chances are that they have an office in Canary Wharf. Coupled with that the traditional City of London, (the area around Bank tube) which is still home to a large number of organisations, is only about a 15min ride of the DLR to London City.       If you look at the journey time from Canary Wharf to  LHR , it is a 35-40 minute tube ride (with changes) to Paddington Station, then a 15 min ride on the Heathrow Express. Really this means that during the an off peak time it will take over an hour door to door (excluding waiting time for the Heathrow Express/tube)  LCY  is only a 10min ride on the DLR from Canary Wharf, and they claim you can be from check in to the aircraft in less than 10mins!       So as you can see there is a lot less hassle in traveling from  LCY  for the business man. This is the reason for this flight.  LCY  is a very popular airport with the businesman and has none of the mess of  LHR .       By car from Canary Wharf to  LHR  it is almost impossible. No better highlighted than by the fact that it took me 45 minutes the other morning to get along the Heathrow Spur Road and tunnel to Terminal 1! Thats 45mins to go a distance of some 1.5miles.       If you have ever tried landing at  LHR  and getting to Canary Wharf at 8am in the morning you will quickly see how much easier this will be for business passengers.       Of course there is also the added advantage of clearing US Immigration in  SNN . This is a huge advantage for British based businessmen.      It doesn't matter how many flights there are from LON-NYC per se, the important fact is the easier traveling to  LCY  and the ease of traveling through  LCY  that is important.
