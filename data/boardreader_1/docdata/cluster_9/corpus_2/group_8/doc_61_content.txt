Basically, the league has a real financial problem through the Summer of 2011 when a new CBA will be negotiated.  Until then, teams are trapped into a pay structure that was negotiated when economic times were different.  A lot of teams are going to go broke if they don't get some sort of relief.  They can't just arbitrarily cut players' salaries in the midst of a negotiated contract, but perhaps they can work out some sort of exception where they can cut players and expunge them from salary cap and luxtax computations (while still honoring the terms of their contract).
