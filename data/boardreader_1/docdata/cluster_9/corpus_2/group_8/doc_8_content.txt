 No one really knows what would happen exactly, all I know for sure guys like Jennings, Collins, Colledge, Spitz, Blackmon, Jolly would all be RFA, Kampman would be our only big time UFA I think. As far as the tenders go I have no idea if it would work the same or if the tenders are apart of the same CBA is being voided and thus causing an uncapped year. _________________           Nick Collins belongs in the Pro Bowl!!
