Every snap he gets at tackle takes his market value way up! If we don't have a deal done with Colledge before the draft it could tell the tail for me because odds are his market value next year (if he gets tackle snaps) will take him out of TT guard money.             True, but with the CBA expiring, we have the rights to College until 2012 for a fairly cheap price I believe, so we don't need to break the bank yet, for guys like him, Collins, or Jennings.             IMO we can still pull off a 5 for just over Jake Scott money with Colledge.        He takes too many more snaps at LT, and we're looking at Clifton money IMO.          I don't think he's too far from taking a 5M/yr to 7-8M/yr jump.  It would behoove TT to beat that jump, saving the team 10-15M over the next half decade.             What are the RFA prices for keeping players in there 4th and 5th years, because that should have an impact on how much he makes.             For a LT......        2.5M, the high tender, we'll lose him if we only put a 1st tender on him.        He plays LT and gets good......what did Gross get, 10M/yr.....        That's tough to swallow to save a buck for a year, in a year when there is no cap.        Jennings and Collins have proven themselves enough that good play isn't significantly changing their pricetag.  Colledge should be the first extension IMO, there is a lot of $$ to be saved by moving ASAP.             I'd extend him if he wants top guard money, but not for top tackle money. If we put a 1st round tender on him and someone bit next year, I'd take the pick.  A true ZBS line doesn't need star OL, Denver and Atlanta proved that, a 1st round pick is more valuable then any OL on our team.              Why did Shanny take Clady at 12? _________________                hauschild wrote:           I really have no clue
