So say it is alzner as the emergency call up, does it not count towards something in his contract? CBA baking soda or some dung beetle like that?     Nope.  A game played in the NHL is a game played.  That's a baseball rule I think.      Yeah, but it probably doesn't count as one of our 4 allowed callups.  That might be a plus.      winning answer.
