Was at taco bell going to order that chessy double beef burrito for .89 cents so i'm in line with a friend of mine and he asks what you going to get? I tell him that chessy double beef burrito it's .89 cents and he tells me you sure about that you could buy 1 share of citibank for that burrito. haha was laughing my ass off, citibank is screwed if a taco bell chessy double beef burrito is more expensive than one share of there stock, Gosh we as screwed as a nation
