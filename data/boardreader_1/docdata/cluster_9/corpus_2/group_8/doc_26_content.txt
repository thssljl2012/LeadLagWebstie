 We had a lazy guide you just decided to drop us off at the entrance (after paying 92 dollars for her to be our guide) but I was happy with that.   I did hear a couple of the guides talking and their new were the good picture spots were but seemed like they they new very little about photography (one was telling a cust how good his walmart tripod was for long exposures).  The guides were not a problem it was a big group (20-25) of German tourists who were loud, got in the way, and helped me smashed my flash.  My wife and high were alone for some of the time so a few good pictures were happy.  If you go, don't go in early summer - the crowds are supposed to be much worse and maybe try the lower canyon which is more difficult but has less tourists.  I used the "tour" provider Antelope canyon Navajo tours.  They rip you off but leave you alone.  Thank you for the compliment.  falsepositive wrote:     &gt; Aaron,   &gt; Great photos of an absolutely inspiring place.  Bravo on a job well   &gt; done.   &gt; I'm curious to know whether the Navajo guide service that you must   &gt; use to walk through the canyon is very photographer friendly?  I   &gt; looks like you were able to break away from the group to take   &gt; solitary pictures.  Is that easily done?  How big were the groups you   &gt; hiked with?   &gt;    &gt; Thanks for posting these pictures.  I'm very anxious to hear your reply.   &gt;    &gt; Dave         --   Aaron W.
