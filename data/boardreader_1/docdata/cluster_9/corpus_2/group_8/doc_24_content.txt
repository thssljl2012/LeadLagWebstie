Basically, the Leafs bought themselves a draft pick. They took 3 players (Kolzig, Rogers, Heward) for 500k in cap space according to Miller, for Petiot (worthless). And got themselves a draft pick. You can't trade moeny in the CBA, so thats why Petiot is in the deal.    Interesting way of working around the salary cap if you are interested in that.    Basically, a 4th round pick for 500 000.
