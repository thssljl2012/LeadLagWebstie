Have they ever tested the rules that allow you to keep the CBA employees in the nonexcludable group if the benefits and plan provisions are the same for CBA and non-CBA plans?      I have seen this in one case, but it's probably unusual since the CBA plans are ...well... bargained, and would change all the time, and the non-CBA participants might not like being in the same basket w.r.t. retirement benefits (or more likely now, the employer might not like giving the same level of benefits to non-union employees).
