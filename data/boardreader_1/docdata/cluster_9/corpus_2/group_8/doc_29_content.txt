      I hope this isnt considered "Off-Topic". But.. I have to ask.  Under the current CBA, Is there a "Luxury Tax" or "Cap Penalty" for going over the cap? I searched a few places but could get a definite answer..... It appears that the Rangers are over the cap and have a Cap Penalty of 700,000.   Just confused about why they have a Cap Penalty imposed when your not supposed to be over....
