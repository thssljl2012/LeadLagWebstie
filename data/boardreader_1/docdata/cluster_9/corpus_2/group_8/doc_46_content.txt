          I don't think it will work either but it's worth a try. It's always a gamble when doing things that haven't been done before.    It would work if people bothered to put the effort in. It's seriously not hard to arrange a time between 4 people and get it played. People on here just cba and expect everything done for them like they are babies tbh.    We'll give it another week and if it doesn't work then i'll scrap it
