 http://www.nypost.com/seven/03112009/sports/rangers/rangers  _gain_draft_pick_for_cherepanovs__159043.htm   PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Before making really sophomoric remarks about class, or selfishness, realize that the pick was compensation for a 1st-round pick like Cherapanov   not being signed at the time of his death.     It's a rule in the CBA and the Rangers are not the first team to be incuding in it.        However, the GM's spoke about compensation rules for players who pass away, like Bourdon or the Flames prospect who passed.   http://tsn.ca/columnists/bob_mckenzie/?id=270631   "In other business, the NHL will be seeking approval from the NHLPlayers' Association to amend the Collective Bargaining Agreement toallow for compensatory draft picks to be awarded in the event of thedeath of a player. This became an issue after Russian prospect  AlexeiCherepanov died and the New York Rangers raised the issue with the league. If theNHLPA signs off on it, a team would receive a second round pick if oneof their prospects dies before signing a contract with the NHL club"   I remember this topic heated up some argument about the justification, but remember that the CBA states the following on compensation for unsigned 1st rounders. Per the CBA:       A team that does not sign a first-round draft pick is awarded acompensatory pick in a future draft upon losing the rights to thatplayer.
