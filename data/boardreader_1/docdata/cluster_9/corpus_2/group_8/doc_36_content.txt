I lived in FL many years, never bought a house, but helped run the Red Cross shelter at our church for the hurricane refugees. It's hard on those folks who live in less-likely-storm-damage FL towns to subsidize the coastal condos. One of our sons is a master carpenter in FL, and house damage would boost his business, but he'd probably spend a lot of time volunteering to clean up first.
