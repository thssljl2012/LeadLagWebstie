I think we will know by March 1st if Brady will be 100%.  That&amp;#039;s 5 months from now, the training staff should know how his rehab is going.  I think you have to take your chances with O&amp;#039;Connel as the primary backup.                      With no CBA, we won&amp;#039;t be extending Wilfork and Seymour.      If 2010 is uncapped, we&amp;#039;ll take advantage of that. I don&amp;#039;t see us extending guys when we could take advantage of a huge windfall opportunity in 2010.
