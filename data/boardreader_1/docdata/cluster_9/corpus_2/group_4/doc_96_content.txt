                                                                   The point is, perhaps the PA doesn&amp;#039;t decide where teams go etc. But they do decide whether they wish to open up the CBA. The PA wants more money, so they want more revenue, so they want another team in Southern Ontario. Is it so inconceivable that they could come to some sort of understanding with the NHL that  they stick to the current deal with the acknowledgment that when expansion comes up, the NHL actually puts a team in a market that will draw fans and bolster revenue?
