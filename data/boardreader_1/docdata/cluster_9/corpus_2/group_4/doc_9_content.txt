 OK, so we&amp;#039;ve eliminated &amp;#039;simple&amp;#039; stuff ... that&amp;#039;s me out of ideas ...      Not really.  next I&amp;#039;d check fuel filter, fuel lift pump and fuel pipes aren&amp;#039;t blocked and all allow a good flow of fuel.  As you&amp;#039;ve shown it can get up to revs when stood and can&amp;#039;t when under load it has to be fuelling then, and possibly a bit costly in either parts or time to fix.      I&amp;#039;d also consider taking it to a local garage and have them check the injector timing and injectors. (Mainly &amp;#039;cos I dunno how to do it myself and cba to read up on it until I need to)
