Jazz Jackrabbit, duke nukem, mortal combat. I only had Jazz Jackrabbit tho, but my cousin had duke nukem and mortal combat.        OT: I dl&amp;#039;d Jazz Jackrabbit a couple of weeks ago and it is a .ISO file. I cba to burn it to a cd and Daemon tools aint working, so is there any other ways of playing?
