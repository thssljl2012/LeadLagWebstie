So remember if you have to pick up a mate from the pub remember to call by the hospital park up walk down a grab a kebab before returning to your car.                      They have something like this in canada or the states. Which IMO is an awesome scheme.    They&amp;#039;re not allowed to drive after a set time and they&amp;#039;re not allowed to have passengers under the age of 21 i think.    Both these things seem small - but you&amp;#039;re not going to have the peer pressure of your mate sat next to you urning you to floor it.    And the curfew time is there because the majority of crashes happen at night.       There&amp;#039;s been a noticable drop in crashes in the places where this is upheld.    (I cba to find proof  )
