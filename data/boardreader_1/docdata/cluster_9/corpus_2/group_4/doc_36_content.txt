Either way, I never said employees aren&amp;#039;t a right.  Making a counterargument that has nothing to do with the original argument and does nothing to dispel the point doesn&amp;#039;t make the original point irrelavent.  And it demonstrates poor debate skills.  The point was how STEVE FRANCIS handled the situation, NOT WHAT fictional rights Vancouver violated by &amp;amp;quot;having the audacity to draft him&amp;amp;quot;.                         Let me word this slowly, so that even you understand. When you say &amp;amp;quot;Playing in the NBA is a  privilege !!!!!!!!!&amp;amp;quot; You are saying &amp;amp;quot;Having a job is a  privilege ,&amp;amp;quot; because the NBA is an employer. So it&amp;#039;s a specific employer, but even if reword that to read &amp;amp;quot;Working for IBM isn&amp;#039;t a right, it&amp;#039;s a  privilege ,&amp;amp;quot; we end up with the same problem. IBM has no &amp;amp;quot;constitutional right&amp;amp;quot; to employees. Neither does the NBA. Hence the absurdity of your claim. In other words, &amp;amp;quot;the constitution&amp;amp;quot; has nothing to do with it.       There were two parties, one did not want to work for the other. He even politely told them so beforehand. The second party chose to attempt to force the first party to work for them anyways. Steve Francis handled the situation the only way the rules allowed him to (which is what I&amp;#039;ve said all along). The only option the CBA left him in choosing his employer was to let other possible employers know that he wouldn&amp;#039;t work for them, and then be prepared to live with the consequences.

I was talking about the Canadian basketball league, not to be confused with the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  As I alluded to, I couldn&amp;#039;t care less WHERE Francis played.                        There is no &amp;amp;quot;Canadian basketball league&amp;amp;quot; that I&amp;#039;m aware of. The basketball league you might be thinking of is the  Continental  Basketball Association, but it&amp;#039;s not really germane to what you&amp;#039;re talking about. It truly is impossible to discuss NBA labour law  without making a single reference to the  C ollective  B argaining  A greement . Hence my references to it when posting about the situation between Francis &amp;amp;amp; the Grizzlies. Please, in the future, think before you post. You&amp;#039;ll save yourself a lot of embarrassment.

Didn&amp;#039;t Mayo have a fit early on about NOT wanting to end up in Memphis?  What happened?  THe teams called their bluffs and they signed.  You act like this was an isolated occurance and SO rare, that organizations were obligated to take things at face value.  It didn&amp;#039;t work out with Francis, but BOTH SIDES are equally culpable in that outcome, not just &amp;amp;quot;big bad big business&amp;amp;quot;.                        I&amp;#039;m not sure what you&amp;#039;re talking about with the &amp;amp;quot;big, bad business&amp;amp;quot; nonsense. Steve Francis made his intentions clear before the draft. Vancouver took a huge gamble and lost. That wasn&amp;#039;t Francis&amp;#039; fault. You&amp;#039;re getting angry at him for not folding, but he was very clear from the outset, he didn&amp;#039;t force Vancouver into making the losing bet.

They might have ended up with the better player as a result.
