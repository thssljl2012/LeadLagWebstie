Billups and McDyess together don&amp;#039;t make enough to match Iverson&amp;#039;s $20.8 mil  However, you might see a small deal like Sharpe + cash for someone&amp;#039;s TPE, to get DET back under the lux.  Is Sharpe enough?    My math shows that they took on  $20.8  while sending out $18.66.  That leaves them at +$2.1 mill or roughly $70 mill, which is still below the lux tax threshold and probably allows them to re sign Dice at the vets min without going over.
