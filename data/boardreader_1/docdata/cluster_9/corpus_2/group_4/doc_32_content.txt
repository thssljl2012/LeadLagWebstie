Three letters are why MLS will succeed and USL won&amp;#039;t, and why everyone wants out of USL and into MLS.   S.U.M.         SUM makes money and holds TV contracts for the league and for World cup.  Not all mls teams are making money but i bet because of SUM all MLS owners are making money.  Nike may bring in the corporate sponsors, but they can&amp;#039;t bring the TV contracts, and that is what has cemented MLS for good.  Even with the low value compared to Football or baseball, MLS has steady money coming in until 2014.  if anyone thinks that this economic crisis is going to last till 2014 then you are crazy.  plus that gives MLS 6 years to work on its product and build relationships.        Nike is pissed that adidas has exclusive rights in MLS and is trying to get USL to compete with MLS.  No TV no competition.  USL would never get a Becks regardless of age.  MLS could and did.  USL will not complete and Saputto knows it.  They don&amp;#039;t want to shell out 40 mil, and in todays market i don&amp;#039;t blame them.        USL can&amp;#039;t compete with and is not bettter than MLS (as a buisness).  One year in CCL does not prove USL is better quality soccer.  Who won the open cup this year, and every year except &amp;#039;99.  Lets see what happens in the next 2-3 yrs in CCL before we start saying USL is better.        Single entitiy although hated on B.S. is what has brought cost certainty to the owners.  The league will negotiate a new CBA and i bet raises the cap significantly to quash any USL attempts and competing for players, and MLS goes on to grow and compete well with mexico in concacaf.  USL always 2nd division.
