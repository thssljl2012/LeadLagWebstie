Serious! lol      Blueprints but they loose their edge after a few weeks.. Past few years I&amp;#039;ve really liked the death decks.      I&amp;#039;ve actually Owned 3 of this         Pretty much one of the sexyist decks and best decks I&amp;#039;ve ridden although I did have to get use to the rock pop when I first got one but felt amazing!!      and currently riding this:          It was good for a couple of weeks then went very rubbish very quick as I thought        As for delams   As I use to skate a lot of street doing sets/gaps most of the day you end up on your arse/zooming very rarely de lams instant but the edges get bit rough and skanky then suddenly go! I&amp;#039;m rubbish with control of flips down sets.. I usually do it reasonably perfect or end up messing it up/kicking out. It reminds me of how much I hated when I got BS wrong down stairs   Some people thought I had a large symmetrically tattoo or something removed from my lower back and I always ended up landing on my lower back if I stacked      Also you have to constantly push your self else you get rubbish quick!      Past couple of year I&amp;#039;ve made a lazy move to light street/mini ramp/park skating.. I&amp;#039;ve had a deck last me like 6 months once?!!!! compared to 3-4 weeks!      I feel like joining side walk forums now   When I&amp;#039;m at uni I rarely skate.. The skate scene is good here but I cba with street due to max effort and I&amp;#039;m not a great fan of the level park here!
