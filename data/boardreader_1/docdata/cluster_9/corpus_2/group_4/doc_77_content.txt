Searched CBA and old threads and could not find answers.    1.  Is CIC a one-for-one hour makeup or can you go +6 hours over your CIC balance for the Bid month?    2.  Does a CIC trip plus up you computed BLG for the month or is it considered makeup (i.e. makeup pay status)?  For example.  If for some reason you drop a CIC trip, are you in the hole for the month on your BLG or is it like dropping a M/U trip?    Thanks
