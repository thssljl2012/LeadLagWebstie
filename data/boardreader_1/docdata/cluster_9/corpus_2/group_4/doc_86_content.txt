What I hate are douchebags who try roll you  . On saturday i was sitting up the back of the bus (no one else was up there) when 4 guys get on, 2 sit behind me, 1 to the side and one infront, all staring at me. They all looked like just the type who would cause trouble. then i pause my mp3 to hear &amp;quot;oh did you get seen by the camera on the bus? na my hat was covering my head etc&amp;#039; &amp;#039;So what do **** has this guy got? An mp3 and probs a phone or some ****&amp;#039;        So by then i obviously knew what they were gunna do, so quickly just bailed down the bus and out the door, then headed straight into an ANZ bank for a minute. A similar incident happened last year where a guy pulled a knife on my friend, and i dont want that **** again. Why dont those scum kids get a job. _________________
