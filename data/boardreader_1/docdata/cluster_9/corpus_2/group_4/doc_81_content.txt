The hogan family has been removed from 714. really ,before you get to crazy about what your saying, know what your talking about first, don&amp;#039;t quote old information and come to some sort of conclusion on what is going on now,that is not the actions of a responsible person, you talk about looking out for the officers,i beleive the teamsters are our best chance of doing that very thing.i have spoken to officers in the last several days that have had grievances returned to them, telling them they lost their grievance(9 months later),map is telling them it&amp;#039;s only a written reprimand and that they can&amp;#039;t help them. read the interest arbitration that shows what exactly map did or better yet did not do to help us in that arbitration, and maybe you will not be yelling for map over and over again, if you voted for the teamsters 15 or 20 years ago because they gave you a hot dog and a beer, then you sold out,for cheap. better yet maybe that is why we are in the position we are in now.teamsters may have sucked back then and i will take you at YOUR WORD,however, i know what we have now,map,failed miserably in arbitration,are failing to represent officers due to bad language in the (cba), or are letting administration push past the agreed on time limits, that they have to hear grievances,this directly effects those same officers you are talking about. the teamsters have won in arbitration against the county, the hogans are gone, and if we continue on a course that your suggesting what will we receive in return?(please provide useful information,no feelings allowed,or outdated information) i really wish you would look at that arbitration report then maybe you would realize that someone else just might be the jack   . a change is needed,that is how afscme got in the door,or in-service,or around the compound, and let me just say that if afscme gets in they will make map look golden. between afscme and the sgts. they have already spent a good number of years screwing up our negotiations withthe county. we have to go with a union that will give us the best chance at winning in arbitration,if theydon&amp;#039;t do what we ask,then get rid of them,but at least give yourself a chance at a better contract.TEAMSTERS FOR ME                      afcsme-please ,they sell out faster then any union, teamsters-if you try to tell me they are not hooked up with organized crime still to this day -I got a bridge for sale that you would probably buy. The only other union left is map,they might not be great but until the fop tries to be our union i will stick with map .thank you very much.
