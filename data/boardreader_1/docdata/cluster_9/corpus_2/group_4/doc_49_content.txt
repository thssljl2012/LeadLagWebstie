          Yeah the password is definitely correct, checked for upper/lower case and everything. I will try WEP first, but when I was using WEP before on my old router, my parents bought a new laptop which runs Vista and it wouldn&amp;#039;t work with WEP, had to change to WPA. Also have read of people having dropping connections on this router using WEP.    Other alternative is to go back to my old router but it&amp;#039;s quite old and unreliable, plus cba to copy all the new settings over. I shall try with WEP anyway.    I did log a question with Netgear but from what others have said in other forums it seems unlikely that they&amp;#039;ll come back with anything useful as it&amp;#039;s third party firmware.         &amp;amp;nbsp;
