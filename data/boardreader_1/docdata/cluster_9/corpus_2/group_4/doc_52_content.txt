Ah that&amp;#039;s a bit of a pain if it&amp;#039;s too far :( We just put ours in at night when our son goes to bed and it&amp;#039;s all over the carpet in the living room.. very annoying! Would put it round the walls but cba coz we are moving soon lol. Glad it seems to be a bit better now.. I noticed before with our ps3 that if we were running videos on youtube or something at the same time it tended to d/c more often or if we were d/l something.
