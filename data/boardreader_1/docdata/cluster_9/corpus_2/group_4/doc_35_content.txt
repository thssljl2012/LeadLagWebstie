                     Re: Tripod                                     Manfrotto Modo  http://www.warehouseexpress.com/prod...px?sku=1014517  would seem to fit the bill for what you want. Its what i have atm for general walk around use (cba carrying a tripod that weighs a ton and cant justify spending  on carbon fibre)      It isnt that sturdy by comparison with some of the ones you see mentioned on this forum but it should suffice for general use.                                              __________________        When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs.
