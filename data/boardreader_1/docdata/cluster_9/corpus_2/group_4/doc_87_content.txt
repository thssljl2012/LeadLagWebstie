  Under the current CBA, I don&amp;#039;t think there&amp;#039;s been one player to turn down the max from the team they&amp;#039;re currently on to sign with another team. Elton Brand was close but the Clippers never quite offered the max. The Knicks are hoping two players will do it.     Honestly, I applaud the move. They stink and might as well do something drastic. I just think that in all liklihood they will not prevail. But since they&amp;#039;re going nowhere as it is, might as well roll the dice. In the end, I think Lebron stays a Cav. They&amp;#039;re a pretty good team.    Great move for the Knicks. An NBA team with a plan. I love it.   How much more do they get if they stay with the current team - $20 million? James could easily triple that via endorsements playing in New York instead of Cleveland.   That&amp;#039;s the allure that the Knicks have, and other teams don&amp;#039;t.    [Note: It&amp;#039;s also why teams like the Wolves and Grizzlies will have to overpay for second-rate talent and cast-offs.]
