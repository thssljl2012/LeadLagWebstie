The town centre mall has been struggling from the moment Marathon opened.  They have a fair amount of success, thank goodness for Commonwealth bank in there, along with Furniture Plus, but frankly, I don&amp;#039;t see how any of their non-food stores are able to pay their rent.  One can throw rocks and hit no one at any time (except for Christmas) in there.
