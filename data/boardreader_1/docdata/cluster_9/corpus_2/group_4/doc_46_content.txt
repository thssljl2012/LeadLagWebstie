He was the right guy at the time for this league and has performed above and beyond.      But now we are at a different crossroads. This is a crossroads that can define our league for the next two decades. These are some of the problems that we face and if executed wrong could turn fans away in droves and at the same time cause the league to stagnate into its demise.     1. Scheduling conflicts  2. Fifa Calendar alignment  3. CBA  4. Salary Cap/DP rule  5. Int&amp;#039;l competitiveness     Now the question is can Garber walk us down that path? Can he bring us to the HOLY GRAIL of soccer fandom? Does he have the compability to explain to the BoG&amp;#039;s that soccer is NOT a summer sport, etc etc and make them open their wallets?     What do you think might be best?                         There are a lot of people on BS that want everything they want when the want it. Some of you folks need to change your expectations of where this league should be. A lot of the posters remind me of spoiled children. You want everything now without working for it.      For crying out loud, this league is in it&amp;#039;s infintile stages compared to EPL, La Liga, Bundes Liga, Serie A, NFL, NBA, MLB NHL etc. etc.      Garber and the owners have built a sustainable business model that is built to last many years beyond the 13 years this league has been in existance. The man is not perfect but he has done a great job steering this league in the right direction. When he took over in 2001 this league was close to folding.      The league is now experiencing unpresedented growth and success. It is really easy to sit behind the comfort our our keyboards and be over critical and look at the negative instead of the positive.      Yes, we should keep the bar high, yes we should be critical but balanced. Let&amp;#039;s adjust our expectations and quit comparing MLS to other leagues that have been around for much longer and have a lot more $$. If not, it will always be easy to be disappointed and negative which is very non productive.
