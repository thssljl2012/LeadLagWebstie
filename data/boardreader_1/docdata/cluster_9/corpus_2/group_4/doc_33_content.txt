 Full Summary of Projects - Page 459 - SkyscraperCity The Primark building must have got a clean quite recently as i wouldnt say it was dirty at all. It probably happened when it was changed from being Allders in 2005?    If the we had more white buildings the dirt would show up much more, like what you see in most other cities. Thankfully Hull built most of its buildings out of Brick following WW2.         Quote:                         We should have a &amp;amp;quot;Hull wash day&amp;amp;quot; once a year were the council urges companies to clean their buildings in the city for the day... use a before and after of the new Barclays to prove their point.                     Great idea. Plus it wouldnt have to be done for another 10 years or so.
