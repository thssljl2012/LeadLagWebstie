  Thoughts on Ben Wallace?     Lol! The same thoughts I had when he was allegedly an all star.    Can&amp;#039;t pass, dribble, shoot...just a good effort guy whose contract demands and eventual landing of that contract has taken away his hunger and now he is a guy who should be in the CBA (if it still existed).      lol
