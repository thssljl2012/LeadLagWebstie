      Very true about the Browns. Although IIRC(actually if the Browns fans that still complain to this day are right), the city of Cleveland was about to vote on whether a new stadium should be built, but Modell didn&amp;#039;t give them the chance. Of course, this is all based on what Cleveland fans have said, I was only 8 at the time and only remember the team leaving.         But the Lions won&amp;#039;t move for a while even without fan support. They&amp;#039;ll still have revenue generated from the revenue sharing part of the CBA, and they have a fairly new stadium. The ONLY way the Lions leave Detroit anytime soon is if Ford goes under, the family has to sell, and whoever buys the team has plans to move them. But that&amp;#039;s something that can happen anywhere.
