This is against the CBA. Toronto must have 13 players on their roster at any given time. This puts us at 10. Jefferson is a great player and if we could manage the upper brass to let us go into the luxury tax to make this move and sign the players to put us up to 13 then it&amp;#039;s a easy yes.  I wouldn&amp;#039;t trade Bargnani for Yi at this point Bargnani looks like he&amp;#039;s improving and could be a good defensive player with the right time. His value is up right now and better then it was since last year, I don&amp;#039;t see the Bucks making this deal since they give up a comparable player to get RJ why null that?
