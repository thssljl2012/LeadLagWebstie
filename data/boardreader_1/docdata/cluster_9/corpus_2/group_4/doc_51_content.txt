                                         Quote:                          Originally Posted by  Temjin                         Do you know that I applied for a graduate position in CBA (Financial Planning) and there were 1700 applicants and they only looking for ONE graduate in Brisbane? I was lucky enough to be short listed to 80 ppls for interview without a relevant bachelor degree.                                             This is starting to look like 1970-1974.  Heaps of people applying for the same job - and not just in tertiary qualified positions.  It will I think, sadly, impact on a number of ppls.  A real bummer for those finishing their hard yakka at Uni and finding that there is nothing out there.  Wife went through that scenario.  PdD&amp;#039;s driving taxis sort of stuff.      Many will be shocked to learn that the employment world has changed very, very quickly.
