He&amp;#039;d have to prove that he truly was hurt - and probably unable to ever play again - to get the money.      So, quite simply, he can&amp;#039;t fake an injury just to get the money.

Plus he could tank on them with it being a bad year.  It&amp;#039;s a shrewd move and it sounds crazy but I agree with it now because he is not living up to production.                      Yes, I would agree, calling it a shrewd move does sound - and is - crazy.        Sheesh, talk about being an apologist....
