I&amp;#039;m with Johnston -- I think the GM/front office is pretty damn essential. It&amp;#039;s a much more complicated gig than it was pre-lockout. The Spurs management team probably belongs in any discussion of greatest front offices of all time across all sports, right up there with the Branch Rickey Dodgers and Bill Walsh Niners and John Wooden/Sam Gilbert UCLA teams.  West&amp;#039;s skillz deteroriated at the same time the new CBA went into effect and made business acumen just as important as the ability to judge basketball horseflesh (and the influence of agents went away overnight). I&amp;#039;ll never deny that Krause made lots of great complementary moves, but it was Jordan who essentially facilitated all of it. The one constant across eras is that drafting remains an inexact science.
