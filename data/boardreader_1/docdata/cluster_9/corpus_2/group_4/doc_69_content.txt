Tips are welcome                        I used to just take off in shorts a tee shirt and light jumper (warm winters here 0 to 5 deg C mornings only) and rip the jumper off after 10mins as I would be getting too hot. The less you wear the faster you want to get there   Tried wearing plastic rain coats an such when it was raining but found that there was no point to them as you would be drenched with sweat in no time anyway   as they don&amp;#039;t breathe, so in wet weather less is better. Just always have a dry clean set at the other end.
