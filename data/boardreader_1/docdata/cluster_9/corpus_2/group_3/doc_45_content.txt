Yeah, I got a dentist appointment at 2:55 and I don&amp;#039;t wanna go. It&amp;#039;s not that I&amp;#039;m scared of the dentist/tools and that it&amp;#039;s because it&amp;#039;s a waste of time, I&amp;#039;m only going for a sodding check up and I cba to go.   Anybody else hate having to go for check ups?
