                                                                   Here&amp;#039;s a question.    NOTE ~ This is complete speculation on my part.    1.  If the players are actually refusing to do certain things, can the club fine them?    2.  Does the CBA have any sort of rules on this sort of thing?    ps ~ I really can&amp;#039;t see any of the guys refusing to do anything.   I can see Roli bulling up because he wants to be the starter, but the rest of the gang doesn&amp;#039;t seem to be the type of guys who refuse.   Never know I guess.
