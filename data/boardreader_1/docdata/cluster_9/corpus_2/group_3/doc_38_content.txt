 Zimbabwe   City Gallery - Page 5 - SkyscraperCity SormShadow, the picture third photograph from the post &amp;amp;quot;Salisbuy, Rhodesia&amp;amp;quot; is not of Harare, but rather of Bulawayo, circa 1995-2000.  The blue roofed building in the foreground is the Josiah Tongogara brach of Barclays Bank (notice the ATM on the right side of the building).  ATM technology was available in Zimbabwe until the early 1990s.  This building previously had a silver roof on it, and was reroofed with the Blue when Barclays released its new corporate logo (3/4 eagle on circle) in the mid 1990s.  The white tower in the left midground is the clock tower on the Bulawayo City Hall.  Judging by the appearant consistent wear of long-sleeves by the people in the picture and the foliage on the trees the picture was taken in late March or early April.  The vehicles are definately late 1980&amp;#039;s to mid 1990&amp;#039;s models and relevant to the fact that at that time vehicles available in zimbabwe did not advance in models available in south africa or other countries.      Regardless, the pictures show a better time in the country and the extent to which Bob has ruined a once properous nation.
