 If it were possible, I&amp;#039;d trade for Eddy Curry, and give the Knickies their hometown boy in Joakim Noah. I&amp;#039;d even throw in a draft pick and soem fillers!  Curry isn&amp;#039;t any worst than Gray. I like Gray! And perhaps Curry will gain a motivation and will to play in better shape; he&amp;#039;d be a few steps away from Tim Glover. And, I doubt if he want to look as bad as he has in his hometown, for a 2nd time around. Before the heart issues curtailed his stay here, he had gotten in the best shape ever, and it was showing on t he court. He is what he is in terms of his defensive play. But, he can score in the paint on most centers.  :-)      That&amp;#039;s that silly &amp;quot;potential&amp;quot; label again. I&amp;#039;ve gone back and forth in my own mind regarding this. Hughes makes around the same amout of money as Curry, his contract runs up before Curry, and Donnie Walsh is looking to shed some contracts he inherited from Isiah. (when he wasn&amp;#039;t bankrupting the CBA or sexually harassing secretaries, God bless his smutty Chicago soul) I kind of am leaning towards re-acquiring Curry. He can&amp;#039;t play defense or rebound, although I do think he is a good passer. When he puts his butt into an opponents chest, he&amp;#039;s gonna score. Not many people can stop him when he&amp;#039;s on. But the one thing that kills me about Curry, more than anything he&amp;#039;s done in the pros; with his gorilla-like size and strength, he couldn&amp;#039;t beat Schaumberg for the state championship. I think that alone (even though it was in HS) shows his lack of heart. Maybe coming back home and playing with another Chicago boy on the team would do him good, but......
