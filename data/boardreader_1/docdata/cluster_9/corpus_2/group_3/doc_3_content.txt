As an alum, I would LOVE to see Afflalo somehow come to the Lakers, especially as our backcourt rotation could use one more player, at least for insurance purposes for the time being.        That being said:        (1)  Ariza NEVER PLAYED with Farmar and Afflalo at UCLA.  He bailed before Howland got there.        (2)  Afflalo is still on a rookie pay-scale.  There is NO WAY to trade Luke and Sun for him under the CBA.        MIM _________________ Lakers 2007-08 Injury Report:  Shot, &amp;amp;lt;bleep&amp;amp;gt;ed, powder-burned, and snakebit.
