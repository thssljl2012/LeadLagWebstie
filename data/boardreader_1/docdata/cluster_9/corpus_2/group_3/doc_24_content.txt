As such he&amp;#039;s going to be commish for a LONG time.             While he IS employed by the owners, he (and the owners)  WILL have to deal with him when the CBA comes up. Do you think the players are on his side right now ?? I&amp;#039;m thinking he&amp;#039;s NOT on their fav&amp;#039;s list right now. How long do you think this game will survive w/o a CBA ??? Just a thought....        However, I do agree with him handling the issues like Pacman, C-Henry, even B-Marsh...but I don&amp;#039;t see the ticky-tack fines making a good difference, even player like Polomu (sp?) have spoken up how it WILL have an bad impact on  the game.
