Heck, since I am asking -- can a Fodorite use a Santander ATM in Barcelona and report back?  Preferably one on Passeig de Gracia next to a Barclays?     But maybe that one is a Banesto.    So the only way I can be sure is to retrace my footsteps for that night.     Fodor&amp;#039;s editors, if you are reading this, can you fly me to Barcelona to find out?  I&amp;#039;ll take photos.
