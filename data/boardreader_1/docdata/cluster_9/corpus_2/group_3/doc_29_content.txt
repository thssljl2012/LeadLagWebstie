               They had to take a bribe to support their rock habbit?    The real umpires were killed and eaten and they were replaced by Philly fans?    The bus had an exhaust leak and all of them suffered perminent brain damage?    Their seeing eye dogs got in a fight and killed each other?    They hate Joe Madden&amp;#039;s glasses?       The point of the rule is to avoid biases. Either favoring one team from a series before, or not favoring one team because of the series before. I think it makes sense.        Thie clause was added into the CBA to allow more umpires to do big games. They benefit, we suffer.
