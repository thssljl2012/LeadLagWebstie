        QUOTE (*bluebutterfly* &amp;amp;#064; Oct 17 2008 9 27 PM)        Yvonne  Yeah if i lived in the same country as them and knew the language and everything i think i would be a major fangirl too but i dont think i would stalk them because everyone needs their privacy. But yeah just supporting in every other way excpet for harrassing them or something is okay. xD  That sounds cool yeah that would be good if he does take part but is it a thing only for the UK? If not then I dont know because he&amp;#039;s in Taiwan, but it sounds cool. If you know the email or something to his agency, actually no because they wont listen it&amp;#039;d be better to actually ask him himself. Yeah fan mail is a good idea to tell him. Because there&amp;#039;s no other way.  Before I didnt actually hate smoke and that but these few years I started to really hate it. Because my dad smokes and before i didnt mind it but yeah now i really do. Yeah one thing i hate is people who smoke too.  I think I&amp;#039;ve kinda gotten used to all the homework, recently i havent been doing anything on the weekend so i spend the first half of the day on the comp and then the night doing homework and TV and then sunday depends if i&amp;#039;ve done all my homework if not then i do it first then go on computer because i do it the other way round i know i wont get in time because i always panic that i wont get it done in time, lol. But now i plan it out i have time for the comp but on certain days. Yeah people do that in my year too and worst that they&amp;#039;re my friends because i dont like getting left alone all the time so sometimes if i have something to do i&amp;#039;ll do it but it&amp;#039;s nothing important or in for the next day or something then i&amp;#039;ll kinda join it but i know i should be something else but i wont be able to concentrate if they&amp;#039;re messing around anyway. Oh yeah&amp;amp;#33; That reminds i got another maths test&amp;amp;#33; But a stats one for monday but i find stats easier than core but i kinda understand them both now but i&amp;#039;m kinda a slow worker sso i take longer than the 2 girls im sat next to do a ques because they&amp;#039;re cleverer than me xD And I dont work with them because of that reason and i usually work by myself in maths since year 7 anyway. I always sit next to my friends but they used to work even slower, lol.  OMG&amp;amp;#33; How rude?&amp;amp;#33; Thats just stupid&amp;amp;#33; Did she look at you when you were doing the cleaning duty? if she did then how can she forget. She must be one of them people who forget things all the time but then it seems like it was planned or something but wth? why? And if it was her that trashed the teacher&amp;#039;s room and stole his chocolates then its like she wants attention or something or just causing trouble for the sake of it.  LOL, my sister is just a bit shorter than me but still I&amp;#039;m short, lol. How tall are you? I think i&amp;#039;m like 150cm.
