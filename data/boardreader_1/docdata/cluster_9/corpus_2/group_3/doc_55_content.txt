Rowan, I think the key is to work out your motivation. Why row in the first place? For me it&amp;#039;s primarily a way of staving off the effects of a sedentary life-style and it keeps me fit enough to be able to do the odd cycle tour, without having to do too many hours cycling around the boring Warwickshire countryside (yes, that&amp;#039;s duller than erging    ). To add a bit of interest and motivation I train to try to improve my times at various distances. I know that if I let CBA take over too many times it will be the start of the slippery slope to hell, so I almost always do something, even if it&amp;#039;s not the session originally planned.
