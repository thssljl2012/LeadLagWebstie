  Flight 2. Sat 12 Oct SQ460 SIN - KHI, B777-200, 9V-SRJ, 1535  1945 (7 hr 10 min flight time), Seat 52C         Again a great pre-selected seat choice. Aisle seat, row behind the bulkhead row, but 51 only has A and B so lots of legroom. Load factor low at about 60%.                   Older version of KrisFlyer with smaller screens. Frankly found it easier to use and worked flawlessly.  News was udated, although no cricket scores.        Meal was better  had a delicious Murgh tawa masala (indian style chicken), entree was a green bean salad with cooked potatos, tomato and turkey, cheese and crackers and ice cream.         Karachi Airport    Was not expecting anything special and it certainly didn&amp;#039;t deliver. Similar in age to the old-CMB wing. Followed the signs to trsansit, and found the decrepit transit lounge past some private airport vendors trying to sell all sorts of goods. Waited in the lounge about 2hrs or so until the CX reps showed up and issued my my new boarding card and reissued my baggage card on a CX slip (at least I knew it had arrived in KHI)         CIP Lounge KHI    Given an invite to the CIP lounge which seemed to be the only lounge (used by PIA, Emirates, Thai and Cathay), although there was also a Barclays lounge next door which looked nicer. The new CIP lounge had been re-opened in Aug-08.  Food offering minimal  some basic chicken or cheese sandwhiches, a few sweets treats, some crisps and a self-serve soft drink and juice fridge. Basic coffee and tea. No showers. No wifi although 8 PCs but connection excruciatingly slow  didn&amp;#039;t even load SMH frontpage.
