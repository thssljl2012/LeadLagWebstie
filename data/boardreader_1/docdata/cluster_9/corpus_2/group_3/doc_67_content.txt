I wonder if a petition to make the trophies retro active would get recognised?    doubt it       I wouldnt have to be posted all over the internet for it to stand any chance of working. But i suppose there may be enough people in the world that have completed it 100% already that dont really want to do it agai (me being one).    I know im not going to complete it again. Im not even going to start it again any time soon.         &amp;amp;nbsp;                Want to Rick Roll someone?
