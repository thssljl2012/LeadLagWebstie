Since Alfie is 35 years old, this new contract will stay on the books until it expires, regardless of what happens to Alfie. So if Alfie signs the deal, and another idiot Leaf plug takes a run at him, ending his career, the Senators are stuck with the cap hit until 2013. It&amp;#039;s a bit or a risk, but one I&amp;#039;m sure the Sens don&amp;#039;t mind taking with the face of the franchise.    Are you sure this is true?  I thought that applies to arbitrary retirement, but in terms of a critical injury, teams can get around it with LTIR (like New Jersey did with one or two players).
