          Yeah, Dead Space came out today, EA wanted to remind me today instead of beforehand so I could pre-order it. I will be buying that one, but now I think I&amp;#039;ll wait a little while before ordering it, have enough on my plate as it is.  As for Halloween, it&amp;#039;s another American thing that we&amp;#039;ve adopted, never really been into it myself and cba to change my AV/sig right now.         &amp;amp;nbsp;
