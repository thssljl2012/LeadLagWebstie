 A few years ago I was on holiday in Switzerland and took a day trip to Italy. We went to a place called Stresa on the edges of Lake Maggiore where there are a number of small islands. I went on a boat trip to aforementioned islands where I lost my wallet (100 Euros, bank cards etc.)  . After I realised, I went back and got hunting to try and find it but had no luck. So I went through the crap of cancelling cards, parents wired me money (you can get western union at any Swiss rail station, v. useful!) and it was all ok.    Roll on around a month later I get a small package through the mail. Open it to a big OMG, there is my wallet! Turns out some Greek guy had picked it up, taken it home, taken 20 euros for postage/his troubles (fair enough) and mailed it to Barclays. They destroyed my bank cards (cancelled anyway) and mailed it on to me with the cash and the rest back. Amazing the kindness of strangers eh!
