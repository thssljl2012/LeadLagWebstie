 Hello Nuker85,      Thanks for your response, unfortunately I already have implemented the layout layout variant switch observer.Even though I&amp;#039;m disabling the current CBA in this callback, it is still shown while the display is rotated.      It is not clear to me when the HandleResourcechangeL is invoked, before or after actual roation takes place. So currently I&amp;#039;m still a bit stuck with that flashing empty CBA...
