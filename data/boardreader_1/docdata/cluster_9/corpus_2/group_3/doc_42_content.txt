                    G11 at i35                                          ADVERTISEMENT:                          OK considering I&amp;#039;m now typing from a g15 i have my old g11 (blue LED) for sale.    It&amp;#039;s condition is fairly decent, however its missing one of the clips from underneath and the wrist rest doesn&amp;#039;t connect properly as the clips are gone aswell.     The keys are 100% working as is the media selection etc on it.    I only want 5 for this so I cba post it and no box. but if anyone wants i&amp;#039;ll bring it to i35      SOOOLLLLLLLDDDD!
