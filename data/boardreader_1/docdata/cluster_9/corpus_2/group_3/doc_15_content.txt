   I think i&amp;#039;ve said whats up to you once before, but I was riding my bike and saw what I think was an OC fixed shirt in white at CSULB near CBA, I couldn&amp;#039;t tell exactly if it was because your backpack was covering it.  I nodded to you, wasn&amp;#039;t sure if you saw me.   Me: Celeste Pista Concept
