 I decided to sleep in a little and rest up after the long day, since I had only evening appointments today.  Gotta rest to grow!  Chest is feeling larger and sore today, woot, woot!!    The morning and afternoon though was jam-packed with wedding planning though.  Jeff and Clint from Max Muscle also met with me this afternoon to work on some details on the Buckeye Classic.  Today, I was officially announced as THE trainer for Nationwide Insurance&amp;#039;s Wellness Center as a partnership with Metro Fitness.  At 2pm, the announcement went out to their 4500 Wellness Center members.  By this evening I had 14 emails and 3 voicemails.    I am about to get busier!      KILLER BACK ATTACK 9/30:      I forced myself away from wedding planning for this killer back workout.  This was the last of my first week back, so the intensity will be going up from here.  The last three moves I only did 2 sets cuz it was already killing.  I train back with hard squeezed, controlled negative and exaggerated stretches.    T-Bar Rows 90 x 10, 100 x 9 x 8  High Pulley Medium-Grip Underhand Rows 70 x 13, 75 x 11 x 10  Wide-Grip Pulldowns 150 x 11 x 9  Close-Grip Chins BW x 9 x 7  Seated Cable Rows 150 x 13, 160 x 10
