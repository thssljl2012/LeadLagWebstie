Might hurt a bit, but it&amp;#039;s not gonna kill you.  It has about the power of a low-powered BB gun.  But, with a bullet being bigger, you have more surface area, less PSI pressure, so it isn&amp;#039;t going to penetrate.  Maybe 250-400 FPS at the most, depending on the weight to surface area ratio.  To put that into perspective...  An M16 can shoot a .223 round at about 3200fps.  This is 2,182mph.  400fps = only 273mph, which a .223 round can&amp;#039;t probably even reach that terminal velocity speed because of it&amp;#039;s little weight (40-60grain).  And, with cross-winds, you get tumbling effect with decreases the speed even more.         400 fps is a little over 270 miles an hour, as you pointed out.  And if a small chunk of lead hits you at that speed, it&amp;#039;s going to do more than chip your tooth or get your eye good.  I&amp;#039;m willing to bet I could knock one of your teeth out or bloody your head simply throwing a bullet by hand, and I certainly can&amp;#039;t throw at 200 mph.     If you google the news, you&amp;#039;ll find numerous incidents where falling bullets have penetrated when they hit, and some have done serious damage.  And you have to remember that most bullets aren&amp;#039;t fired straight up; they&amp;#039;re fired at an angle, and many retain ballistic speed until they hit the ground.
