 What kills me is that people are preaching patience and look to the long term. Why? Isn&amp;#039;t one playoff appearance in 15 years enough patience? This organziation failed to sieze the moment, and it&amp;#039;s starting to show. You can&amp;#039;t guarentee that moves made will work out in the long term as people get hurt, coaches change, other teams improve, etc...  Look at past champions. The Celtics obtained Garnett for their championship last year and the Lakers obtained Gasol for their run to the Finals.The Spurs added 6 new players to their 2007 Champsionship team, in addition to guys like Finley, Barry, Horry, and Bowen who were not drafted by them. The Heat obtained Shaq and won the title in 2006. The Pistons obtained Rasheed Wallace for their title run.  Good teams do not trade valuable parts away, they add to them. Sure sometimes they have to give up something of value to obtain the player they want, but they all make sure they get the BEST player in the deal at the time. I can tell you that in the Richardson deal, the best player was Jason Richardson. Please quit trying to say that the team would not be able to have Ellis, Biedrins, and Azubuike on the team with Richardson still around. The one thing the CBA does well is it allows for teams to re-sign their own players. If the team wanted to keep it&amp;#039;s core together, it could easily do so. The team even could have signed Turiaf or someone of his ilk by using their mid-level exception.  Bottom line is after this team made the Playoffs in 2007, they have begun to take steps backwards while throwingout the phrase &amp;quot;looking to the future&amp;quot;. However to win a championship in this league, you need to focus on the present.
