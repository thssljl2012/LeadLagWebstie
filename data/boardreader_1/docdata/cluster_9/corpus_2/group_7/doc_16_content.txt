Especially north would have been perfect, moreso back then, there was nothing up there! I remember when we used to drive from the TC to Duluth, I would get freaked out when I would stop at rest areas, thinking that if anyone wanted to do anything to me there would be no witnesses. I'm probably a weirdo but I would always wonder if any bodies were ever dumped up there... who knows when it would be found. There is a lot of empty space up that way.     But, perhaps this guy went to Wisconsin because he was from there. I think a lot of these guys to where they are familiar with the area. This guy must have known of an area that was secluded, though maybe he should have chosen somewhere that would not have made him get so out of breath.       fwiw I don't think he staged it either. I don't really know what the benefit would be. Maybe at the time people didn't like him but when I worked for Wells Fargo 6 years ago my boss had worked at US Bank under Grundhofer and she praised him, saying he completely turned that company around.
