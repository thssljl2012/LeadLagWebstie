MLS now has Kansas City and Philadelphia building new stadiums, DC United and Houston very close to finalizing their projects, New York moves into their palace in 2010, and San Jose has been trying to get something worked out for quite some time now. That leaves New England as the only team not seriously making waves with regard to a stadium. All of those new stadiums means a lot more revenue for the teams and for the league.     The CBA negotiations will be taking place this year. Even though the CBA does not directly affect the salary cap, that is going to be the biggest thing everyone is going to be talked about. New York is going to be among those pushing for $5 million, but we can't expect Garber and co. to budge that much. $3.5 mil is certainly a possibility.     If they make the salary cap, basically 150% of what it is now with bigger increases, and tons more revenue with so many revenue-controlled stadiums (Qwest and FIU for a possible Miami stadium), as well as an ever-expanding league, those "funds" are coming.
