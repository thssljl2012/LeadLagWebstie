Just different from what you are used to   One thing we have a lot is "cases" (?), for example      tiede = science   tieteen   tiedett   tieteen   tieteeksi   tieteess   tieteest   tieteeseen   tieteell   tieteelt   tieteelle   tieteett   tieteineen   tietein      I cba to make example lines of them to translate. Constructing new words is easy and basically you can make infinitely long words in Finnish using suffixes (not that they mean anything sensible anymore thou). Somewhere it was said that this is the longest word that has been in use (I guess it's too long for the forum because it adds a space there  )      lentokonesuihkuturbiinimoottoriapumekaanikkoaliups  eerioppilas      Pronouncingwise Finnish has to be one of the easiest languages in the world. Basically it's just read as it's written. Although I suppose it's hard to pickup for english speakers because of double (long) vowels and consonants and maybe some other things.      If you are interested in languages, goto  http://wals.info/       Oh yeah, japs are crazy                      Haha, we have an English version of that. In English, however, our long complicated words are based in Latin, and aren't spoken and basically used in just doctoral-paper-land, or  PhD MD land.      There's so much stupid controversy over it (not mainstream mind you, behind the nerd English scenes). Here's the wikipidia on it, you won't learn any damn English from it though:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English       edit: to be honest, I grew up always thinking this was our longest real word:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidis...shmentarianism  and I bet a lot of people here that grew up in North America would agree.
