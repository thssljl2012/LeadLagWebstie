Most of the veteran cuts usually occur in May or June when there's a chance for a friendlier cap hit.             That was one CBA ago.  The current CBA adjusted for that, allowing teams to cut players earlier while still applying the previous "June 1st cuts" rule, and giving players a better chance of signing with a team early enough to participate in all workouts/meetings/and have a generally better chance of making a positive impact on the team. _________________          Thanks to RustyNail for the sig.
