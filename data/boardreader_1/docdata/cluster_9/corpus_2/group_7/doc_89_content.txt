I've already got a laptop. Stop tempting me   You can sell it though, for say 1.1k. You could get something cool like an erm..    erm..    Air rifle?  or a normal macbook  , mmuch better than an air      Yeah!    But air rifle.    Think about it    Get...    1) MacBook Air  2) Sell For 1.1k  3) Buy Air Rifle for about 200 l  4) Rob store  5) ????  6) Profit.     Sounds like a plan, though i have a few suggestions. Firstly i would hire you to do it but instead of payig you in money i would give you not 1, not 2, not 3, not even 4, but 5 magic beans! Obviously i would supply you with the weapon. An air rifle is too expensive, how about a spud gun? That means even more profit! Instead of a store we could rob a bank. then I could profit and you'd have 5 magic beans   Tempting...    Sweeten the deal.    Fine. You get to keep the spuds    I need something for lunch and a method of transport.    Yet again the whole thing is off topic. Plus are we trying to make a huge super quote?    No.      batman653 wrote:   james1994 wrote:   batman653 wrote:   james1994 wrote:   batman653 wrote:   james1994 wrote:   batman653 wrote:   CheezyBurger- wrote:   batman653 wrote:   james1994 wrote:   batman653 wrote:   james1994 wrote:   batman653 wrote: Yeah but you could sell the MacBook for quite a bit.
