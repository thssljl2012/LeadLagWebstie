Interesting...      Bank of America execs. just spent 10 million at the super bowl on parties..box suites at the game...concerts..drinks...etc...         Morgan Stanley just spent a few million on a 3 day retreat in Palm Springs at a 5 star resort...         GM....well kudos to them...they sent nobody to the Super Bowl at all even though they were contracted to be a sponser
