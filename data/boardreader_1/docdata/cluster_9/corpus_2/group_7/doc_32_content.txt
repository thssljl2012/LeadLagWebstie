But what really takes the piss a step to far the highest insult to the English is a controversial  British day  proposed by this goverment.                      Shakespeare is the best known  playwright  and surely youmean  Robert Burns?  British day? Well the UK government won't entertain the idea of St George's day as a Bank holiday because they are terrified of undermining the union by stoking English nationalism. I agree British day is rubbish although I do actually agree with the union, I would say allow the English to celebrate who we are, it will not separate us from the Scots.
