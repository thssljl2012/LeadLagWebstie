 I do agree about the timing and yes it would be nice to have an extra day in October instead, but I thought it would be a nice gesture to my staff for a day off.  If I could think of a day to celebrate in October I might do that instead next year .... any ideas? Wasn't Trafalgar Day mooted at some point in the past few years?
