      Hey, Going try and make this my final topic,  I recently got scammed on my Zerker pure and my basically maxed tank,  My Pure;    My Tank;    I was going for barrows gloves on Z Fury Elf, and i got 20 qp away and thought i would have a break, so i managed to save up for BGS and thought i'd go pking etc... But no, i got hacked but idk how.    I got scammed on my Maxed Tank too, dropped all my capes, etc and fletched my money and traded it somehow,   so really cba with RS anymore, I'm 17 i feel now is the right time to quit, I might come on once in a while to see how d2 is going and post aound see what your up to etc,  Cya    ~N  R  P
