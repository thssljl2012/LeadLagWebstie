 Must admit i really enjoy driving around on St Georges day , go two 5x3 St George cross flags i fly on the car - not to mention the 6x4 one on the flag pole at the bottom of my garden.   St Georges day should be a national holiday along with a parade , but the pc brigade will have a cow and scream 'racist' , they mite as well say we fell from the sky and shout 'heretics'  time to be burnt at the stake.
