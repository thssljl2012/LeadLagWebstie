 The water's kind of cold there now, isn't it?  Gonna take a vacation to someplace warm or just try it out in the bath tub?  8^P   Let us know what you think of it.  I considered one of the W series when I got my wife's little Panasonic DMC-FS3 so we could take it on the boat.  Instead of the W I bought a bigger boat to keep the camera dry.
