Yes, but he wasn't traded until the second day of the draft, which gave the Pats time to fly Moss out for a physical and discuss contracts. Hard to do that during round one.

The rookie cap is based on the draft picks you  use , not the players you end up with. The only reason the Sheli-Rivers trade worked was because the cap allotments for slots 1 and 4 were close enough to make it palatable.
