   Under the CBA what Alex admitted to was not against the rules in 2001-2003. Yes, I am aware that it was against the law. The Union would fight Bud with everything they have if he tries to punish Alex.  That idiot finally comes out of his coma after 5 days and makes a complete @$$ of himself. He sounds as coherent as a drugged up mental pateint.   You would think for 20 million dollars, he would actually know what he was talking about or have an articulate statement planned in advance.   He should be fired IMMEDIATELY.
