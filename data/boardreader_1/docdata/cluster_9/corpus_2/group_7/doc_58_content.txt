     Bud is an idiot. Like SS said, he would have to release the other names.   And rememeber,it wouldnt be 100+ different names, it would be less than that cuz some guys failed twice. It is 100+ fails, not names.    i dont think thats true.    It isn't. There was only one test in 2003 that I am aware of. They tested everyone to see what the extent of the problem was. If it was more than 5% that tested positive (and it was) then testing (with penalties) would be added the next year to the CBA.   According to Al Leiter who was tested, it is true. They were tested twice sothe same guy could have failed twice.   as i understand it, every player was tested twice by 2 different companies. this is why there were names associated with the tests, so the companies would compare their results and 2 positives would be a failure. so, in the end, 100+ had failures from both companies.
