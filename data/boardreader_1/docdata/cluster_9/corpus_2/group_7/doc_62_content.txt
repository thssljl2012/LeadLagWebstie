Even though it wasn't tested for, Fay Vincent went out of his way to place a ban on Steriods in 91, stating that all drugs used without a legal prescription was not legal in baseball. So everyone who used anything between 91 and 03 are still subject to suspension, ban or worse if Selig wishes to exercise a little "Best Interests of Baseball" power.     its not that simple.     even though it was illegal..there were no terms set in place in the CBA about what happens to offenders.  Effectively, nothing could be done until '04, when they finally set a procedure in dealing with users.       You can't go further back then that, and apply penalties to an action done before the penalties were set in place.      Exactly.  And the players union certainly wouldn't let it happen.  Not simple whatsoever.  Its not like bud has absolute power.  He might be able to alter a few record books, but thats about it.
