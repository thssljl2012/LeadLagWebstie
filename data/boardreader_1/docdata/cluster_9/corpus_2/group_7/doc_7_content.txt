      Excuse me while I interrupt your paean to the second-best team in town for breaking your heart, but I'll refocus this onto football (you know, the purpose of these boards     ).        The salary cap could go down in 2010, if the CBA is renegotiated.  In exchange for a salary cap reduction and the addition of a rookie scale, this would mean more money for vets (raise the salary floor and *bang*, guys who have spent their time in the league get paid).
