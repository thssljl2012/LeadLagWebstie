 Those who actually sit down and think about this will realise what a rubbish idea it is. There are plenty of bank holidays at this time of year - in fact it's only a week or two after easter if it's late and just before before mayday. It might be better to fix easter on 23rd (doubt the Christians would agree mind) and have an extra bank holiday for the October half term (or similar) as there are no bank holidays in the four months between August and Christmas.
