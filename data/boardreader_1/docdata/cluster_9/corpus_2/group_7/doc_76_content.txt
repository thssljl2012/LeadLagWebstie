QUOTE(eric t &#064; Feb 5 2009, 09:08 AM)   I think shannan has a punches chance, crazy kim dropped him, mundines chin doesn't look as strong at this weight and his punches don't, and shannan is the type of unpredictable puncher that could cause a upset so mundine has to be careful, he ko'd a guy who went 12 with tszyu in 3 rounds or something so you never know what rabbit he will pull out of the hat. Shannan might be able to last 12 if his new trainer got him moving his head and improved his footwork. I think if he just covers up like he normally does mundine will consistantly put his punches together and might break him down and stop him.           Here are the facts, Eric.  Taylor is SHOT.   Mosley ruined Taylor's chin and he has been stunned and stoppedo n numerous occasions since. Taylor resorts to fouls when he gets frustrated or is losing a fight; a DQ here is a very real possibility. The only reason Taylor continues to fight is because his former promoter Tony Caradonna stole all of his money.  Caradonna is currently in jail awaiting charges of defrauding the ANZ bank of millions of dollars after forging the title deed to the Rebel motorcycle gang's club house.  Mundine will be looking to make a statement in his first fight at middleweight ahead of a likely shot at WBA titleholder Felix Sturm in July.                                ...
