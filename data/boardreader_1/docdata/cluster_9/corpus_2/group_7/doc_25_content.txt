Don't forget all rules as far as OTA's, what/how many offseason workouts can be had, team disciplinary fines, etc... can be levied. All these issues will now be totally up to the owners, either collectively or individually. How many players would really benifit from no cap versus how many are going to be hurt by all the other stuff.    Players may view this as a huge cash cow coming, but there are a lot of other aspects in the agreement that they will not be very happy to loose. Same old story,    "Be Careful What You Wish For. You just might get it"                         From what i have read it has nothing to do with the college players per say.  It was a negotiated piece in the collective bargaining agreement for the placement of talent.  Had it not been there, teams could go and sign whoever, and pay whatever.  I will go and see if I can find that source I read again.  But I am almost positive that i read if the CBA is gone...so is the draft and cap and tags and all that such is gone.
