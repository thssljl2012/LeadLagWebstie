     I do agree with you partly j-zone... I do think Selig had a grasp of some of them roid use... but I dont think he thought it was this big.   Ah bullcrap. He knew what was going on all along. The MLBPA is just too strong for a wimp like Selig. They wouldn't approve testing as part of the CBA for years. And Bud just folded like a cheap suit.  Bud knew what was going on. He's as much a part of this as the players and Fehr are.
