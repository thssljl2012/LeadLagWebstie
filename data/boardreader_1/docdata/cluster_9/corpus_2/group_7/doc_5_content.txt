T1-T3 is okay, but still needs improvements to oRvR, but T4 is just a joke in my opinion.     Almost wish I hadent played Daoc before WAR, because then I wouldent know any better and actually be sattesfied ;D     Don't even want people not haveing played Daoc arguing with me about this tbh ;D     Others can say that Im wrong and why tho.     Would have stated in more detail why I think this, but as Im off to sleep now I cba, will have to wait for tomorrow ;D     When and if DAOC Origins gets here, it's bye bye WAR tbh, atleast until and if it gets to a point where it meets my expectations
