Teams can't act like the Yankees, Red Sox, Celtics, and Lakers and just pay a luxury tax on amounts over the cap.      All contracts must be approved by the league before they are finalized.  Such approval includes examining whether or not the contract puts a team over the cap.  If it does the contract won't be approved.      If a team goes into the next year over the cap, they can't sign anyone else until they are under the cap.  I don't believe it matters if the team has less than 51 players under contract either.  This also includes rookies that they can draft, but can't sign.      Now, after all that, if a team goes into a year over the cap, but doesn't sign anyone and just stays with that roster,  I don't believe (but I'm not 100% sure) that the NFL starts invalidating contracts.         What I think happens at the end of the year is that any amount the team is over the salary cap from a previous year is deducted from their salary cap the following year.  I also think the team may be fined or have draft picks taken away by the commissioner.                      Bav, just looking for a clarification here... I'm pretty sure the NFL would start invalidating contracts. Was this a typo or do you believe they would NOT invalidate contracts ?      The big problem with invalidating contracts is that it might not actually be possible because many contracts would have a bigger cap hit by being invalidated. I remember an article regarding the Redskins that said had the new CBA not been signed, their was no mathematical way for them to get under the cap regardless of which or how many contracts were invalidated.
