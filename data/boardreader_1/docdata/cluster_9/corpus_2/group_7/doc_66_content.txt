No, if we renounce Marion we still have the same cap space to sign someone else or make a trade to take back the salary.    E.g. if it is true that the Jefferson and Carter are on the block at firesale prices (apparently Jefferson more than Carter), we might be able to swing something like JKap    / S&amp;T of Parker + pics galore for Carter . Or we might be able to do something similar for Jefferson using Hump.  I've not checked either trade, but these are extreme examples (and highly improbable).  Think: Marcus Camby for 2nd round draft pick type of deal.  At the end of the day, Marion's contract will be determined by the market.  On the plus side, there are very few good buyers out there (see Fairview's post).  I don't think Marion will accept a $10-12m salary for 4 or less years (even $10m at age 35 makes me cringe), but if he comes on board for that amount, I'd view it as a good signing.  That's all we have under the lux tax after bringing back Parker and Graham (by my math and estimates), so keep your fingers crossed!
