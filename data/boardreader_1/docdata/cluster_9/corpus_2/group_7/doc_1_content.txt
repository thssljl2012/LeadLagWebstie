      So i ended up going to some random concert yesterday, i asked the bouncer if its ok to shoot there, he said yes. While i was changing lens sitting on bench where they sold theyr records the manager had came there while i was taking pics, then he told me if i get some good shgots he might want to buy some pic and gave his e-mail adress     . There was really dark in there, so dark i couldnt get a good shot on the first singer(there was 4 bands that we listened to first 3). Im going to shit in my pants if he pays even small sum from some pic.  Enyways heres one pic from every performer. I think ill post more later, if someone wants to see some originals, i can show u how much i had to photoshop for them to look even desent  This was probably the best pic from the first singer, from his quitarist i got few good ones, but i cba to edit more now       From the second artist i didnt get meny good shots or they looked alot like this, but i think this one came out ok, could fine tune the colors tho      This post was edited by Antichrist- on Sat, Jan 31 2009, 08:04am
