 Offshore Sportsbooks &amp; Online Sports Picks            Billy      I see several decent games, but none that are overwhelming.      Phx and Hou are both tempting.  Phx 3 straight games over 140.  Of the two I'd play Phx.  Bos has looked mortal without KG.      I like Mich St.  I played a teaser with Mich St and Arz St. (Mich St-3, Arz St-2).      Financial news today looked at the fact both Citibank and Bank of America are upside down.  Depressing stuff.      I'm in Calif and its 10 AM here.....so I'm not done.  I'll be back within 1 hour.  Hopefully with 1 big play.
