Please no flaming here...  Im furloughed from RAH on the 175 and not expecting recall in the next 6 months so Im "considering" Compass. I only have 6 months of seniority at RAH so giving that up really isnt a big deal.  My questions: anywhere I can read or find out about the CBA, QoL is everything to me, I know DTW is junior base but whats the "timeline" for getting into MSP? Any word of more bases on the west coast (SLC communter)? How are the schedules?   Like every regional, I know there is a downside, what are the top complaints (again, please dont just Compass bash, esp if you dont work there)?  Thanks
