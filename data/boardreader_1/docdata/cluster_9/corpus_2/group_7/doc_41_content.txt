Now since I have these mods will it make tuning it a bit cheaper for stage 2 since i have a Cat back exhaust?                       a catback and a downpipe IS stage 2 and you should get tuned immediately after those modifications. if its not within your financial ability right now to get a tune, you need to hold off on doing your mods until its within budget.      also,   skip out on the BOV
