        QUOTE (nobody &#064; Feb 19 2009, 01:53 PM)       This is why the current CBA is a joke.    Absolutely!  Average players are getting all pro money, which in turn raises the bar for all pro money and it just spins out of control.  This is happening again to hockey as well, I can see another lock out in the near future.
