My aunty was luckily in Melbourne yesterday so she stayed there last night. My uncle stayed at their house instead of evacuating and luckily their house is one of only about 10 which survived. Apparently the entire town is destroyed. All of their neighbours houses are destroyed and my uncles best friends son and wife are dead.     That is horrible
