I have extra cash from selling my last winter car and I am going to use it on my new 04 wrx. my plan is as follows      CBA Apexi N1 EXTI      Cobb downpipe      Perring Uppipe      K&amp;N CAI      HKS BOV      Later after I save up a bit more id like to take a trip down to get my wrx Cobb stage2.  Now since I have these mods will it make tuning it a bit cheaper for stage 2 since i have a Cat back exhaust?      My next list would follow as...      IHI VF34      STI 565cc injectors      Warlbro 255lph pump      Any suggestions and does anyone know of places i can find used parts for cheaper prices or else this will run me over 4,000 with new parts.
