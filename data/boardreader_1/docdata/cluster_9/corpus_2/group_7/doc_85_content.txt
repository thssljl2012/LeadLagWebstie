They knew players were using, and they allowed this all to happen because they were getting rich off of it.  Then, when it became convenient to do so -- which, not coincidentally, was during the negotiation period of the CBA -- management turned on the players and held them up to shame in order to get public sympathy for their side of the CBA deal, because they know it works.                      I'm not about to throw innocent players under the bus for mere suspicion of PED use, so let's apply the same standard to management.  We've heard rumors of "leaded" and "unleaded" drinks on the training table, but until there's some proof, management should be innocent until proven guilty.  (And once there is proof, I'll be the first to burn the guilty party.)

Even if  every  player was using illegal PEDs, that wouldn't make it right.              Quote:                         ...Just knowing anything about how incentives work would lead one to conclude that thousands upon thousands of players have used over the past four decades, at all levels of the game.                     And that's based on what?              Quote:                         But that's too nuanced for some people to contemplate, and too difficult for Baseball to confront.  So the likely course of action will be to draw a clear line between Good and Evil, cast a few super-talented players into the abyss as a sacrifice to the gods, and declare the Game cleaned up.  Then, as a postscript, act surprised when it comes up again a few years later.                     I'm not advocating how MLB has behaved throughout this ordeal.  The subject now is how to fix the mess.  Denying Hall of Fame entry to  any player guilty of using PEDs  seems reasonable.              Quote:                         Because football players are physical freaks.  Same with basketball players.  And hockey players have a specific freaky skill few others can replicate, plus they're mostly foreigners.  So we place them in their own special categories and regard them from across a distant chasm most of us can't cross.  So their behavior is that of "the other", because we can't really identify with them all that well.      But  everyone  has played baseball -- men and women, boys and girls, old and young, so we think we understand that game better.  And baseball players are roughly our size, so we identify with them much more.  They don't seem at all like freaks.  So we hold them to a much higher standard.  That will not change during our lifetimes.                     Do players of other sports gain entry into the  Baseball  Hall of Fame?              Quote:                         Interesting.  See, I put Pete Rose's sins in a completely different category.  He engaged in behavior that undermined the integrity of the competition itself.  While no proof of this ever came out, it's not a stretch to believe that at some point in his career, Rose probably cheated to fail so he could win a bet.  On that basis alone, Pete Rose should be kept out of the Hall.      Gambling on games in which you participate is a much, much worse sin than taking steroids, contrary to what Jayson Stark would have you believe.  Stark has actually maintained that A-Rod's steroid sin is worse than the sin of the 1919 Black Sox, but there's a simple reason why it's not: The Black Sox cheated to lose.  A-Rod cheated to win.                     But they both cheated.  And I doubt Rose ever threw a game to win a bet.  More likely, he tried hard - too hard - to win games that he bet on his team to win.  The downside of that is allowing the money riding on the game to dictate coaching decisions.  Stuff like overworking a bullpen staff.              Quote:                         Secondly, funny you're talking about striking Bonds' number from the record books...                     On this, we agree.  You can't undo what's been done.  Bonds hit more balls over the outfield wall.  More than Ruth.  More than Aaron.  The number is undeniable.  But that doesn't mean we have to  celebrate  the guys that broke federal laws to gain an unfair advantage while playing the game.  The Hall of Fame is intended to highlight the best aspects of baseball.  It's not a library.  It's a cathedral.  MLB should treat it as such and keep those that have brought shame  to the game  out of the Hall.      Okay, that's my last respond-to-every-quote post.
