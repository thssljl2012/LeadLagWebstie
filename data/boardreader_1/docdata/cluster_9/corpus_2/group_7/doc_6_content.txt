The only way to gain true immortality in the form of being remembered purely as a baseball player for generations and generations is to be a undeniable true all-time great: Cobb, Ruth, Gehrig, Williams, Musial, Mays, Aaron, etc.  Frankly, very few casual fans know of Carl Hubbell or Eddie Collins or Johhny Mize or Billy Hamilton - and those guys were really, really great players - crazy good players - they are well above the average HOF player in terms of quality of career.  Does anyone really think casual fans are going to remember Rafael Palmerio 20 years from now if he is put in the Hall?                      Actually, I think a lot more good-to-great players from this era will be remembered more than from Hubbell's era because of the ubiquity of recent game footage and the increased sophistication of and access to record-keeping.  In Hubbell's day, once a game was over, it was forgotten.  Now you can replay entire recent seasons on your computer or DVD from now until Christ comes again.  So yeah, I definitely believe people will remember the 10th to 50th best players of this era way more than people remember the 10th to 50th best players of the Depression era.

The fact MLB did not test is more about the strength of the players union and the specifics of the bargaining agreement than about management condoning steroid use.      At the end of the day, it's still my belief that a minority of players used PEDs.  They chose to thwart MLB rules and to break the law as these are controlled substances and illegal to possess.  (And this is a different brand of cheating than scuffing a ball or corking a bat - you're not breaking the law and risking jail time when slathering Vaseline under the visor of your cap.)  These players  knew  what they were doing was illegal in every sense of the word and chose to do it anyway.  Not being eligible for the Hall of Fame is a lot better fate than they deserve considering their professional behavior  should  have them prosecuted for fraud.  They knowingly lied about the product they provided to the consumers.                      First of all, it's easy to blame players and their union alone for perpetrating the evil -- but management were not unwitting dupes in all this.  They knew players were using, and they allowed this all to happen because they were getting rich off of it.  Then, when it became convenient to do so -- which, not coincidentally, was during the negotiation period of the CBA -- management turned on the players and held them up to shame in order to get public sympathy for their side of the CBA deal, because they know it works.      Secondly, you may believe players who used are a minority, and technically they may be, but they're not a tiny minority, as though the efforts of thousands have been sullied by The Dirty Dozen, led by Bad Guy Bonds.  Just knowing anything about how incentives work would lead one to conclude that thousands upon thousands of players have used over the past four decades, at all levels of the game.  But that's too nuanced for some people to contemplate, and too difficult for Baseball to confront.  So the likely course of action will be to draw a clear line between Good and Evil, cast a few super-talented players into the abyss as a sacrifice to the gods, and declare the Game cleaned up.  Then, as a postscript, act surprised when it comes up again a few years later.

It's the hall of fame, not the hall of morality.      How come nobody cares about football players that use PEDs?                      Because football players are physical freaks.  Same with basketball players.  And hockey players have a specific freaky skill few others can replicate, plus they're mostly foreigners.  So we place them in their own special categories and regard them from across a distant chasm most of us can't cross.  So their behavior is that of "the other", because we can't really identify with them all that well.      But  everyone  has played baseball -- men and women, boys and girls, old and young, so we think we understand that game better.  And baseball players are roughly our size, so we identify with them much more.  They don't seem at all like freaks.  So we hold them to a much higher standard.  That will not change during our lifetimes.

There is no possible way to be 100% sure they didn't.  I say they have to be allowed in or the HOF is a sham just like the whole steroid era is.  If it's based on numbers and numbers alone, then they have to be in.  Same for Pete Rose. (as a player).                      Interesting.  See, I put Pete Rose's sins in a completely different category.  He engaged in behavior that undermined the integrity of the competition itself.  While no proof of this ever came out, it's not a stretch to believe that at some point in his career, Rose probably cheated to fail so he could win a bet.  On that basis alone, Pete Rose should be kept out of the Hall.      Gambling on games in which you participate is a much, much worse sin than taking steroids, contrary to what Jayson Stark would have you believe.  Stark has actually maintained that A-Rod's steroid sin is worse than the sin of the 1919 Black Sox, but there's a simple reason why it's not: The Black Sox cheated to lose.  A-Rod cheated to win.           Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Canon Fodder                         How do you know which guy walking down the street is a murderer?  You don't.  You just assume the innocent folks are walking around and all the convicts are caught and punished.  All you can do is assume people are innocent until proven otherwise.  We know some people get away with the occasional crime but we don't let all the other criminals out so it's all fair.  I'm not advocating  barring  McGwire and Sosa from the Hall.  (I think they used but there's no  evidence  of such.)  Let the writers and powers-that-be vote.      However, we  know  A-Rod and Palmeiro used because they were caught.  Bonds and A-Rod both admitted using PEDs.  Can we just make the guys that got caught or admitted using ineligible from the Hall of Fame?  These guys cheated to be better at the game and to get  into  the Hall of Fame.  It's as if people want to reward them with what they were cheating to obtain in the first place.  Do the authorities hand stolen loot back to convicted bank robbers?      I don't want to void A-Rod's contract or strike Bonds' numbers from the record books, but do we have to celebrate these  known and admitted  cheaters right alongside people like Tony Gwynn and Greg Maddux?                      Firstly, yes, you don't know which guy walking down the street is a murderer.  (Actually, whenever I'm in a crowded ballpark, I frequently wonder how many of the 40,000 people there killed a guy, as a civilian.  I'll bet it's in the dozens.)  But the difference with baseball is the proximity, culture and numbers involved.  If 25% of all players take steroids, sure, you're gonna legitimately wonder about which 25% of the players are using, and take steps to monitor 100% of them.  Few civilians have ever been engaged in a murder (far, far south of 1%) and don't live in a culture where murder is common, so you wouldn't normally suspect a guy on the street in any case, and take steps to investigate 100% of citizens on suspicion of murder.      Secondly, funny you're talking about striking Bonds' number from the record books, because that is  exactly  what Bud Selig is reported to be contemplating today:       http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/29149415/       Which is such a bad idea on so many levels, I don't even know where to begin.  I'll post something once someone starts that thread.
