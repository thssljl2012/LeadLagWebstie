   Wow, you'd better hope that the prevailing winds at Citibank/TaxpayerTheft Mutt Park aren't blowing out. But I suppose if the place is a homer haven, it will simply be because of the tremendous pop in the bats of the immortal Mutts.   You do know the Phillies' splits for home runs on the road and at home were pretty much identical, right?
