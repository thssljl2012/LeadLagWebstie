 Hull manager Phil Brown has confirmed the Barclays Premier League newcomers have made a bid for Wigan striker Marlon King.The 28-year-old scored one goal in 15 games for the Latics after joining from Watford for 5million in the January transfer window.Brown told the Hull Daily Mail: 'We are talking to Steve Bruce and my chairman is talking to their chairman about the possibilities of Marlon King coming to the club. There's a long way to go but there's a bid on the table.' It is believed the offer would break the club record fee of 2million which they paid Plymouth for Peter Halmosi on Wednesday.
