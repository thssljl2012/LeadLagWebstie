 Robbie Keane is relishing the prospect of teaming up with Fernando Torres after completing his 20.3million move from Tottenham to Liverpool.Keane, the 28-year-old Republic of Ireland captain, agreed a four-year deal at Anfield after undergoing a medical at Liverpool's Melwood training ground and could now establish a mouth-watering partnership in attack with Spain striker Torres.The pair could become one of the deadliest strike combinations in the Barclays Premier League, and Keane is a big fan of his new team-mate.Welcome aboard, son: Liverpool' boss Rafa Benitez greets his new signing Robbie Keane (No 7)'He has been a revelation since he came to the Premier League. He was absolutely outstanding last year and also in the Euros with Spain,' Keane said.'It is hard to leave Tottenham with some of the players they had - like Dimitar Berbatov, who I had a great relationship with - but Torres is probably the best striker in the world right now. Hopefully we can play a lot of games together and do well.'Keane should play just off Torres in the Liverpool formation, and hopes to bridge the gap between midfield and Torres.'I see myself as a second striker,' he said. 'I can play off the shoulder, link things up and play in the hole. You are always judged on scoring goals as a striker and I have always scored a lot of goals. Hopefully I can continue that here at Liverpool.'Keano in red: Liverpool's new signing Robbie Keane with manager Rafael Benitez at the Melwood training groundThe new Reds frontman turned down Liverpool as a 14-year-old in favour of joining Wolves, and is relieved the opportunity to join the club he supports came up again.'The last four years have been great for me and I believe I am at my peak,' he said.'I am at a good age and if I didn't come to Liverpool now, maybe the opportunity wouldn't come again. It has worked out perfectly for me and, hopefully, for Liverpool Football Club as well.'Keane is set to be handed the number seven shirt, famously worn by Anfield legends including Kenny Dalglish and Kevin Keegan.Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez revealed: 'We were talking about the number, and the big names that have had this number, so it will be inspirational for him to have it too.'Benitez expects Keane, who has also played for Coventry, Inter Milan and Leeds, to strike up a fearsome partnership with Torres.'We were looking for a player with game intelligence and good movement who could play alongside Torres,' Benitez tsaid.'He can play with Torres up front and also on the right.'He is a player who can give to us a lot of goals - normally he gets about 15 each year. We were looking for the workrate he can give to us, the game intelligence and also the goals.'Keane added: 'I do not think I let Spurs down. I had six fantastic seasons there and gave them everything. Since day one.'I always give everything, and that will never change. The Spurs fans were always magnificent to me and I will always have a place in my heart for them.'But this is a new chapter in my life and one that I am looking forward to. I had six great years at Spurs and thank them for that.Keane will now wear the No 7 shirt at Liverpool made famous by legends like Kenny Dalglish and Kevin Keegan.Keane said: 'To wear that shirt is an honour, and something I truly understand. If I can have half as much success in it as Keegan and Dalglish did, I will be a happy man'He added: 'I've been waiting for this day since I was a kid. Everyone knows I am a massive Liverpool fan, so to be sitting here today in a Liverpool tracksuit is a dream come true.'I always wanted to be a footballer as a kid, but also to play for Liverpool.'Maybe you never feel it is going to happen. I could have come here as a teenager, but chose Wolves because I felt there would be more chance of immediate first team football, and that proved to be the case.'Now I am enjoying every minute and I can't wait to pull on that red shirt.'This is a massive club and want to do everything I can to make them even moresuccessful.'The reasons I left Spurs are that I am a huge Liverpool fan and the chance to play for them may never come around again.'This opportunity is something I couldn't let go. I am at an age now when I believe I am at my peak, and aim to kick on.'This is a great opportunity now for me, the whole package that Liverpool has to offer really inspires me.'I am just grateful to be here. I love the club and this is the one dream Ihad still achieve.'Add your comments View allComments (8)Here's what readers have had to say so far. Why not add your thoughts below?This is a great signing for Liverpool. Gerrard will have to targets to feed up front now. I don't think it is chest thumping. Liverpool have a good chance. Arsenal is floundering, Man Utd. is on the brink of losing Ronaldo, and Chelsea are rebuilding. This could be their year!- Patrick, Cincinnati, USA, 29/7/2008 14:22The big question is not how well he will do as we all know his ability in the premiership but, the major question is will Rafa use him in the right way and how often he will be playing? Rafa has already mentioned he can play on the right so I hope he does not play him there instead of supporting Torres up front.- Felix, London, 29/7/2008 14:09Sorry Robbie! We break the top 4 and Liverpool will be 5th!Good Luck- Spursfan, St.Plten Austria, 29/7/2008 12:11**yourComments**- **name**, **townAndCountry**, **creationDate**Add your commentName: Email: Your email address will not be published Town &amp;amp; Country: Your comments:You have 1000 characters left.Remember me - this will save you having to type out your name, location and email address when you next leave a comment.
