    Mia Tern:  Good Morning,  I posted this late last night (my time) and thought I&amp;#039;d bump it ~ because it was disappearing into the previous pages:      Mia Tern:   Hi...    This comment was made (in part) by Greg:       I thought the discussion was over whether or not Jesus claimed to be God. Like the one dude said, he wouldn&amp;#039;t shut up about it.       If He wouldn&amp;#039;t shut up about it why didn&amp;#039;t Jesus ever say even once :    I am God ~ worship me?    IF Jesus had said those few words there were be no discussion about it now. Jesus didn&amp;#039;t.    What Jesus did say time and time again ... and God confirmed... Jesus was the Son of God. God Almighty confirmed this not just once but on two separate occasions:       M&amp;#039;t:3:17: And lo a voice from heaven, saying,  This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.         M&amp;#039;t:17:5: While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said,  This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.        God cannot and did not lie. IF Jesus was 100% God in the flesh ~ God would have said so on those two separate occasions. God did not.                John 1:1,14~  &amp;quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word   was God  .... And the Word   became flesh, and dwelt among us  .....&amp;quot;               Phil. 2:6-8~  &amp;quot;...although He (Jesus)   existed in the form of God  ,  did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,  but   emptied Himself  , taking the form of a bond-servant,  and being made in the   likeness of men  .  And being found in appearance as a man,  He   humbled   Himself by   becoming   obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.              Firstborn in Greek means preeminent, not the first one born.   Col  1:15   says that   Jesus was preeminent over creation  .  Firstborn in Hebrew means both the first one born and can also mean preeminent.  An Example: In Genesis 41:51-52 Manassah is the firstborn.  Yet in Jeremiah 31:9, Ephraim is firstborn (preeminent over Manessah).  Manassah was dropped out because of his sins.           The word &amp;quot;beginning&amp;quot; in Revelation 3:14 is from the Greek word &amp;quot;arche&amp;quot;, which means   first cause  .  Some translations render this verse &amp;quot;JESUS IS: the beginner (Goodspeed),  the moving cause (Barclays),  the prime source (  NEB  ),  the ultimate source (JB) OF GOD&amp;#039;S CREATION&amp;quot;.  Since the use of the Greek word arche in   Revelation 1:8 and 21:6 does not mean that God the father had a created beginning-   why insist that arche in   Revelation 3:14 means that Jesus had a created beginning?                Jesus is not Gods Son in the sense of how we think of a father and a son.  God did not get married and have a son.  Jesus is Gods Son in the sense that He is God made manifest in human form.          Col. 2:9, &amp;quot;For in Him [Jesus] all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form.&amp;quot;              Jesus is ALSO called the Son of Man   88 times in the New Testament.    God called the prophet Ezekiel &amp;quot;son of man&amp;quot; 93 times.  God was simply calling Ezekiel a human being.  A son of a man is a man.       The son of God is God.......    Jesus is God manifest in the flesh.            For by  HIM   (Jesus)  ALL THINGS  were created:  things in heaven- and on earth,  visible and invisible,  whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities;   ALL THINGS  were created  BY   him and  FOR   him.    He is before all things,    and in him   all things hold together  .    Col 1:16-17
