   Firstborn in Greek means preeminent, not the first one born.  This verse is saying that Jesus was preeminent over creation.   So it should read than if this is true as follows     Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn   over    every creature:  As apposed to   Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn    of    every creature:  over vs of ??? Did the KJ bible get this passage wrong Jacki?      Firstborn in Hebrew means both the first one born and can also mean preeminent.    LOL No doubt God made all things for him after all yes no he would have in subjection these things no arguments you still can&amp;#039;t even get the car out of the rage on Christ having a beginning     31:9, Ephraim is firstborn (preeminent over Manessah).  Manassah was dropped out because of his sins.    Uhim yes and?????    Also- Proverbs 8:22 (God produced Jesus as the first of his works)?  Hey know your getting it Don&amp;#039;t like the NWT try ASV or Geneva Bible it will convey the same thought. read even further rand the context as to this reality is even solidified all the more   In fact I think that his is such an excellent set of scriptures to disprove the trinity Even all the more lets examine them here   to v31 if U would?  ASV prove this reality Nicely   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16625&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 22&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.  &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16626&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 23&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  I was set up from everlasting,    from the beginning   , Before the earth was.   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16627&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 24&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16628&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 25&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16629&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 26&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16630&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 27&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;     When he established the heavens, I was there   : When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16631&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 28&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16632&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 29&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16633&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 30&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;     Then I was by him,       as a master workman   ; And I was daily his delight, Rejoicing always before him,   &amp;amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;en-ASV-16634&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;sup&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 31&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men.      Jesus was with Jehovah when he made the rest of creation a master worker it calls him working by his fathers side          us.       -And- Revelation 3:14 (Jesus is the beginning of God&amp;#039;s creation. He had a beginning)?    And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness,    the beginning of the creation of God:   *Raises hand* Um so like why all the supportive scriptures LOL disproving the trinity??               The word beginning in this verse is from the Greek word &amp;quot;arche&amp;quot;,  which means first cause.    LOL Again what kind of Angel do we call Jesus Oh Jacki this is the most awesome post you ever posted LOL no kidding either. to round out the argument on this one through Isaiah 9:6 itself calls Jesus a prince. If you can find a scripture that shows any other heavenly figure Not being a prince outside of Micheal in the bible in terms of being or residing in heaven I&amp;#039;ll buy you a new Marcedes     Some translations render this verse- &amp;quot;JESUS IS: the beginner (Goodspeed),  the moving cause (Barclays),  the prime source (NEB),  the ultimate source (JB) ... OF GOD&amp;#039;S CREATION&amp;quot;.    OK great Jesus is the beginning of Gods creation    Since the use of the Greek word arche in Revelation 1:8 and 21:6 does not mean that God the father had a created beginning,  No it calls God THE FATHER the Alpha and the Omega showing that  why insist that arche in Revelation 3:14 means that Jesus had a created beginning?    LOL 3:14 is speaking of Jesus and the other two passages Rev 1:8,21:6are talking bout God the almighty the one we call Jehovah God         Phil.2:5-8 Who being in the form of (nature) God- (Gal. 4:8: there is only one God by nature)- did not consider it robbery to be equal with God.    In Gods form,............... a spirit person not god himself LOL   Galatians Paul is asking the question Hey there is one God that is true so how could any other God be equal to that one. This scripture seems to suggest Jacki what Isaiah 9;6 states regarding the title of God as referenced to Jesus a Mighty not almighty God thus He being a God is not equal with God thus further verifying John 14:28.     The reason for his asking this to begin with of course many ancient congregations had issues with idolatry    But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men (nature)-  Sure He is Gods only begotten Son Christ Jesus yes as a man he made himself lower than the angels    In becoming a man something CHANGED since he was not in a servant role to the Father before He became man.     True but his supposed equality with God never existed to begin with the the point you are trying to make here has little value   This was a change of position, not a change in nature.    True but again he never had equality with God to being with how could he he was the first born of all creation as the scriptures through out it seems clearly verify    He, as God, could not empty himself of His essential nature, since unchangeableness is part of his nature.   All His attributes are eternal so he could not eliminate any but he could put them aside in using them as He entered time and space to reach mankind.   That is how powerful God is!   That right there sounded a little like :KuJyTHeGK XGHIPU PUIO KJoBH KLiNB IUG IUGH&amp;gt; IGU KJV MHB IUG LIBIUG IUH K JuB KJNB JKLOHB POIU YN IOPJN OIHB IUHN {MJUINJ HPoi to me and if anyone can clarify it please do    Isn&amp;#039;t the Trinidadian argument when it come to scriptures like Matt 3;16,17 to straight at you with th a t glazed over Duh it should be obvious look and express anything is possible for God. Just set aside logic and reasoning yet her e all the sudden he isessential nature is now conveniently unchangeable wow I thought False religion was always about having your way I never thought that means two opposing ways       Col. 1:16-17 Speaking of the Son;  For BY HIM (Jesus) ALL THINGS WERE CREATED- that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.    And than U yet again for making the argument for the unitarian point of view so EZ Jacki   It is true that all things where created by Christ after his being made by virtue of being the first Born of all creation Col 1:15 Moreover Prov 8:30 Shows He was the Master worker by his fathers side helping him making the rest of creation   The text is revealing that it was in Him that all things were created (Greek- en as the essential instrumental of agency).   Yes after his coming into existence by virtue of God making him first as 1 col 1:15 says and Prov 8:30 validates than yes as does the verses you have here that are after 1 Col1:15 v&amp;#039;s 16 and 17 where than made Jesus the master worker helped aid his father in creation of all things there after           th thine own Self with the glory which I had WITH THEE before the world was-&amp;quot; Here is Jesus asking to be restored to His glory that He always had but was presently hidden under the veil of flesh.    As a spirit p[erson and an immortal one at that       The Father speaking, in Hebrews v.8 - But to the Son He says: Your throne, O God is forever and ever... God, even thy God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. (Heb.1:8)   Here is God the Father saying to the Son He is God and he has a throne which is ETENAL.      the throne is forever but not Christs setting on it that lasts a thousand years Rev 20:1-4hence the term eternal is referencing the idea that something is forever but it has conditions attached to it. In gods new word people on Earth will have eternal life but they must be faithful and loyal to Jehovah if they are not they will suffer the sameplight as Adam and Eve did. Thus the term Eternal while meaning forever has implicate restrictive measures applied to it. This being a restriction of time as regards Christ the Lamb setting on his Fathers throne this is why in Isaiah 9:6 Jesus is called eternal Father     In Heb.1:10 The Father speaking of the Son says, You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands... and they shall be changed: but thou art the same.      Jesus may have laid the foundation he was the master worker along side his father prov 8:30 clearly shows us this    This is a quote from the Old Testament of Psalm 102:25 and is speaking of God.   Ummm where is it? LOL besides both considered together one speaking of Jesus in heb 1:10 and Ps 102:25 shows that God had assistance not that he needed any but he is a dignified guy too He knows that Jesus would like to help he lets him validates in Pr 8:30      The writer attributed the &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; Yahweh to the Son in Heb 1:10, and the Father addresses the Son as eternal and being immutable they will perish, you will remain.      Oh boy just by virtue of the words In the beginning you laid the foundation for the Earth and the heavens Sheesh ignoresCo1:15 Christ is the first Born of all creationand now Prov 6:30 too LOL Christ is a master work...
